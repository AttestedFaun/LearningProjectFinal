"2","Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most famous opposition figure and President Vladimir Putin’s most effective rival, has been reported dead. Russian state media — which is loath to even say Navalny’s name — reported the death on Friday. Prison authorities say Navalny fell unconscious and died after taking a walk in the prison complex where he has been held since December. Though it’s difficult to verify information coming from the Russian state apparatus, Navalny’s team indicated they believe the reports to be true due to unusual conditions around the prison camp close to the Arctic Circle where Navalny was being held, namely that they could not make contact with the prison . Navalny’s lawyers are headed to the prison to investigate his death, according to his spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh . Navalny’s partner, Yulia Navalnaya , appeared at the Munich Security Conference Friday and warned that Putin’s regime is not to be trusted but, should the reports of Navalny’s death be true, “I would like Putin and all his staff, everybody around him, his government, his friends, I want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done with our country, with my family and with my husband.” Whether the Putin regime directly assassinated Navalny or his death was the result of grueling conditions — including being poisoned in 2020, being held in Russian penal colonies, and going on a hunger strike in 2021 — it will be understood by many as a signal about Russia’s future. US President Joe Biden , for example, said the US did not know details of what happened but told reporters Friday: “Make no mistake: Putin is responsible for Navalny’s death.” Navalny’s reported death comes right before the country’s March elections, in which he was attempting from jail to persuade fellow Russians to reject Putin , who is essentially guaranteed a fifth term. “The war against liberalism that we have seen in Russia, taking place at the same time as the war against Ukraine, [the Kremlin] is doubling down on that,” Graeme Robertson, director of the Center for Slavic, Eurasian, and East European Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told Vox in an interview. “Their sense of their ability to act with impunity is really just, it’s really off the charts.” That impunity also signals to Russians in the country and the diaspora that there’s no Russia without Putin. Navalny, the anti-corruption campaigner During the late 2000s, Navalny made his name as an anti-corruption blogger, Vox’s Alex Ward wrote in 2021. But it was during the wave of anti- government protests, or the so-called Snow Revolution , starting in 2011, that Navalny first came to national prominence. At the time, he was one of the many voices denouncing the Putin regime after Putin announced his return to the presidency and his United Russia party was caught rigging a legislative election . Navalny ran on a highly nationalistic platform for mayor of Moscow in 2013, losing to Putin ally Sergei Sobyanin. And though his platform was alienating to many young urban people who might have otherwise been interested in an opposition candidate, his impressive showing paved the way for him to stay in the political spotlight — and seek more power. Over time, Navalny realized that his nationalistic and Islamophobic message wasn’t going to appeal to a broad swath of Russians and instead focused on corruption, something he thought people could see made their everyday lives more difficult. He built a network of opposition politicians throughout Russia and a massive social media following, in part through posting corruption exposés on YouTube . That built Navalny’s profile, but it could only do so much to challenge Putin’s popularity. “Millions of people saw [Navalny’s] videos,” Robertson said. “Millions of people are very aware of how corrupt their system is. But on a certain level, it doesn’t attach itself to Putin, it doesn’t attach itself to the higher levels of the Russian state, in part because people see it as inevitable — they’re criminals, but they’re our criminals.” Navalny announced in 2016 that he would run for president against Putin in the elections two years later. Though that campaign was likely largely symbolic — given both the doubts about how free or fair those elections were and Navalny’s low levels of support among Russians — his international support picked up over time, as he became one of the only vocal dissidents within Russia. Since the widespread protests of 2011 to 2013, the Kremlin has cracked down on essentially all types of opposition to the Putin regime , and in many ways, it seems as though any hope for a free Russia has died with Navalny. What does his death mean to the Kremlin, to Russians, and to the world? Navalny has been imprisoned several times; in 2014 he was put under house arrest for embezzlement charges that critics say were meant to discredit him, and he was detained in 2019 for what authorities claimed was an unauthorized protest. In August 2020, Navalny was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok while on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow; he spent several months in Germany recovering from the near-fatal poisoning. When he returned to Russia in January 2021, he was almost immediately detained and imprisoned until at least 2031 for various charges, including extremism . “We’re in this perpetual state of being shocked but not surprised” about Navalny’s death, Sam Greene, director for democratic resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told Vox in an interview. “There’s no question about who’s culpable, but how that culpability is structured is a question to which we’ll probably never know the answer. The fundamental truth is that the Kremlin killed its most potent opponent.” That is how Navalny’s death is being processed among Russian dissident expatriates. “This is not death, this is a brutal murder,” Russian dissident and member of the artist collective Pussy Riot Nadya Tolokonnikova wrote on her Instagram Friday. “Navalny is the soul of free Russia and I, like you all, was sure that he is immortal as a soul.” Navalny’s probable death strengthens a reality Putin has been building in Russia for a while — that there is no alternative to Putin, and that there is no hope and no room for dissent. “Now, there’s not even the slightest public wiggle room when it comes to opposition,” Eliot Borenstein, interim vice chancellor and vice provost for Global Programs at New York University, told Vox in an interview. Since Putin’s return to power, Russia has made public dissent almost impossible, essentially outlawing the free press or pushing it into exile , outlawing protests and speech that condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine , and most recently, cracking down on LGBTQ Russians by labeling the global LGBTQ movement an extremist movement . That’s not to mention the effects of those crackdowns and what happens to people who dissent — whether that’s arrest, prison, or worse. “That’s been the goal for years — to make post-Putin Russia, Russia without Putin, unimaginable,” Borenstein said.

"2","Two recent verdicts have now left Donald Trump on the hook for nearly half a billion dollars. On Friday, a New York judge handed the former president a $355 million penalty , and banned him from serving in a leadership position in any business in New York for three years, for fraudulently inflating his net worth to lenders in order to receive more favorable loan agreements. And in January, a Manhattan jury ordered Trump to pay the writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her after she accused him of raping her. (A separate jury in May had found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s.) Together, the damages from these two lawsuits are worth more than the amount of cash Trump claimed to have on hand last April, potentially putting him in a financial bind as he also faces debt repayments and mounting legal fees . Even if he appeals these decisions, as he is expected to do, he still likely will have to front the money while that process runs its course, or secure a bond , which would come with its own conditions. For a well- connected billionaire, that might usually amount to nothing more than a temporary inconvenience; after all, Trump could always liquidate some of his assets or borrow even more money to cover his short-term obligations. But Trump isn’t just one of the country’s richest men , with an estimated net worth in the low billions; he’s also running to serve a second term as president of the United States. And for any candidate for public office — let alone the presidency — being cash-strapped while owing such significant amounts of money could be a serious liability. “It’s pretty scary from an ethics perspective,” said Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a nonpartisan watchdog group that has chronicled Trump’s abuses of power and filed lawsuits against him . You don’t have to look far to find the reasons why. Trump’s first term was riddled with conflicts of interest , and that’s in no small part because of his financial well-being (or lack thereof, depending on how you look at it). At the time that he tried to overturn the 2020 election , he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt , largely stemming from loans to help rehabilitate his struggling businesses, and most of which would be coming due over the subsequent four years. Throughout his presidency, he refused to divest from his businesses, which made millions of dollars in revenue from taxpayers and continued to do work with other countries while he was in office — a practice he indicated he would repeat in a second term. The fact that he has so many entanglements with big businesses and other nations leaves plenty of room for things to go awry. That’s why a 2020 New York Times exposé uncovering his staggering debt during his first term wasn’t just embarrassing for Trump, who has a tendency to claim he’s richer than he actually is. It also raised fears about how his debt could implicate national security . As the former head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division told Time magazine in 2020 , “For a person with access to U.S. classified information to be in massive financial debt is a counterintelligence risk because the debt-holder tends to have leverage over the person, and the leverage may be used to encourage actions, such as disclosure of information or influencing policy, that compromise U.S. national security.” As Trump campaigns for a second term, his personal finances are becoming increasingly relevant, especially now that he has to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the two civil lawsuits. And with his criminal cases still looming , things could get even worse for him. His debt “makes him prime for corruption and really exploiting his office for his own personal gain,” Canter said. Is Trump actually in any financial trouble? Trump is known for many things, but a penchant for transparency is not one of them. He famously didn’t release his tax returns when he was running for office, and because his company is not publicly traded, its finances are often opaque. As a result, his personal net worth and his business empire’s earnings have always been shrouded in mystery. But lawsuits, media reports, and his occasional, if narrow, public disclosures have made clear that Trump’s often rosy descriptions of his wealth are far from accurate. It’s particularly unclear just how big his cash reserves are. In a deposition last year, Trump claimed to have $400 million in cash. That is a lot of money, but if it’s accurate, the former president likely would not have much of it left after paying the damages from his recent lawsuits. (While he can, in some cases, dip into campaign cash to cover certain legal expenses , he generally can’t use those funds to pay the damages he owes.) Lawsuits aside, Trump also has plenty of debt on his hands. His financial disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission last year showed that he has at least $200 million in debt. And according to Forbes , his business owed roughly $1.3 billion in 2021. That’s not as dire as it sounds, especially because Trump has been steadily paying down the money he owed when he was leaving the White House three years ago. For example, he’s paid off most of the $295 million he owed Deutsche Bank — a major source of his debt . But some of Trump’s debts warrant more scrutiny . Ultimately, it’s impossible to know exactly how financially stable Trump is at any given moment. While some signs — like his ability to repay some of his debts or, say, him being a very wealthy man with very wealthy friends — indicate that he’s doing just fine, there are still some warning signs for his campaign. Trump has faced a steady stream of hefty legal bills that stem from his four indictments, and that has drained much of his campaign cash. In fact, Trump’s campaign has spent more than $50 million on legal fees in the past year alone . According to the Associated Press, 84 percent of spending from Trump’s Save America political action committee has gone toward covering legal expenses. Those aren’t exactly the typical spending habits of a normal campaign. But then again, Trump isn’t a normal candidate. Trump’s income and lack of transparency really matters One of the most explosive details in the New York Times’s 2020 report on Trump’s leaked tax returns is that despite being incredibly rich, there were years that he paid little to no federal income tax. In 2016, when he first won the presidency, he had paid a grand total of $750 in federal income taxes. That could help explain why Trump refused to release his tax returns in the first place, though doing so has been the norm for presidential candidates since the 1970s . As serious as it is that Trump ( and other wealthy Americans ) can pay virtually no federal income taxes, there are even bigger consequences to his lack of transparency. Trump’s web of business deals also provides ample opportunity for special interests and foreign governments to attempt to buy influence in his administration. Foreign governments, for example, spent millions of dollars at Trump’s businesses during his presidency. A Chinese state-owned bank paid $7 million to rent space in Trump Tower in New York during the four years Trump was president. The company stopped renting out space when Trump left office . To believe that the potential for that kind of revenue could not influence Trump’s agenda, or even travel itinerary, would require an extraordinary level of trust in the former president — something most voters don’t have . After all, how could a president fairly pursue a trade deal, for example, with a country he’s doing personal business with? It’s that kind of behavior that led to accusations that Trump violated the emoluments clauses of the US Constitution, which bar presidents from receiving money from foreign governments, as well as US states or the federal government outside their salary, in order to avoid undue influence. During his presidential term, Trump also had many hidden debts, and while a lot of his creditors were big financial institutions, some were unknown. According to Forbes, for example, Trump had a previously undisclosed loan from a foreign creditor when he became president, owing nearly $20 million to a South Korean company . While Trump paid off that loan within the first six months he was in office, it’s just one example of how his potential conflicts of interest are tricky to keep track of. In the runup to 2016, Trump misleadingly touted his wealth as a key advantage that furthered the public interest. He promised to self-fund his campaign, saying that he wouldn’t be beholden to anybody, but he failed to keep that pledge . But the problem for Trump isn’t just his inability to self- fund his White House bids. The fact that he is constantly on the lookout for new loans or sources of income gives special interests a vehicle to curry favor with him. After his former lenders cut ties with him in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, for example, Axos Bank, whose CEO is a Republican donor, swooped in and loaned the former president some $225 million, helping Trump shore up his finances. (Trump has also reported new income from foreign entities, like a new deal he struck with a Saudi-based firm.) While Trump’s lack of transparency might have served him well until now, shielding him from potential legal and political liabilities, it also could have far-reaching consequences should he win a second term this November. “A lot of people thought Bernie Madoff was rich,” Canter said. “There are a lot of characters who portray themselves as rich, but when you look into the cookie jar, there’s nothing there.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Last week, California state Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) introduced a landmark new piece of AI legislation aimed at “establishing clear, predictable, common-sense safety standards for developers of the largest and most powerful AI systems.” It’s a well-written, politically astute approach to regulating AI, narrowly focused on the companies building the biggest-scale models and the possibility that those massive efforts could cause mass harm. As it has in fields from car emissions to climate change , California’s legislation could provide a model for national regulation, which looks likely to take much longer. But whether or not Wiener’s bill makes it through the statehouse in its current form, its existence reflects that politicians are starting to take tech leaders seriously when they claim they intend to build radical world-transforming technologies that pose significant safety risks — and ceasing to take them seriously when they claim, as some do, that they should do that with absolutely no oversight. What the California AI bill gets right One challenge of regulating powerful AI systems is defining just what you mean by “powerful AI systems.” We’re smack in the middle of the present AI hype cycle, and every company in Silicon Valley claims that they’re using AI, whether that means building customer service chatbots, day trading algorithms, general intelligences capable of convincingly mimicking humans, or even literal killer robots . Defining the question is vital, because AI has enormous economic potential, and clumsy, excessively stringent regulations that crack down on beneficial systems could do enormous economic damage while doing surprisingly little about the very real safety concerns. The California bill attempts to avoid this problem in a straightforward way: it concerns itself only with so-called “frontier” models, those “ substantially more powerful than any system that exists today .” Wiener’s team argues that a model which meets the threshold the bill sets would cost at least $100 million to build, which means that any company that can afford to build one can definitely afford to comply with some safety regulations. Even for such powerful models, the requirements aren’t overly onerous : The bill requires that companies developing such models prevent unauthorized access, be capable of shutting down copies of their AI in the case of a safety incident (though not other copies — more on that later), and notify the state of California on how they plan to do all this. Companies must demonstrate that their model complies with applicable regulation (for example from the federal government — though such regulations don’t exist yet, they may at some point). And they have to describe the safeguards they’re employing for their AI and why they are sufficient to prevent “critical harms,” defined as mass casualties and/or more than $500 million in damages. The California bill was developed in significant consultation with leading, highly respected AI scientists, and released with endorsements from leading AI researchers, tech industry leaders, and advocates for responsible AI alike. It’s a reminder that despite vociferous, heated online disagreement, there’s actually a great deal these various groups agree on. “AI systems beyond a certain level of capability can pose meaningful risks to democracies and public safety,” Yoshua Bengio, considered one of the godfathers of modern AI and a leading AI researcher, said of the proposed law. “Therefore, they should be properly tested and subject to appropriate safety measures. This bill offers a practical approach to accomplishing this, and is a major step toward the requirements that I’ve recommended to legislators.” Of course, that’s not to say that everyone loves the bill. What the California AI bill doesn’t do Some critics have worried that the bill, while it’s a step forward, will be toothless in the case of a truly dangerous AI system. For one thing, if there’s a safety incident requiring a “full shutdown” of an AI system, the law doesn’t require you to retain the capability to shut down copies of your AI which have been released publicly, or are owned by other companies or other actors. The proposed regulations are easier to comply with, but because AI, like any computer program, is so easy to copy, it means that in the event of a serious safety incident, it wouldn’t actually be possible to just pull the plug. “When we really need a full shutdown, this definition won’t work,” analyst Zvi Mowshowitz writes . “The whole point of a shutdown is that it happens everywhere whether you control it or not.” There are also many concerns about AI that can’t be addressed by this particular bill. Researchers working on AI anticipate that it will change our society in many ways (for better and for worse), and cause diverse and varied harms: mass unemployment, cyberwarfare, AI-enabled fraud and scams, algorithmic codification of biased and unfair procedures, and many more. To date, most public policy on AI has tried to target all of those at once: Biden’s executive order on AI last fall mentions all of these concerns. These problems, though, will require very different solutions, including some we have yet to imagine. But existential risks, by definition, have to be solved to preserve a world in which we can make progress on all the others — and AI researchers take seriously the possibility that the most powerful AI systems will eventually pose a catastrophic risk to humanity. Regulation addressing that possibility should therefore be focused on the most powerful models, and on our ability to prevent mass casualty events they could precipitate. At the same time, a model does not have to be extremely powerful to pose serious questions of algorithmic bias or discrimination — that can be done with an extremely simple model that predicts recidivism or eligibility for a mortgage on the basis of data that reflects decades of past discriminatory practices. Tackling those issues will require a different approach, one less focused on powerful frontier models and mass casualty incidents and more on our ability to understand and predict even simple AI systems. No one law could possibly solve every challenge that we’ll face as AI becomes a bigger and bigger part of modern life. But it’s worth keeping in mind that “don’t release an AI that will predictably cause a mass casualty event,” while it’s a crucial element of ensuring that powerful AI development proceeds safely, is also a ridiculously low bar. Helping this technology reach its full potential for humanity — and ensuring that its development goes well — will require a lot of smart and informed policymaking. What California is attempting is just the beginning. A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here! Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","It was all the way back in the spring of 2018 that Mindy Kaling tweeted, in response to the onslaught of hot fashion people wearing a certain kind of eyewear, “I think we will regret this tiny sunglasses look.” Anne Hathaway then immortalized the tweet by posting a screenshot and writing, “I’ll sit this one out with you.” Even Ryan Reynolds, who has never been known for fashion criticism, mocked the trend on Instagram not once, but twice . Unfortunately for Hathaway, Kaling, and Reynolds, in the six years since, tiny sunglasses have not gone away. In fact, they’ve become the de facto shape for not just shades, but regular eyeglasses for a particular type of cool young person: Doja Cat wore them to the Grammys . Recent SNL musical guest Reneé Rapp wore them when she took an iconic tumble on her birthday. Internet it- girls like MUNA’s Katie Gavin , model Gabbriette , and Blizzy McGuire regularly post themselves in tiny eyeglasses. Sexyy Red’s been wearing them for years . Because no fashion trend can really be so named without a signoff by Bella Hadid, she’s also credited as an early adopter . View this post on Instagram A post shared by @reneerapp Online, they’re categorized as Bayonetta glasses, after the 2009 video game character, “office siren” glasses, or, a personal favorite, “ cunty librarian glasses .” Basically, they’re small and sort of severe, usually rectangular but sometimes rounded at the corners. To the average onlooker, they’re no different from the cheap reading glasses you’d find near the checkout aisle at the grocery store. But to the stylish and the aesthetically blessed, they’re among the sexiest things you can wear right now. “The small rectangular ones, I really can’t keep a hold on. Those are the ones that go really quickly,” says AZYR Specs founder Maureen Ryza. Her brand refurbishes vintage frames with updated lenses, and Ryza says that the most popular eras are futuristic ’60s styles and the small ’90s shapes. “When you put on those kinds of glasses, you’re putting on a persona more so than just wearing glasses to shield your eyes.” What tiny eyeglasses communicate can depend on their context. You can do them à la Miu Miu , in a prim-but-a-little-silly way, or attempt the TikTok aesthetic of the “ frazzled English woman ,” named for romcom heroines like Kate Winslet in The Holiday and Bridget Jones . You can pair them with an outfit that recalls ’90s model- off-duty minimalism or Y2K-era Space Age nostalgia or Matrix cosplay . But one reference they almost always play on, no matter the outfit, is that of the sexy librarian, among the more durable archetypes in American culture. “It’s librarian chic — it’s breaking this paradigm where glasses are associated with nerdiness, but it’s a mystique, and kind of sexy,” says Ryza. Modern stereotypes of librarians are rooted in the turn of the 20th century, when educated, middle-class white women began entering the profession. Early on, it was a job thought to employ “sexually repressed spinsters, because it was impossible for our culture to acknowledge an educated, intelligent woman with a healthy relationship to sexuality,” according to Nicole Pagowsky and Miriam Rigby’s book, The Librarian Stereotype: Deconstructing Perceptions and Presentations of Information Work . View this post on Instagram A post shared by WILFREADS (@wilfreads) But it was this very presumed sexlessness that made librarians prime fodder for the sexiest material on earth. By the early ’70s, writes David D. Squires in “ From Sensuous to Sexy: The Librarian in Post- Censorship Print Pornography ,” sexy librarians were featured in advertisements, cartoons, pulp fiction, and porn out of “a misplaced sense of irony” and “based on the paradox that a woman might be brainy and slutty.” Since then, aesthetics associated with librarians and other emblems of nerd culture have been reimagined in BDSM fashion (what’s hotter than pairing a latex suit with librarian glasses?) and then appropriated by the mainstream (think Catwoman or Lucy Liu’s character in Charlie’s Angels ). Bayonetta, for instance, caused a minor uproar in feminist gamer circles when the character debuted in 2009: Her overt sexiness was a selling point, and in an industry where women were underrepresented (especially at that point), making her a lust object was met with complicated reactions. That conversation has since reversed course, for the most part: While Bayonetta still appears in conversations about the male gaze in video games, she’s also lionized as a fabulously dressed heroine, and her glasses are now viewed as iconic rather than the remnant of a sexist trope. At least among some of us, that is. People have hated on tiny sunglasses since they reappeared in the late 2010s, for one big reason: It’s always bizarre when an item that was popular when you were younger suddenly becomes cool again, not only because it can remind you of your awkward former self but because it confirms you’re old enough to be considered “nostalgic.” True to her word, by my (extremely cursory) scroll through her socials and public appearances, Hathaway hasn’t worn a pair of teeny sunglasses since she reposted Kaling’s tweet. This is sort of funny, though, considering that part of the reason why people are talking about them in the year 2024 is because a character from her 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada has gone viral online — and it isn’t Andie Sachs. Instead, it’s her coworker Serena, played by Gisele Bündchen , who appeared in the film for “two seconds” ( her words ) but who cast a sartorial legacy that lasted much longer. Bayonetta, with “Bayonetta” glasses. Bayonetta Wiki In September, French fashion student and TikToker Asia Bieuville made a fashion mood board and titled it the “office siren;” the aesthetic draws heavily from ’90s and early 2000s minimalist ready-to-wear collections and includes a lot of sleek, tailored neutrals and basics. Others called it “ corporate core ” and drew from Gisele’s cameo as Serena (though at least one person noted that most women cannot wear most of these clothes in an actual corporate environment without a visit from HR). Bieuville says she began noticing the aesthetic on recent fashion shows by Miu Miu, Gucci under Sabato de Sarno, Shushu/Tong, and Tom Ford that gave sexy touches to traditional officewear. “I think it sends this idea that one can be sultry and serious at the same time,” she tells me over email. “Mixed with some sheer blouses and high heels, it gives you the feeling that you can be seductive and smart, an idea that was rejected by society for a long time.” Like all fashion trends , tiny eyeglasses are cool because already-hot people are wearing them. You see enough professionally cool people wearing a thing, no matter how objectively ugly it is (and tiny eyeglasses, I would argue, are not inherently ugly!), and chances are you’ll see that thing at your local Zara in a few weeks. But ignore the fast-fashion ripoffs: The season’s hottest accessory is most authentic when purchased from a thrift store or, honestly, a CVS. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","More than four months into the Israel-Hamas war , Gaza residents are struggling to survive winter conditions with insufficient food, drinking water, medicine, and clothing. The majority of them have fled to Rafah, a city in the south bordering Egypt. With a prewar population of about 280,000 residents, Rafah is now housing nearly 1.5 million refugees, according to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (and confirmed by satellite images ). It was, theoretically, a refuge from the intense shelling and ground operation Israel launched after Hamas brutally attacked the country on October 7. That sense has been shattered this week. Israeli airstrikes on Monday killed about 100 people, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated a ground offensive might be imminent. Meanwhile, negotiations have stalled on discussions of a ceasefire deal and a hostage and prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas . The negotiations, helmed by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar, ground to a halt Wednesday after Netanyahu called his delegates back from a summit in Cairo, accusing Hamas of presenting “delusional” demands in order to avoid a deal. The relatives of the estimated 130 remaining hostages said the decision amounts to a “death sentence” for their family members languishing in Hamas captivity, about a quarter of whom are presumed dead. And it leaves the Palestinians sheltering in Rafah feeling even more hopeless . The Today, Explained podcast team spoke with Aseel Mousa , a Palestinian freelance journalist who grew up in Gaza, about how we got here, what it’s like on the ground right now, and what happens next. How so many Palestinians ended up in Rafah As Israel started its aerial bombardment — following the October 7 Hamas attacks, which killed about 1,200 Israelis, with more than 240 people taken hostage — it directed Gazans to flee south to avoid the fighting. That was always a fraught directive in a territory the size of Detroit but almost four times its population . But as the war has progressed, more than 85 percent of Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced. Mousa’s family is among them. On October 13, her family left their home outside Gaza City and sought shelter in the al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip. For about 80 days , they stayed in her grandfather’s house along with about 40 other displaced people. “The situation there was dire,” Mousa said. “We faced severe shortages of food, running water, and even drinkable water. And also Israel cut off electricity, communication lines, and internet access.” “And even though Israel claimed that area as a safe area, I lost 10 people of my family,” she added. “Israel targeted the house of my cousins. And as a result, 10 of my relatives were killed. Seven of them were children. And one of them was a woman. And the others were young men.” Rafah, refuge no more Mousa’s childhood home and her grandfather’s home in al-Maghazi were both bombed. As Israeli airstrikes intensified, her family fled farther south, to Rafah. Now, she and over a million other Palestinians are trapped. A sense of despair pervades Rafah, said Matthew Hollingworth of the World Food Programme, where people are scavenging for food, fuel, and shelter amid “damp, cold, and miserable” conditions.

Subscribe She called Monday’s assault “a night of terror beyond description” but said compounding the fear of death is the lack of basic supplies: “The Israeli bombardment is hard in itself, being under fire, under bombardment, she said. “But being under bombardment without even the essential needs — such as food, water, medical supplies, medicines — is making the problem or the tough time harder than enduring it with only bombing.” Is a ground offensive coming? Israeli officials say Rafah is Hamas’s last stronghold in Gaza, and that a ground offensive is needed to defeat Hamas and bring an end to the war. The UN warned that such an operation would lead to “carnage.” But Netanyahu brushed aside concerns in a Fox News interview , saying, “I think the people who are telling you, ‘Oh, you can’t do it, you can’t go into Rafah under any conditions,’ are basically saying ‘Don’t win, lose.’” Moussa says Rafah’s displaced population is dreading a ground invasion, which she said would be “a catastrophe, as … the people now have no place to go to.” “What can we do?” she said. “We stay. We stay in the houses. In the tents. In the streets. In the shelters, waiting to be killed. We don’t have a plan F. We made the plan A, plan B, plan C. And we have no more plans.” The threat of an invasion has increased pressure on US and other officials to get diplomatic negotiations back on track — for both an immediate deal and a longer-term solution. Arab states insist that after a ceasefire deal is reached, a two-state solution is a prerequisite to normalizing relations with Israel and rebuilding a devastated Gaza Strip. But Mousa and others like her in Rafah have more immediate concerns: “We don’t have the luxury to think of the aftermath. We only think how to survive day by day. We think of how to flee from being killed.” This story appeared originally in Today, Explained , Vox’s flagship daily newsletter. Sign up here for future editions .

"2","To love Dakota Johnson is to understand that Dakota Johnson probably hates you for it a little bit. When she was in 50 Shades of Grey , all anyone could talk about was Johnson’s sheer lack of chemistry with (and perhaps even strong distaste for) handsome costar Jamie Dornan. For a movie that’s supposed to be all about mutual appeal, the press tour lacked even the faintest suggestion of it. If you found their onscreen relationship at all convincing, Johnson would probably politely say, “I love that for you!” Even bigger than her open embrace of the 50 Shades stiffness came from Johnson’s run-in with Ellen DeGeneres . The actor confronted the terminally amicable talk show host, who had until that point held the mantle of the nicest person on TV, calling Ellen out as a liar. Technically, it was DeGeneres who snubbed Johnson’s birthday party invite, Johnson explained, not a lack of invitation. DeGeneres’s saccharine empire crumbled soon after and Johnson was cheered as the people’s princess. “It will haunt me,” she said to L’Officiel this month of the interaction, telling the publication that journalists as a whole do not understand sarcasm. Johnson’s unrelenting dryness is her hallmark, like when she famously claimed to love limes. “I love them so much. They’re great, and I love them so much, and I like to present them like this in my house,” she said, pointing to a pyramid of limes during her house tour with Architectural Digest . There was an uncanniness to her delivery; something was endearingly off. Later, on The Tonight Show, she revealed that she was actually allergic to limes, and they were planted by a set designer. “It was hard to just ignore them, so I just lied,” she said , of the citric flourish. Later, she doubled down , saying “I don’t really care about limes.” As a media personality, Johnson is organic and truly unrehearsed. But when she does or says something fascinating or amusing, she seems to think you’re the weird one for liking it. Being charming is just normal for her. Being charmed by her normality is, to her, a little silly. Putting her front and center in Madame Web , a Spider- Man-based superhero movie, is an inspired but counterintuitive choice. Superheroes are built on winning an audience over. People root for superheroes. Dakota Johnson doesn’t seem to ever want you rooting for her. And if Dakota Johnson doesn’t really care about limes, why would Johnson care about a tertiary Spider-Man character? That’s the magic of the gloriously clumsy, terrifically absurd Madame Web , a movie that Johnson herself said was maybe, probably, going to be kind of terrible. And if Dakota Johnson says something is kind of terrible, don’t you kind of want to see what she means? After all, it could just be an unenthusiastic illusion, like the limes. Don’t take Madame Web too seriously. Don’t take any superhero movie too seriously. In Madame Web , Johnson plays Cassandra “Cassie” Webb, the Spider-Lady at the heart of the movie. Even though her arthropod-esque, prophetic name kinda gives everything away, Cassie thinks she’s just a New York City EMT. What Cassie doesn’t fully know is that she has powers thanks to her late mother, an intrepid amateur arachnologist. Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) believed spiders could cure disease, specifically that there was a special spider in the Peruvian Amazon whose venom and cell structure could yield special benefits. Even seven months pregnant with Cassie, she considered that spider worth risking a jungle adventure. To communicate this potential to the audience, Constance and other characters just say “peptides” over and over, waving away technicalities, science, and logic. Cassie Webb is an EMT who hates people! Representation matters! Jessica Kourkounis/Sony Pictures If you take umbrage with that kind of storytelling, I have no idea what to tell you. That’s your own problem. This is no bait and switch. This is a movie with Dakota Johnson playing an EMT who is also a psychic Spider-Lady. This isn’t an exegesis on the themes of Foucault, but you should already know that. The writing duo behind Madame Web also gave us Morbius , a Spider-verse story about an antihero vampire in STEM , and the doomed 2017 Power Rangers reboot. Their continued Hollywood employment despite consistent clunkerdom is a feat. Like those “ movies ,” Madame Web isn’t so much a film but rather a 116-minute collection of 13-second intervals where characters tell you how they feel (usually one of sad, happy, or scared), who they are (their names, what they’re good at, and where they live), or exactly what they’re gonna do next (going to a diner, going to Peru, going to kill some people in Peru). Unfortunately for Constance, she’s not the only one who’s on the hunt — her bodyguard Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim) has been searching for the rare arachnids too, which is why he sadly needs to shoot her. Ezekiel believes in the myths of Arañas, people with spider-granted super strength who can zip through jungle trees. As Constance bleeds out in the middle of the Peruvian Amazon, she discovers that the Arañas are real. They compel their magical medical spider to sink its fangs into her, which doesn’t save Constance’s life but does save Cassie’s. It also imbues her with the power to see the future. The Arañas, thankfully, for some reason, speak English, which makes this entire kidnapping-spider-biting ritual feel less hostile, as they tell the dying Constance they’re saving her unborn baby. Like the audience watching, Constance is encouraged to just go with it. It’s unclear who named Cassie or how adoption works in the Peruvian Amazon. Being so far from civilization, the Arañas ostensibly had to care for this newborn orphan for some amount of time. Yet, Adult Cassie tells us she’s the product of the American foster care system and also somehow has a trunk full of her mom’s spider research, a series of notebooks that undoubtedly has the word “peptides” underlined over and over. Perhaps the Arañas’s real superpower was finding a way to get baby Cassie, a Peruvian immigrant, to the United States with her mom’s scientific research intact and dropping her right into the hands of CPS. Raising Cassie as an Araña would surely have been an easier time for everyone involved. But like Cassie, we cannot change what’s already been decided for us. This is Madame Web, not Señora Araña ! Cassie Webb kind of sucks, and that rules According to Spider-Man lore, a radioactive eight-legged arachnid bit Peter Parker and gave him “Spidey sense” plus enhanced agility, super strength, and wall-climbing abilities. Similarly, the itsy-bitsy that bit Miles Morales activated those gifts plus invisibility and bioelectric venom strike. In the Spider-Verse, spiders bite people and grant them the powers they share. Going by this logic, the spider that bit Cassie’s mom could see the future and maybe, was kind of a jerk. Unfortunately, there aren’t many memorable scenes between Johnson and costar Sydney Sweeney. A DGAF-off that I would have loved to witness. Sony Pictures In this world, spiders have some kind of foresight that allows them to glimpse the future — but a very specific and localized peek and not, like, a profound understanding of the fullness and fabric of time. The power functions like déjà vu, as the spider would ostensibly fully live through one version of the future and snap back to 30 seconds before it all happened. Given that a spider’s life in the Peruvian Amazon is probably filled with all kinds of threats, this way of living would probably make it a little bit supernaturally cranky. This heightened anticipation also explains how the spider managed to elude humans for so long. Like the spider that bit her mom, Adult Cassie doesn’t particularly enjoy human interaction. This might seem at odds with Cassie’s vocation as a post-9/11 first responder — the movie is set in 2003 — until you remember that Cassie helps people who are usually extremely injured and unconscious. Cassie dodges her own captain’s baby shower with a Johnson-esque “I don’t want to get roped into that.” She’s mostly okay with only one coworker, her partner Ben Parker (Adam Scott). Yes, that name is supposed to raise all kinds of alarms, as does the fact that Ben has a pregnant sister named Mary (Emma Roberts). That sure would make him an uncle named Ben. Johnson delivers all of Cassie’s lines — from saying “you’re welcome” to the loved ones of her patients to telling party attendees that her dead mom was probably irresponsible — with weaponized uptalk. Uptalk, some researchers say , is designed to slyly announce dominance in a submissive way; it’s an assertion disguised as a question. In Cassie’s voice, it feels like she’s asking the audience to empathize with the dolts around her. Madame Web and her spider-teen charges. Sony Pictures This isn’t that different from how the real Dakota Johnson , daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson and granddaughter of Tippi Hedren, speaks: fearless deadpan combined with condescending inquisitiveness to create an undertone of cool menace. Johnson is not a chameleon, and her best roles have tapped into that unreadable opacity, making use of her ability to turn others into the inconsequential lime sitting on her counter. In Madame Web , Johnson’s delivery often feels like she’s making fun of the movie she’s in. Every line has a wink, a vague suggestion to the audience that she can’t believe she’s saying things like “The best part of the future is that it hasn’t happened yet” either. Yet her half-hearted commitment to the bit is endearing because maybe superhero movies are made to be laughed at. Extremely stupid and extremely fun are not mutually exclusive. Instead of her power allowing her to win the lottery or at least invest in pre-iPhone Apple , Cassie has to use her power to protect three teenage girls — played by Sydney Sweeney, Isabel Merced, and Celeste O’Connor — from Ezekiel, who is back from his own trip to the Amazon. She’s extremely annoyed that her precognitive abilities have turned her into a very powerful au pair. “Don’t do dumb stuff,” she tells the girls. Unfortunately, teenage girls aren’t easily frightened by uptalk inflection. They continue to do dumb stuff, and Cassie considers abandoning them. Cassie Webb is perhaps the most relatable superhero in the Spider-Verse. Ezekiel has foreseen, via spider bite, that these teens will eventually become superhero Spider-Women and kill him. He’s hired a woman named Amaria (Zosia Mamet, another talented nepo baby) to hack into the NSA and track the girls, an extraneous plot device but one that allows Mamet to shine as a snarky lady computer genius in a room of screens and monitors. Like its superhero movie brethren, one of the huge reasons Madame Web exists is to lock in IP and tease out the possibility of more superhero movies. The girls in the film will grow up to be comic book superheroes known as Spider-Woman , Spider-Girl , and also Spider-Woman (titles in comics get passed around a lot). Cassie becomes the psychic, future-manipulating powerhouse known as Madame Web. Given Marvel’s compulsion to drive superheroes into the realm of cinematic anesthesia, Sony, perhaps unintentionally, making a movie as clumsily fun as Madame Web is refreshing. I would see at least two more of these at the theater. That’s a testament to Johnson’s innate ability to charm despite the material. Her performance feels like an inside joke that you’re lucky to be privy to. It’s as though she’s acknowledging that this whole thing — the peptides, the Arañas, the ability to read the future, this loser who wants to kill teenage girls — is all rather absurd. And that’s okay because it’s a superhero movie, but she’ll think you’re weird for liking it. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Does the US still have the power to deter its adversaries? When the US launched airstrikes earlier this month against the proxy militias linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in retaliation for the attack that killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan, President Joe Biden noted that while the US would continue to respond to Iran-linked attacks “at times and places of our choosing,” it “does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else.” Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s statement on the strikes used almost identical language . Readers of these statements might reasonably wonder how one can bomb 85 targets and kill nearly 40 people without “seeking conflict.” B-1 bombers are not exactly an instrument of Gandhian nonviolent resistance. Officially, the motivation for the strikes, according to the letter the White House sent to notify Congress in accordance with the War Powers Resolution, was to “deter the IRGC and affiliated militia groups from conducting or supporting further attacks on United States personnel and facilities.” Since the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel and the war in Gaza that followed, “deterrence” — specifically deterring Iran and its various proxies from initiating a wider regional war — has been the guiding concept behind US policy. “ Deterring a broader conflict ” was cited by Pentagon officials as the motivation for deploying more US military assets, including aircraft carriers, to the Middle East last fall. In January, the US launched military strikes in Yemen with the goal of “deterring Houthi attacks in the Red Sea .” This sort of language is not new. Establishing a “strong deterrent” against chemical weapons use was President Donald Trump’s stated motivation for launching airstrikes against Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria in 2018. President Barack Obama assured wary American allies in the Persian Gulf in 2016 that despite his attempts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, he would not hesitate to use military force to “deter” Iranian aggression. In recent cases, at least, the effectiveness of all this deterrent activity has been decidedly mixed. Iran has not yet directly attacked Israel or US military targets with its own forces. Lebanon-based Hezbollah, Iran’s most powerful proxy, has not yet launched a full-scale war with Israel, as many feared earlier in the conflict. But at the same time, US troops in the region have been targeted in dozens of attacks that have resulted in those three deaths and dozens of wounded; the exchange of fire between Hezbollah and Israel has been intensifying , even if it’s still short of all-out war; and the Iran-backed Houthis have continued their attacks on shipping, declaring that Western airstrikes “ will not deter us .” Just two days after the US strikes in early February, a drone attack claimed by Iran-linked militias against a US base in Syria killed six Kurdish fighters , who are allied with US forces in the region. At press briefings, US government spokespeople now regularly face questions about whether US deterrence in the Middle East has failed. But with conflicts on the rise globally and many longtime partners starting to question the value of US security guarantees, it’s a question that has ramifications beyond just this region. In today’s world, is the US still able to deter its adversaries? Carrying a big stick The concept of deterrence — dissuading an adversary from carrying out some action through the threat of punishment — has been a feature of international relations and military strategy since at least the ancient Greeks. The concept was fleshed out at the height of the Cold War by theorists like the Nobel Prize-winning economist Thomas Schelling, whose 1966 book Arms and Influence examined how countries can use military power — including, in the nuclear age, the power to kill millions almost instantaneously — to influence each other’s behavior. Schelling portrayed superpower competition in the nuclear era as a “competition in risk taking, characterized not so much by tests of force as by tests of nerve.” In other words, the measure of a country’s power to deter or coerce its adversaries was not just the number of troops, guns, and bombs at its disposal but its ability to create the impression that it is willing to use them, a dynamic he refers to as the “manipulation of risk.” The ongoing war in Ukraine has been a textbook lesson in the manipulation of risk. Throughout the conflict, Russia has had to tolerate billions of dollars worth of Western military aid flowing into Ukraine, significantly bolstering that country’s ability to fight. Critically, this aid is flowing from NATO countries like Poland, which are covered by a treaty that declares an attack on any member of the alliance to be an attack on all. Vladimir Putin evidently considers that guarantee credible and wants to avoid getting into a shooting war with the entire alliance by attacking the aid shipments. But deterrence cuts both ways. NATO countries want to avoid a direct war with Russia, too, particularly in light of Putin’s frequent threats to use nuclear weapons . This has limited the types of assistance they have provided to Ukraine: no NATO troops on the ground, no NATO planes enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Over time, though, the West has gradually increased the amount of aid it has provided to Ukraine, with no catastrophic nuclear response from Russia, undermining the credibility of Putin’s threats. So Ukraine is now receiving forms of aid — targeting assistance, tanks, fighter jets — that would have been unthinkable in the early days of the war, when according to many accounts keeping the fighting contained within Ukraine was a bigger priority for US security officials than Ukrainian victory. This type of escalation — gradual but without ever doing anything dramatic enough to put your adversary in a position where they feel compelled to respond — is referred to, by Schelling at others, as “Salami tactics,” meaning cutting off one thin slice at a time, eroding your opponent’s red lines without provoking them into a major response. What has not been deterred, of course, is Russia’s willingness to prosecute ongoing, extraordinarily destructive war within Ukraine itself. The limits of deterrence Bilal Saab , a former Pentagon official now with the Middle East Institute, says it’s not accurate or fair to say that the ramped- up US military presence in the Middle East has failed to deter Iran. “If there weren’t that forward deployed immediate deterrence in the region, you probably would have seen a whole lot more activity from Iran to spread its influence without being checked,” he told Vox. Saab pointed out some far more provocative actions that Iran could have taken, including an attack that killed dozens rather than just a few US soldiers or shutting down the Strait of Hormuz, which would have an even more significant impact on global energy supplies than the disruptions the Houthis have caused in their attacks on Red Sea shipping. Saab acknowledged that it’s difficult to “prove that deterrence is working because at the end of the day, you can’t prove something that didn’t happen.” At the same time, the frequent attacks by Iranian proxy groups against US military targets in the Middle East — more than 160 strikes since October, according to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies — show that there are some activities Tehran has definitely not been deterred from carrying out. “It’s basically become the status quo: a proxy group lobs rockets at US bases, then US forces bomb and kill the proxies,” said Emma Ashford , a senior fellow at the Stimson Center. Even if this state of affairs avoids a catastrophic regional war, it leaves US troops in the region — notably the roughly 2,500 in Iraq and 900 in Syria who are ostensibly there to defeat ISIS — in the crossfire. As the Economist recently noted , these troops constitute a “military presence big enough to present a menu of targets but too small actually to constrain Iran.” Jonathan Lord , a former Defense Department official who now directs the Middle East program at the Center for a New American Security, said the attacks on these targets seem calculated to “inject uncertainty into either US or Israeli decision making” but “avoid putting the US to a decision point where it has to respond forcefully.” Both sides are trying to influence the other’s behavior without sparking a conflict they can’t control. Using proxies makes it easier to maintain this balance than it would be if Iran were directly attacking the US military with its own military. Of course, even “controlled” tit-for-tat exchanges of potentially deadly fire can easily lead to unintended escalation. The strike in late January that killed three US troops may have been a case of the “dog that caught the car,” Lord said, in that it prompted the US to take much more serious action in retaliation. Some Republican critics have called for the Biden administration to take even more aggressive action to deter Iran, including striking within the country itself. Given the track record of US military interventions in the region over the past 20 years, the administration has very good reason to avoid getting involved in a direct conflict with Iran. (For what it’s worth, Trump also stopped short of striking within Iran itself, despite coming very close to doing so .) Lord said that the US reluctance to escalate is “coming from a good place and well- intentioned,” but that the strategy has essentially given Iran the message that a certain amount of violence targeting US troops will be tolerated, or at least that the response to it will be measured and limited. “[Iran] has a freer hand, knowing that we’re going to be moderating our actions,” he said. The US retaliation to the Jordan strike that killed three troops does appear to have had some effect. Iran has reportedly instructed the militia behind the attack, Kataib Hezbollah, to stand down, and the number of overall strikes has since decreased. But it’s far from clear how long this will last. The US drone strike in 2020 that killed Qassem Soleimani, commander of Iran’s Quds Force and architect of its proxy network, was also supposed to restore “deterrence” against Iran. In fact, it may have made some of the proxy groups more aggressive and less predictable since Tehran’s direct control over them does not appear to be as strong as it once was. It’s another factor that makes deterrence less reliable — proxy forces may not operate under the same assumptions as their sponsors. Ashford was skeptical of the notion that military strikes against these groups constitute “deterrence” at all, in the traditional definition, noting that the whole point of deterrence is to prevent your opponent from taking some action, not responding to them after they already have. Once you’re exchanging fire with your adversary, that adversary has, by definition, not been deterred. “Either have deterrence or you don’t,” she said. “It’s either succeeding or it’s failed. Maybe you could have deterrence again in the future, but there’s no such thing as ‘restoring’ deterrence.” The future of deterrence The Middle East is not the only place where US deterrence has been called into question in recent days. At a rally in South Carolina last week, former President and current candidate Trump said he would encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries that failed to meet the alliance’s defense spending targets. Trump is not alone in calling for some European countries to meet those targets, but NATO isn’t like a country club where you have to pay your dues to get your service. With his comments, Trump fundamentally called into question the very mutual defense guarantee that has, so far, successfully deterred Russia from directly attacking NATO states. The ability to use the threat of military force to prevent an ally from attacking not only your own territory but the territory of your allies is often called “extended deterrence,” but it only works if those allies and adversaries are certain you will live up to your commitments. That credibility is tough to maintain in today’s hyperpartisan US, where — as shown by Congress’s current inability to pass aid packages for Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel — there’s little consensus on basic national security priorities or continuity between administrations. “Any country that’s in a treaty relationship, or in a treaty alliance with the United States can no longer treat Washington as a somewhat predictable being,” said Ankit Panda , a senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Allies know that Biden will, as he promised, defend “every inch” of NATO territory — as President Obama and every other postwar president before would have done. But they also know now that what the US might do in the future will depend on who sits in the White House — and which party controls Congress — in 2025 and beyond. In that context, it’s not surprising to hear serious discussion in countries that have highly adversarial neighbors, like South Korea or Poland , about obtaining nuclear weapons of their own. Even though nuclear weapons are not a failsafe guarantee against any military action, as Iran’s recent missile strikes on the territory of nuclear-armed Pakistan demonstrate, “what nuclear weapons are good at doing is deterring existential threats or major wars,” said Panda. For all that deterrence often fails, we shouldn’t overlook that since 1945, no country has used a nuclear weapon on the battlefield and only a small handful of new countries have obtained them, something that would likely have come as a surprise to leaders at the dawn of the nuclear era. But a future in which numerous countries feel so unsafe that they choose to obtain nuclear weapons is precisely the future that decades of postwar US security policy dedicated to nuclear nonproliferation sought to prevent. Averting that future is, as President John F. Kennedy said in a famous speech to the UN in 1963 , “a practical matter of life or death.” Whether it can still be averted may come down to whether other countries — both friends and enemies — still believe the US will make good on its word.

"2","The Israel Defense Forces raided Gaza’s largest still-operating hospital on Thursday in Khan Younis, a southern city that once sheltered over 100,000 displaced Palestinians but that has been under siege for weeks. The IDF told Vox that it has “credible intelligence that Hamas held hostages in Nasser Hospital. Terrorists appear to be operating from within the hospital too.” IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a statement that IDF special forces are undertaking a “precise and limited mission” to find and recover bodies of Israeli hostages that it believes to be in the hospital, citing their own intelligence and testimony from released hostages. Hamas has refuted those claims, and Vox is unable to independently verify them. This is only the latest of many hospital raids that Israel has conducted since the war began, both in Gaza and in the occupied West Bank . The raids have been a source of bitter controversy, with Israel claiming Hamas has left it with no choice but to resort to such measures while opponents of the country’s war strategy argue that nothing Hamas does can warrant the civilian suffering Israel exacts. In this and other instances, even if the IDF’s claims are true, human rights advocates say that under international humanitarian law, Israel cannot justify the dire humanitarian consequences of the raid. The IDF’s operation has forced doctors, patients, and displaced Palestinians sheltering there to flee, though many remain trapped inside, unable to leave. That’s despite the IDF’s assurances that the hospital would continue to operate and that civilians would be granted safe passage. The raid comes as Israel is reportedly considering a ground invasion of Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza whose border crossing with Egypt has remained largely closed. Israel claims Rafah is the last remaining Hamas stronghold, but any operation there would lead to “carnage,” according to the United Nations . That’s in large part because the city’s population is roughly five times larger than it was before the war , swollen by refugees fleeing the fighting further north, including in Khan Younis. It’s not clear how the US government will respond to the operation at Nasser Hospital, given increasingly critical rhetoric from top officials and the president himself. Last week, Biden said that Israel had been “over the top” in its approach in Gaza and that civilian suffering and death “had to stop.” However, he has shown no sign of wanting to withdraw any of the US’s ongoing military support to Israel. The White House and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “There is a cost for the United States in not being seen as consistent in how it judges these situations,” Michael Wahid Hanna, US program director for the International Crisis Group, told Vox in an interview. “And for many, there is a sense that such accidents elsewhere would necessarily be seen as unacceptable.” Attacks on hospitals in Syria and Ukraine, for example, have rightly been condemned by the US and the international community. What we know about the raid According to the IDF, its attack on Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis was an operation to recover the remains of Israeli hostages thought to be at the facility. The IDF told Vox, without providing any evidence to support this assertion, that “Hamas terrorists are likely hiding behind injured civilians inside Nasser Hospital right now and appear to have used the hospital to hide our hostages there too.” IDF spokesperson Hagari said in a video statement that IDF soldiers had captured suspected militants within Nasser Hospital , including some that participated in the October 7 attacks, in Thursday’s raid. A nurse in the hospital’s emergency department, whose name Vox is withholding for their safety, told Vox that there were no militants in the hospital at the time of the raid. “In a sense, [the IDF is] not trying anymore” to justify its attacks on hospitals, Hanna said. “They have sort of created the precedent and have replicated it. The preparatory steps are just being skipped at this point, and it seems like now it’s just something more akin to a standard operating procedure.” Israeli forces initially ordered the evacuation of Khan Younis in January, but many patients, medical staff, and displaced people remained at the facility. Such an evacuation is difficult — if not impossible — for the seriously sick and injured, especially without transportation like helicopters and a guaranteed safe evacuation route. And for people already displaced in Gaza, there are few other options. On Tuesday, Israel commanded everyone to evacuate prior to the raid . Vox has reviewed video footage of some medical staff and others evacuating, as well as footage of patients and displaced people crowded into an older building in Nasser Hospital, leaving the surgical and obstetrics and gynecology wards for inspection. Prior to Thursday’s IDF raid, a drone attack wounded one of the doctors working at the hospital; a separate overnight strike on the hospital wounded six patients and killed one, according to the Associated Press . The Gaza health ministry told the BBC that Israeli sniper fire killed three people and injured two on Tuesday and that a further seven people were shot and killed Monday. Medecins Sans Frontieres, one of the medical charities operating in Gaza, also said that Israel had shelled the hospital early Thursday morning, even though Israeli forces had told patients and medical staff they could stay there. “Our medical staff have had to flee the hospital, leaving patients behind,” the group wrote on the platform X on Thursday. “Israeli Forces set up a checkpoint to screen people leaving the compound; one of our colleagues was detained at this checkpoint. We call for his safety and the protection of his dignity.” There is a narrow exception to medical facilities’ protected status under international humanitarian law (IHL), but it’s not yet clear that what Israel has found at Nasser makes it exceptional. Absent overwhelming evidence that Hamas is using a given hospital to launch military attacks, experts said the facility should not be considered a military apparatus and should maintain its special protected status — and even should an attack be legal, it must be proportional. In any case, civilians inside the hospital — patients and medical staff — are still protected under IHL. Israel has been raiding hospitals for months Throughout the war in Gaza, the IDF has raided hospitals — which are protected by international humanitarian law even above other civilian infrastructure — on the basis that Hamas fighters are hiding there. Israel and the US have accused Hamas of using “human shields,” or deliberately stationing themselves in locations (like hospitals) that would make them immune to attack through the laws of war by their proximity to civilians and other protected people. The use of human shields constitutes a war crime. Hamas has denied the allegations, which Vox is unable to independently verify. Hamas does operate an extensive tunnel network under Gaza; there is evidence, including that examined by independent media outlets, that Hamas has placed some operations under hospitals before , if not established command and control centers there. Even taking those allegations to be true wouldn’t mean that Israel can just claim hospitals as legitimate military targets. Hospitals can lose their protected status under the law “when acts harmful to the enemy are being committed” at the site, said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch. Israel has presented what it says is evidence that the hospitals it has targeted are Hamas “command and control centers,” but that evidence has previously proven to be shaky . Before storming the al- Shifa hospital in November, the IDF made specific claims about how the hospital was being used by Hamas: The militant group’s activities were concentrated in five buildings atop a tunnel network that could be accessed from the hospital, which was used as a command center for rocket launches and militants. They then released photos and video of the operation that they said proved as much. But a detailed Washington Post forensic analysis later found that the “evidence presented by the Israeli government falls short of showing that Hamas has been using the hospital as a command and control center.” Even if a hospital were being used as a command and control center to commit acts harmful to the enemy, “Israeli authorities cannot treat a hospital as a free fire zone,” Shakir said. “The protections against indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks not only continue to apply, but actually are heightened at a hospital because even what may seem like a relatively minor attack can have life-altering consequences for patients who are being treated there, as well as for the medical workers that are providing lifesaving care to patients,” he said. International humanitarian law also requires that Israel provide safe evacuation for civilians in the area. IDF spokesperson Hagari said in a statement that the military had opened a humanitarian corridor at the Nasser Hospital, but reports have indicated that people have been blocked from leaving the premises, with some coming under attack when they tried to flee. “The Israeli government has consistently failed to provide a safe passage,” Shakir said. “They made these promises, over and over again, with evacuations from Northern Gaza from other hospitals. And consistently there have been well-documented reports of people being killed in airstrikes in purportedly safe zones. So these statements need to be read with a high degree of skepticism.” The IDF also led raids on the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City and the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza in December, the Ibn Sina Hospital in the West Bank town of Jenin in January, and others. And it has been accused of targeting ambulances and of conducting shelling near hospitals . Human Rights Watch has called for some of these “repeated, apparently unlawful attacks on medical facilities, personnel, and transport” to be investigated as war crimes . As Israel has made Gaza uninhabitable , hospitals have been the last safe place for civilians to shelter, even while facing a critical shortage of medical supplies. For those still trapped inside Nasser Hospital, that is no longer the case. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","In remarks following a mass shooting at the Chiefs Super Bowl parade, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas made a pointed statement about how the tragedy was able to take place even with more than 800 police officers stationed at the parade to secure the area. “That’s what happens with guns,” he said plainly. At least one person was killed in the violence and 21 people — including 11 children — were injured. As of Thursday, police had detained three people and confiscated multiple firearms in connection with the shooting, which they attributed to an interpersonal dispute. “Parades, rallies, schools, movies, it seems like almost nothing is safe,” Lucas added. According to reports , the violence began as an argument and escalated. It was not a single-shooter targeted attack like the kind that often receives more media attention. That makes it more in line with the vast majority of shooting incidents in the US . Lucas’s statements highlight the fact that the proliferation of guns and weak gun control policies have fueled the United States’s mass shooting crisis, including the latest instance of violence in Kansas City. They also explicitly acknowledge the fallacy of the “good guy with a gun” argument: the idea that adding armed security — rather than limiting access to guns — can keep people safe. The US has problems with gun violence because it has a lot of guns The US is unique among industrialized countries when it comes to the frequency of fatal gun violence . According to CNN, which referenced the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), a University of Washington global health research group, the proportion of homicides caused by gun violence in the US was 18 times that of the average of other developed countries in 2019. Similarly, the number of firearms people own in the US far surpasses that of any other developed country. The US has about 120 firearms per 100 residents, much higher than Yemen, the next closest country, which has about 53 firearms per 100 residents, according to a 2018 study by the Swiss-based gun research project the Small Arms Survey. As Vox has explained , multiple studies have directly linked the country’s number of firearms with the frequency of gun violence. “One 2013 Boston University-led study, for instance , found that for each percentage point increase in gun ownership at the household level, the state firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9 percent,” my colleagues Nicole Narea, Ian Millhiser, and I wrote. “And states with weaker gun laws have higher rates of gun-related homicides and suicides, according to a study by the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.” The impact of gun violence has already been evident this year. In the first month and a half of 2024, 1,639 Americans have been killed by firearms and 2,223 have been injured, according to data collected by the Gun Violence Archive , a not-for- profit group that tracks US shootings. In response to shootings, gun advocates often argue that more guns are the answer, that having a so-called “good guy with a gun” helps as they can stop a “bad guy with a gun.” That argument was advanced by gun advocates following a recent church shooting in Houston, in which off-duty officers shot and killed the suspected shooter. And it’s a myth directly peddled by the gun lobby: “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” former National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre previously said . As Lucas noted, however, despite the strong presence of armed security and law enforcement at the Chiefs parade, the shooting still occurred and resulted in injuries and a fatality. “We had over 800 officers there, staffed, situated all around Union Station today. We had security in any number of places, eyes on top of buildings and beyond — and there still is a risk to people,” Lucas said. That’s not to say law enforcement and civilians didn’t help prevent the situation from being worse: Bystanders assisted in subduing one suspect, per reports , and police arrested at least one individual as well. Research has shown that increasing the presence of “good guys with guns” is not a fully effective way to reduce gun violence. This is because police often aren’t able to respond in time and the attack has already occurred when they’re able to react. Per a Texas State University study , police were able to stop less than a third of active attacks — including shootings — between 2000 and 2022. Lucas’s statements and the circumstances in Kansas City ultimately underscore a grim reality: A central problem in these shootings is the guns themselves. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","The Israel-Palestine conflict goes back decades, but this latest war has taken an unprecedented toll in terms of the number of people killed , and represents a significant step back from any hopes of securing a two-state solution and a permanent peace. Vox podcasts are covering the conflict in depth, offering our listeners context and clarity about the history of the conflict, a deeper understanding of the players in Israel and Palestine and on the world stage, and the toll of Hamas’s attack and Israel’s retaliation on the people in the region. Today, Explained , Vox’s daily news explainer podcast, has been covering the conflict since it began, with an episode posted right after Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel that took the lives of around 1,200 people and resulted in the kidnapping of an estimated 240 hostages. The show has since continued to cover many threads in this story, from where Hamas comes from to how false information about the conflict has spread on social media and how information warfare is used in the Middle East. Vox podcasts The Weeds and The Gray Area have also been covering the unfolding crisis, its stakes, and its impact. You can find those and all our other episodes on the topic below; we’ll continue to add more as new episodes are published.

A Jew and a Muslim get honest about Israel and Gaza November 13, 2023 | Zack Beauchamp , a Vox senior correspondent who writes about democracy and Israel, speaks with Shadi Hamid, a columnist at the Washington Post, research professor of Islamic studies at Fuller Seminary, and author of The Problem of Democracy: America, the Middle East, and the Rise and Fall of an Idea . They discuss the October 7 attack, the subsequent war in Gaza, what it means for Israelis and Palestinians, and how Jews and Muslims in the United States can find common ground amid their communities’ grief. This conversation was recorded on November 2, 2023. BDS and the history of the boycott November 8, 2023 | If you turn on the news or scroll through your social media feed of choice, there’s a good chance you’ll see the latest on the Israel-Hamas war — and the reaction to it. But there’s one call to action making its way down social media feeds that feels different from all these other responses. It’s called BDS, short for boycott, divest, and sanction . And like just about everything related to this conflict, it’s complicated and controversial. The Weeds host Jonquilyn Hill sits down with Vox senior reporter Whizy Kim to explain the controversial movement, and with Cornell professor and author of Buying Power: A History of Consumer Activism in America Lawrence B.

Joel Beinin, Middle East history professor emeritus at Stanford, has answers. Hearts, minds, and likes October 23, 2023 | False information about what is happening in Israel and Gaza is taking over social media faster than journalists like BBC Verify’s Shayan Sardarizadeh can check it. That’s exactly how digital propagandists want it, says professor and social media expert Marc Owen Jones. Biden goes to Israel October 18, 2023 | It’s been 11 days since Hamas attacked Israel, killing civilians and taking hostages. Israel’s retaliation has killed hundreds of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment Aaron David Miller and Middle East analyst Michael Wahid Hanna explain what role diplomacy will play in the coming days. How Palestinians view Hamas October 16, 2023 | The US along with Israel and many of its allies have long considered Hamas a terrorist group.

"1","I don’t know about you, but I’m all worn out with this GOAT thing. Every category has a greatest of all time. And while it makes for pregnant discussion, it does get a little exhausting arguing whether Michael Jordan or LeBron James is the GOAT of pro basketball. Whether Tom Brady earns such a monicker, or if the designation should go to Joe Montana or, now, after his Super Bowl LVIII triumph, Patrick Mahomes. And then, a couple of weeks ago, two GOAT football coaches left their jobs on the same day, Nick Saban and Bill Belichick — one voluntarily, the other not — and everything in the media was GOAT, GOAT, GOAT — all GOAT all the time. READ MORE from Tom Raabe: Nick Saban Hangs Up His Straw Hat As I said … exhausting. I think it’s time to give a different category a little exposure — the WOAT (worst of all time). This is a more restrictive discussion, because we must choose a category in which participants are limited. You could not really acclaim any single major league baseball player as the worst of all time because the pool of qualified candidates numbers in the thousands. You might get away with designating the worst NFL quarterback of all time, but even then, the contenders are legion, some of whom are unknown even to the cognoscenti. For every Ryan Leaf, there might be a truly el-stinko backup QB for the 1947 Chicago Cardinals whose name everybody has forgotten. No, the category has to be pretty narrow. The Supreme Court might be fertile ground, as the number of justices is limited, but apart from legal scholars, who can name any justices from, say, the 1870s? Vice presidents? Possibly, but it’s difficult to tell which is good or bad, much less the worst, as they don’t do anything to begin with. And besides, it’s impossible to totally obliterate recency bias in that contest (Kamala would win in a landslide). Senators? You’d have a 500-way tie for first place. On this Presidents Day weekend, as we honor our chief executives of past and present, the only category that makes sense is president of the United States. There are, after all, only 45 of them. We can eliminate certain presidents who so briefly held office as to be more forgettable than awful. Zachary Taylor was in office for a mere year and a half, which was a lifetime compared to the tenures of William Henry Harrison (he delivered the longest inaugural address in history, only to serve the shortest period of time in office, 31 days) and James Garfield (199 days). So, the rule is that they must have served one full term to be WOAT-eligible. That eliminates a number of attractive candidates, like Warren Harding, Millard Fillmore, Chester Arthur, and John Tyler. It also technically cuts out Andrew Johnson, but he accomplished so much bad in his less-than-one full term that we’re allowing his inclusion. While it would be plausible simply to list the presidents serving in near proximity to the Civil War and leave it at that, a more expansive and nuanced view of the office is required. And while he will probably blow away the field once he’s eligible, it seems unfair to include in the list the current president. He has nine months to pad his resumé — and his lead in WOAT-ness — but, as a work in progress, or regress, he gets a pass. With that in mind, we turn to the nominees: Franklin Pierce: One of a number of pre–Civil War compromisers, Pierce was passionate about adding new slave states to the Union and also signed into law the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which allowed residents of new states to decide whether to allow slavery, and the Fugitive Slave Act. Although from New Hampshire, he was a Jackson Democrat who even proposed at one point annexing Cuba as another slave state. Even while enlisting a pretty good author to write his campaign bio — his buddy Nathaniel Hawthorne — he failed to be renominated by his party for the 1856 race. Jimmy Carter: It says something about one’s presidency when one is called the best ex-president of history. From killer rabbits to Billy Beer, from his “crisis in confidence” speech — known as the malaise speech — to the Iran embassy crisis and the aborted desert rescue, the presidency of the man from Plains was marked with risibility and retreat. Andrew Johnson: On the plus side, while president, the Tennessean did resist fellow Southerners who tried to undo the results of the Civil War. Also, after leaving office, Johnson broke the political mold by showing humility and returning to public life in a lesser capacity (like John Quincy Adams) by serving in the U.S. Senate. But he was a political oaf and made numerous tone-deaf mistakes, showing indifference to the plight of newly emancipated blacks to the point of opposing the 14th Amendment. Plus, he was impeached — which is, contrary to some current spin, still a bad thing — and survived removal by all of one vote. Seems to have been not very popular with his peers. Lyndon B. Johnson: Another of the Johnson boys, Lyndon did as much damage internationally as he did domestically. Ike gave us steadiness; JFK gave us Camelot; LBJ ratcheted up Vietnam to its height. As Bill Murray said in Stripes , when it comes to war, we’re 10 and one, and LBJ is pretty much responsible for the one. He also followed up the New Deal with the Great Society, which nobody thinks is so great anymore. James Buchanan: History has not been kind to James Buchanan, as close to a consensus No. 1 pick as you can get. Think of him as a gopher ball served up to Abraham Lincoln; he is the Ray McLean to Lincoln’s Vince Lombardi, the Mike Shula to Lincoln’s Nick Saban. Even before becoming president in 1856, he was a tergiversator with no equal, supporting measures that perpetuated North–South division, like the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and, in his inaugural address, encouraging the Dred Scott decision. Once in office, his hands went perpetually numb from his sitting on them. Barack Obama: No such list would be complete without the president who vowed to “fundamentally change America” even though most of America pretty much liked America the way it was. As an African American, he also had the opportunity to heal — or at least radically improve — race relations in America but opted to play the same old racial grievance game. So, who is your WOAT? Vote in the comments below; write-in candidates are acceptable."
"1","L ate last year, Congress extended Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and, in doing so, secured “the nation’s warrantless surveillance powers” until April 2024. With that month fast approaching, House Republicans have unveiled a new package to reauthorize those same powers, within limits. RELATED from Lloyd Billingsley: Christmas Comes Early for Government Snoops As the Hill reports , the new package “focus[es] on more reforms at the FBI to address misuse of the powerful spy tool,” but the deal does not include requirements for a warrant, which is “deemed a red line for the intelligence community but nonetheless a top priority for privacy advocates in Congress.” The new measure “would severely limit the number of FBI personnel who can query the database, forcing more oversight from some 550 supervisors or lawyers before agents can tap into the database to gain information on Americans.” The bill aims to “protect members of Congress or other high-profile officials” by requiring consent before a “defensive briefing.” The FBI will be required to “notify a member of Congress, with some limitation, if they have been queried in the 702 database.” As members of Congress and the public may have noticed, the FBI, tasked with counterintelligence, has become a law unto itself. Last August, an FBI squad gunned down Craig Robertson, a 75-year-old woodworker , for things he had allegedly posted online. The killing was reportedly under review by the FBI’s Inspection Division , but as of this writing there has been no investigation by Congress. As members may have noted, the FBI now operates along partisan lines. As Newsweek headlined last Oct. 4, “ Donald Trump Followers Targeted by FBI as 2024 Election Nears .” According to the report, the FBI has “quietly created a new category of extremists that it seeks to track and counter: Donald Trump’s army of MAGA followers.” A “senior FBI official” told Newsweek : “We cannot and do not investigate ideology. We focus on individuals who commit or intend to commit violence or criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security.” The people have cause to wonder. The FBI failed to stop the 1993 bomb attack on the World Trade Center, the massive terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, the terrorist mass murders at Fort Hood in 2009, the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, and terrorist mass murders in San Bernardino in 2015 and Orlando in 2016, with 49 dead. On the other hand, the FBI surveilled and harassed such dangerous criminals as singer Aretha Franklin and actress Jean Seberg . While assessing the FBI, members of Congress might read Neutering the CIA: Why US Intelligence versus Trump Has Long-Term Consequences . Former CIA analyst John A. Gentry charts a woke agency now deployed against “another serious candidacy by Trump,” with units ready for reactivation “if even a traditional Republican again becomes president.” This from an agency tasked with providing intelligence on foreign adversaries. As Gentry notes, the entire “Intelligence Community” failed to prevent the attack of Sept. 11, 2001, and for this failure was rewarded with bigger budgets. With the secretive IC now active in domestic politics, massive failures become more likely, with many innocent lives at stake. The CIA, like the FBI, has become a law unto itself. The real question for federal lawmakers is whether the CIA and FBI are even reformable, and how the people’s representatives might hold them accountable. Instead they seek to prolong surveillance measures that, as critics rightly contend, have no place in a free and democratic society. Members of Congress get special protections, but so far there’s no word about safeguards against warrantless surveillance for pro-life activists , protesting parents , and devout Catholics — all regarded as dangerous extremists by the current FBI. Journalists, especially those who are critical of the bureau, also have cause for concern. They can take it as a sign that Big Brother is watching, as George Orwell wrote in 1984 — or, in the style of Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca , here’s still looking at you, kid . Lloyd Billingsley is a policy fellow at the Independent Institute in Oakland, California."
"1","Editor’s Note: This is the second installment of Scott McKay’s new novel, King of the Jungle , which is being released exclusively at The American Spectator in 10 episodes each weekend in February, March, and early April, before its full publication on Amazon later this spring. In the first two episodes, available here and here , our narrator, journalist Mike Holman, has traveled to a surprisingly lavish little city under construction in the jungles of Guyana that his old college roommate, billionaire industrialist Pierce Polk, is building as a retreat from a world slowly going insane. Polk is confident that rumblings of a Venezuelan invasion of his jungle paradise are unfounded. April 16, 2024, Atlanta, Georgia “Hello America, and welcome to Episode 334 of Connected, With Mike Holman . In this edition of the podcast, we’ve got one of the most interesting people in the world, talking about things of interest to the world. Pierce Polk, CEO of Sentinel Holdings, has just announced plans to launch a wireless internet consumer service early next year with coverage all over North America, and no sooner was that announcement made but the opposition spiked immediately. Calls for an investigation into Sentinel issued forth from several quarters, including the Department of Justice. A letter from Garrick Wreath, the attorney general, claims that Sentinel is engaging in “hegemonic” business practices and decries the “dangerous trend” of “hyper- vertical integration” that Sentinel’s plan represents. “But that’s not all which is happening in the world of Sentinel Holdings. The FBI announced an investigation into Sentinel Port Management, alleging in leaked documents that its operations in Victoria, Texas and Hueneme, California are fronts for the global drug trade. Mr. Polk has denied this, and he has offered $100,000 to anyone who can provide definitive proof that drug trafficking is ongoing with participation of assent of Sentinel employees at any of the company’s 31 U.S. facilities. READ the first episode: Distant Rumblings of Danger: King of the Jungle “Legacy corporate media outlets are now calling Pierce Polk an ‘embattled’ CEO. But if he’s embattled, he’s battling. He’s got a lot to say and a clear desire to say it, so it’s a pleasure to welcome to the show Mr. Pierce Polk. Pierce, thanks for stopping in. Which one of these kerfuffles do you want to start with?” Pierce gave me a perturbed look, not that I cared. I’d told him that the podcast wasn’t the best idea and that I wasn’t going to use my show as a vehicle to give him a hummer. I made it clear, or at least I thought I did, that if he was coming on the show, I wouldn’t be hostile — but I also wasn’t going to bury him in cream puffs, either. The thing was, we didn’t do much show-prep. He just told me that he thought it would be a good idea if we did a podcast to talk about the things Sentinel had going on that were in the news. I went into the podcast largely blind as to what he had to say, which pissed me off. I’m big on preparation, and I’m in control of my show. That’s how I work. All of a sudden, I was part of Pierce’s cult, like I’d been afraid of, and I was reduced to the status of a spectator, essentially, on my own program. Obviously, the guy you interview is going to drive the conversation a little. This was going to be more than that. So yeah — I waylaid him with the open. Tough shit if you don’t like that, Pierce. And when he saw that I didn’t melt from the stink-eye he gave me, Pierce immediately snapped out of his irritation and went into Charming Cult-Leader mode. “Mike, it’s a great pleasure to be with you, and let me say that America desperately needs more Mike Holmans who actually do their jobs in media. The legacy press that you referenced is full of political operatives disguised as reporters, and most of them don’t even know what journalism is. So, thank you for what you do.” “Appreciated, sir. Is there any truth to the allegations about the ports?” “No. in fact, we’re going to release, as soon as we can and as soon as some legal protections are established for the sources of our information, several documents which prove the origin of this so-called investigation. It didn’t come from FBI field offices in Texas or California or anywhere else, and not even from the FBI at all. Instead, it came from the White House.” “Well, that’s an allegation.” “You bet it is. And it’s by no means all I’ve got. Mike, you’ve reported on your show and website for several years just how radical and corrupt this government is, and you’ve inspired me to do my own work. We at Sentinel have been in the network and private security business for a long time and as such we have investigative resources of our own. We’ve begun to marshal those and look into corruption at the highest levels on down, and today will be the first of many disclosures that will shock the American public.” “It seems like this might be one of our most- watched episodes.” “I would hope so, because the American people really need to know just how bad things are.” “Before we get to that, we should talk about the wireless internet project and the Deadhorse administration’s threats to that business expansion. What about Attorney General Wreath’s letter?” “I was amazed to see that, Mike. After all, this attorney general and this administration, and the previous one of the same party that this administration is the rump end of, had absolutely no problem with one Big Tech company after another vertically integrating themselves. Or horizontally integrating, which is even worse. They allowed Silicon Valley to turn into a very tight oligarchy, especially in the consumer marketplace, and they’ve done nothing as the cable companies and cell providers have built, essentially, monopolies in all the markets in America for internet service. “So along we come — and by the way, this would really be our first foray into the consumer market for anything, because most of what we do has always been business-to- business — and now he’s concerned. Why? Because Garrick Wreath made millions of dollars doing work as a lawyer and lobbyist for the cell phone companies, owns a whole lot of stock in two of them…” “Yes, but that stock is held in a blind trust,” I interjected, trying to keep it fair. Wreath, like all of the political hacks in this administration and lots of others, hid behind that cover story as they profiteered from their positions. But on this one, I knew what was coming. I was like John Stockton feeding Karl Malone for a one-hand jam. “Oh, right. A blind trust. And the administrator of that trust is Excelsior Capital Management, the CEO of which is Keith Bradbury, who is Wreath’s brother-in-law.” “Whoops!” I said. “Right, exactly. Whoops. Here’s the problem with Garrick Wreath, and it’s a lot worse than his crooked attacks on our proposed expansion. We’ve been looking into something that had gotten a lot of viral traffic on social media, at least for a little while before it was suppressed on Facebook and YouTube and a few other places. Namely, that there’s a ring of child predators operating in New York and DC who engage in human trafficking and sex slavery.” “But those allegations were supposedly debunked.” “Were they? There were elements of them which were clearly untrue, but the ‘debunking’ was more like suppression and hope they would go away. Well, our team decided to do some real digging, and that’s when we found a 14-year-old named, well, I’ll call him Pedro.” “This is something new.” “Yes, it is, Mike. Pedro comes from a country in Central America, and he was trafficked across the border as an 11-year-old. First year of the current administration, when the border was thrown open. The coyotes took him to Piedras Negras in Mexico, across the river from Eagle Pass, Texas, and sent him to cross the Rio Grande into the hands of the border patrol. And from there, our own government transported him to ‘relatives’ who lived in Hyattsville, Maryland.” “I take it those relatives weren’t really relatives,” I said. “No, Mike, they weren’t. Instead, these were people working for the Mexican cartels who handled kids being trafficked. And in Pedro’s case he was taken to a house in Bethesda, Maryland, where he was then abused in ways I won’t describe by people who, he says, paid a lot of money for that sick privilege.” “That’s awful.” “Yes, it is. And a couple of weeks ago Pedro managed to escape from that house and by a spot of luck he saw a flyer our team put up on a telephone pole giving a number that runaways and kids being trafficked could call for help. That’s part of Operation Lifeline, a nonprofit we founded a few years ago which has delivered hundreds of kids who’ve been trafficked back to their families all over the world.” The website and phone number for Operation Lifeline appeared on the bottom of the screen. “Anyway, Pedro called the number and said he’d been held by bad people and he was afraid to call the police because he believed the cops were compromised, and he asked if we could help him. So we did. And Pedro identified the house in Bethesda where he’d been subjected to the most disgusting abuse known to man.” “I haven’t heard about a raid on that house or any arrests made in the legacy media.” “Neither have I, which is one reason I’m here. While we were waiting for the FBI or state or local police to do something about that house and what was happening there, we had a crew surveilling it from the street and overhead. And we watched as it was cleared out of all the people and stuff that was in there.” “That’s disconcerting.” “What’s more disconcerting is that we looked into the ownership of that house. We thought it was unusual that the house was owned by a small real estate investment trust, a company with a very uncommon investment profile. All it owns is large single-family houses in declining neighborhoods of cities around the country, places with six and seven bedrooms, lots of trees on the property, and garages. Always garages.” “Potential houses of ill repute, you’re saying?” “I’m not sure what I’m saying … just yet. We’re investigating dozens of these places, but we’re trying not to burn the evidence like we might have done in Bethesda.” “But I take it you do have something on that REIT.” “I do. It’s a privately held entity, but among the listed investors in the initial paperwork filed with the state of Delaware 17 years ago is … one Garrick Wreath, now Attorney General of the United States of America.” That wasn’t all Polk had to say. He then said he had written proof that the Vice President had taken a bribe from a Mexican cartel kingpin, and that the Federal Reserve was deliberately devaluing the currency. Then at the end of the podcast he made a confession — that Sentinel’s announced move into consumer wifi was a bluff to smoke out Wreath. READ the second episode: An Unexpected Paradise: King of the Jungle “We have the capability to offer that service,” he said, “but we’re not doing it yet. We need an entirely different regulatory environment so that a company like ours could compete in a free market rather than this rigged system we’re currently in. But when we do enter that market, we’ll cut people’s monthly internet service costs by 50 percent. “But I do thank the Attorney General for taking the bait. He can’t say that I started this fight. That’s on him, not me. He should know that he’s not beating me, though, not when he’s coming from so weak a position as he is.” No sooner was the show uploaded to YouTube but it immediately came down. It didn’t matter. That podcast set a record for downloads on Rumble, and within two days it was over 100 million views on X, a number that had doubled a week later. Congress called for hearings, the police raided that house in Bethesda and found nothing, of course, there was a smattering of calls for Wreath’s resignation in the legacy media. Conservative media went ballistic, as it often does, but anyone who was looking for this to provide some collapse within the administration was going to be disappointed. Four days later Joe Deadhorse’s approval rating in a new national poll ticked down from 37 percent to 35. And the day after that, the FBI, NYPD and the New York State Police raided the corporate headquarters of Sentinel Port Management in Manhattan’s Upper West Side, pursuant to separate warrants issued by judges from the Southern District of New York and The Criminal Court of the City of New York. They found the offices empty. April 19, 2024, Los Claritas, Bolivar, Venezuela “Here they come,” said Xing, from behind his binoculars. “It’s certainly about time,” said Carvajal, who Cabrillo had noticed was less and less successful in his efforts to hide his contempt for the Chinese emissary. This was a failing of the diminutive major, Cabrillo was aware, but on the other hand he couldn’t quite fault Carvajal’s dismay at their situation. Their effort at preparation for an invasion of the wilderness to the east was increasingly dependent on foreign assets. The Chinese were suddenly everywhere in Venezuela. This was something the Madiera regime had resisted for years, while other countries were embracing things like the Belt and Road Initiative and other “cooperative agreements” with the Chinese Communist Party. Cabrillo had seen what China could do. Would do. There would be investment. The Chinese would send in engineers and workers, and they would open a mine or a quarry or some other facility drawing raw materials from the earth. Here and there, the local citizenry might make a few dollars, pesos or dinars off the trade, but in the main, those materials — the lithium, the diamonds, the oil, the cobalt, etc. — would make their way onto ships bound for Shanghai or Quanzhou where their products would be turned into all kinds of consumer goods. Or weapons. Or whatever. Cabrillo didn’t pretend to know much of commerce. He was a military man, as three generations of his family before him had been. His father had been a colonel in the Castro regime and had fought for la revolucion in Angola and Nicaragua, which had earned him a villa near the beach in Playa Larga. And his grandfather had been a general — but not for Castro, at least not initially. The old man had been with Bautista and had fought against the communists. He stayed until the end and was captured. After three years in the prisons, several times nearly personally executed by Che Guevara, Eladio Jorge Cabrillo had been brought to see Fidel Castro himself, who made him an offer he couldn’t refuse. “You will join us,” Castro said, “and you will see your wife alive. If you do not, you will see her die. And your children, too.” Eladio had then agreed to rejoin the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, which is what the regime was then calling the Cuban army. He was never treated without suspicion, but the Castros found themselves with so few competent military commanders that they tolerated Eladio nonetheless. And eventually, the Cabrillos became communists. Manuel was a communist, but as he would joke among his friends, he wasn’t very good at it. Manuel actually liked the idea of private property, and when he wasn’t here in Venezuela commanding a brigade of peasants and Amerindians, he was busily burnishing his “bug-out bag,” as the Americans called it. Or as best he could, given his less-than-perfect command of the free market system. His wife Esmerelda, who he’d brought to Venezuela from Havana and stashed in an apartment in a well-secured area of Maracaibo, was a much more accomplished entrepreneur. She managed his properties. There were apartment buildings, sugar plantations, a small shipping company which did a brisk little business moving certain agricultural products from the Colombian hinterlands to Merida, on their way north, and a few other investments, most of which were managed out of a financial institution in the Cayman Islands. It was cheap to conduct business in Venezuela, if you had the right stroke within the regime. Which Cabrillo did. But Madiera was putting much of that at risk with his foreign ambitions. It wasn’t that the mission Cabrillo was training the men for was particularly problematic. The Guyanese had no military to speak of; their official force strength was just under five thousand men. Cabrillo had that many in his brigade alone, and there were two others just like it in the Venezuelan army’s Jungle Infantry Division. He didn’t know if the others were any better prepared for offensive action than his was, and frankly, he wasn’t all that confident in the 53 rd . But against a lightly populated nation of farmers, miners and fishermen, most of whom barely had pistols and other small arms much less any real military hardware? This was not a difficult mission. They would conquer the area to the west of the Essequibo River, which the Venezuelans had claimed as their own for hundreds of years. The Madiera government had renewed an old complaint that in 1899, when the border between the two countries had been settled by a commission of British, American and Russian diplomats, with the Americans representing the Venezuelans owing to a lack of diplomatic relations between Venezuela and the UK at the time, what resulted was a corrupt bargain due to an American sellout. Cabrillo figured that argument was probably correct. His experience and indoctrination had it that the U.S.A. was always engaged in some manner or other of depriving the people of Latin America of their due. But he also knew that most of the world wasn’t all that interested in the claims of the Madiera regime of Venezuela. And when the regime, the previous December, had staged a national referendum on annexing Essequibo pursuant to its age-old complaint, the planning of the Jungle Infantry’s mission had begun, which led Cabrillo to Las Claritas. Given no outside interference, that mission was clearly destined to succeed. And while Cabrillo’s assessment of the American administration, headed — at least nominally — by the deranged old man Joe Deadhorse, was that it was utterly paralyzed by a lack of leadership or even any conviction over its own national interests, he was nonetheless a bit worried that their adventure to the east would bring the Americans into a war. And if the Americans came into the theater, he’d need an elite force just to survive. Which he most certainly did not have. He knew he was right to be worried about that. Carvajal was more than worried. He wouldn’t shut up about it. Cabrillo had told him to stop his whining several times, but the little major had confined his complaints to their private conversations and never expressed doubts about the mission to the men. Like always, he’d stopped short of conduct Cabrillo could justifiably discipline; he had to give his adjutant room to privately express his judgment, or else he would be closing off a potential source of information and good advice. And while he didn’t welcome Carvajal’s doubt-casting, none of it was ill-founded. The Guyanese they would sweep aside easily; any other force in their path, whether it was American, British (a possibility), Jamaicans or Dominicans if the Caribbean defense organization CARICOM got involved, or whoever else, and things could grow problematic very quickly. Cabrillo found himself praying — a relic of his family’s pre-communist heritage — that their mission didn’t bring them in conflict with the Americans or others. And if as to represent a sideways answer to those prayers, the Chinese continued to arrive with gifts for the 53 rd Jungle Infantry Brigade. Today, those gifts were to include two dozen Harbin Z-9 helicopters capable of transporting 10 soldiers each. Xing, the sweaty apparatchik who styled himself a military adviser though he appeared to be nothing of the sort and decked himself out in a trilby hat and a gray seersucker suit rather than fatigues, was cackling into his binoculars as the choppers noisily made their way into Las Claritas. “They’re nearly here. Aren’t they beautiful?” he exclaimed. “They’re fine,” said Carvajal, who was looking at the approaching choppers through his own binoculars. “These will put your men in position to secure town after town when the signal is given,” Xing beamed. “And then our cooperation may truly begin.” Cabrillo rolled his eyes. Three days before, there had been a food riot in El Dorado, about 45 minutes up the road to the north, and he’d had to send some of his men there to suppress it. Cabrillo knew that Venezuela was in no position to start a war with anyone. He also knew that the Chinese were perfectly well aware of that fact and happy to take advantage of it. Those Harbin Z-9’s were only part of the shower of military assistance the Chinese were dumping not just on the 53 rd but all the elements of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces. Cabrillo also knew that Xing wasn’t there so much to supervise that assistance but also to direct their progress when he saw fit to do so. Cabrillo had been informed of that very thing in a communique from headquarters. What he hadn’t been informed of was exactly who Xing was. Was he with the People’s Liberation Army? The Ministry of State Security? He didn’t think it was the latter. He’d thought to ask, but had stopped short. Cabrillo’s experience and training told him that curiosity was not a virtue. Xing was Xing. If the powers that be wanted him to know more, they’d tell him. He didn’t like any of it, but he couldn’t do anything about it. But something else troubled him. The 53rd was building up quite a store of ammunition and supplies while the locals found themselves more and more desperate. Cabrillo’s quartermasters were under orders to stock up on all manner of foodstuffs and other supplies which might be useful to sustain a military occupation of the Guyanese hinterlands to the east, but he knew that was inherently problematic when the locals were suffering deprivation. He expected that ultimately his men would be living off the land — and that meant living off the locals in ways that big stacks of Bolívar Soberanos, suspect value that those already carried, wouldn’t suffice to facilitate. There had already been incidents; three days before, some of the men had shot a cow which was loose in the jungle and brought the carcass back to the base for butchering — only to endure a lengthy harangue from a local farmer with what amounted to an angry posse armed with machetes, pitchforks and a few pistols standing behind him. It was a scenario which held the prospect of a major incident, not to mention a major setback in the training of his troops. Cabrillo, arriving quickly to the scene, had managed to placate the farmer with a stack of Bolivars and the promise of a new cow, which he was able to procure from a ranch in Brazil thanks to a regime contact in Caracas who had talents in such acquisitions. But it struck him that his men were the best-fed and certainly best-armed of all the occupants of this far southeast corner of Venezuela and the locals still showed up ready for blood if satisfaction wasn’t at hand. That wasn’t a good sign. He knew that, while he wasn’t in charge of the timeline, the best thing that could happen was to get orders sooner rather than later for moving his men out of Las Claritas and into Guyana. And for taking whatever they could off the people of Essequibo. Xing’s choppers landed, and Cabrillo halfheartedly participated in the ceremony which ensued thanking the Chinese for supplying such a gracious bounty. When it was over, he and Carvajal reconvened in the small trailer that was brigade headquarters. They found Xing already there, boots off, stretched out on the little couch watching the large flat-screen TV along the far wall. Xing had sneaked away while Cabrillo was attempting to communicate with the Chinese chopper pilots, who left in a bus after officially turning the helicopters over to Venezuelans from the Army Aviation Command’s helicopter battalion. Cabrillo had noticed that. Even before Carvajal had griped about it. He thought to upbraid Carvajal for his complaints, but again checked himself; while listening to his adjutant protest about Xing was unpleasant, it was nonetheless a reasonably accurate summation of their situation. “We’re an extension of the Chinese Army,” Carvajal groused quietly. “We’re an instrument of our country becoming their colony.” “Oh, stop moaning like an old woman,” Cabrillo said halfheartedly. “Without the Chinese we would be short of every necessity. Instead, we could support a force 30 percent greater than our present size.” “That might be true,” said Carvajal, “but the question is whether Venezuela actually profits from this operation, or does that honor go to our oriental friends?” “Excellent question,” Cabrillo said cheerfully. “Does it really matter at the end of the day? Your orders are still your orders.” Carvajal was starting to respond, but then he stopped himself. “What?” asked Cabrillo. “I think if the men are asked to brutalize the Guyanese, they will refuse,” he said. “Especially if they believe this is all for the benefit of Xing and his friends.” “Whose friends?” asked Xing, missing most of the conversation amid the TV show he was watching intently. “Nothing,” said Carvajal. “I’m very interested in the Z-9,” Cabrillo interjected, trying not to ruin Carvajal’s career. “What are you watching?” Carvajal blurted out as he noticed something disturbing on the screen Xing’s eyes were glued to. Cabrillo saw it as well and did a double take. “It’s SuperLolita,” said Xing. “The latest from our American friends.” Cabrillo had heard of the show. It was a controversial offering from the giant U.S. media conglomerate XYZ/Sidney which had appeared on its streaming platform SidneyAlso. SuperLolita was a comic book made into a TV series, though Cabrillo had no idea if it was ever actually a comic book. The gist of the show, as he understood it, was that the main character was an early teen Latino trans-woman street hooker with super powers who fought for social justice on behalf of the LGBTQIA+ community, the differently abled and the undocumented migrants of inner-city Houston. She, or at least it was Cabrillo’s understanding that SuperLolita was to be referred to as a she, had two super powers: the ability to hear conversations even through brick walls from 1000 yards away, and the ability to shoot deadly laser beams from her nipples. Glancing at the screen, Cabrillo saw that the latter power was real as SuperLolita pulled down her tube-top and let forth a pair of considerable beams of light which destroyed a police car. Xing bellowed a laugh, followed by several words of indecipherable Mandarin. “Why would you be interested in this filth?” Carvajal asked the Chinese emissary. “To watch the Americans destroy their own culture without help?” Xing responded. “How can you not be entertained?” Carvajal looked at Cabrillo. “He isn’t wrong,” Cabrillo said. “You don’t find it depressing?” “I have nothing to do with it. If they want to destroy themselves, it isn’t my problem. The mission is.” Xing was cackling loudly as SuperLolita was climbing on top of a burly white policeman as he crawled away from the burning cruiser. “You gonna learn to respect the new trans matriarchy, sugar,” she was telling the terrified cop. “Yes, ma’am,” the suddenly subservient cop said, as SuperLolita took his handcuffs from his belt and clasped them around his wrists. “This is filth,” Carvajal said. “I don’t understand the casting,” Cabrillo noted. “What’s wrong with it?” asked Xing. “First, the actress is not a Latina.” “Amy Nguyen is excellent,” Xing said. “She’s very popular in China. Half-black, half-Vietnamese. Very exotic.” “And a man,” Carvajal said. “She has a beard.” “Enough of this,” said Cabrillo. “It’s time to go over the order of deployment so that we can calibrate the mission preparations.” Xing sighed and pressed the “pause” button on the remote control just as SuperLolita was crushing the policeman’s hand under a spike heel. “Fine,” he said. “Let’s go over this again.” A map of southeastern Venezuela and central Essequibo, the area of the 53 rd ’s planned operations, was laid out on a cheap card table. Cabrillo approached it with Carvajal and Xing in tow. “Now,” he said, “the first wave will go out as follows: nine helicopters straight to Kaietur Falls, and three each to capture the towns of Ekereku, Paruima Mission, Waramadan, Opadai, and Kamuda Village.” “Yes,” said Xing, a mild exasperation in his voice, “we’ve been over this.” “And then we will be joined by a second wave of helicopters, so that we will then send 10 of them to the next target, which is Mahdia, plus two each to the secondary targets Ajimpepai, Kwiokrebaru, Isseneru Village, Assura Village, Pipillapai, Opadai and Kokadai.” “These places are so small it’s hardly worth it to spend the gas,” Xing muttered. Cabrillo gave him a sideways look, irritated that the interloper would carp about his plan. If executed correctly he would effectively occupy what points of communication and transportation existed in his area of operation within a couple of hours of the opening of hostilities. And what did Xing know about it? “And then the major target,” said Carvajal. “That’s correct,” Cabrillo said, looking defiantly at their Chinese guest. “The American settlement at Liberty Point.” April 27, 2024: New York, New York I was in Manhattan for a meeting with ClearHeart Broadcasting, a big corporate radio company that I’d flirted with for years over the idea of doing a daily syndicated radio show, when one of their suits stormed into the conference room. “You guys have to see this! Turn on ANN!” So we did, and there was a breaking news report about a massive cyberattack that had taken down the servers for all of New York’s state government and for New York City as well. Both of them had made a large show of firing Sentinel Security as their firewall provider in what was essentially a political retaliation for Pierce evacuating the company headquarters. But they obviously hadn’t done much preparation for the change, and the guy who’d been in charge of the New York state server had made a very public resignation. It was gorgeous, actually. What he’d said was that DEI and wokeness doesn’t build a bridge, fly a plane or run a firewall, and he’d put up with a lot over the last few years, but he’d never seen anything like the attempt to cancel Sentinel over politics. His name was Aidan Park Hoo, and we had him on the Connected podcast the next day. He was a geek’s geek, but a hell of an interview. When I asked him what he was going to do next, he said he was thinking about buying a cabin in the hills. “There’s a lot of that going around,” I said. “Well, yeah. Just pay attention! Lunatics are running everything. And they definitely don’t listen to advice. All you can do is try to get away from them.” That same day, Deadhorse gave a speech at an assisted living facility in Arizona where he’d attempted to attack Pierce as an outlaw, but he ran off script and got him confused with Ross Perot. That after letting it slip that the Justice Department had been “secretly investigating” Sentinel for months. It was awful and hilarious at the same time, but the upshot of it was that before the end of the news cycle the New York state legislature passed a bunch of changes to its criminal fraud statute that were clearly aimed at Pierce. That night the cable news shows were full of lawyers arguing over what the state legislature in New York had done. The public hadn’t heard terms like “bill of attainder” and “ex post facto law” in a long time, but that had changed. Pierce sent me a text message letting me know that there would be a big party in Georgetown soon. I knew he meant the one in Guyana, not the one in DC. And the meeting with ClearHeart was largely a waste of time. The thing was, I didn’t really want to deal with all the time a daily radio show would take up. Between the two hours in the evening ClearHeart was pitching, and the show prep time before that, it was going to be a monopolization of my schedule. But the big sticking point was that they were insisting on gobbling up the podcast for their own app, and that would have largely been the end of Holman Media. I would have considered it had I not done the deal with Pierce. In fact, the ClearHeart meeting was already scheduled when I made the deal with Pierce. But now that I had that deal and I was becoming the hottest thing in media — or something like that — I said I’d only consider it if there was a verifiable shit-ton of money on offer, and that had to be up-front money. It wasn’t. I had a cable network TV hit in a midtown studio that night, which was a debate with Juan Williams about the threat rogue billionaires presented. Williams blew a gasket at me when I noted that for all his complaints about Pierce, he’d never attempted to do anything damaging to the rest of us like pumping chemicals into the sky to deflect the sun’s rays, he wasn’t in the Epstein flight logs, he hadn’t tried to fix an election or censor anybody. “Well, you work for him,” said Williams, “so of course you’d say that.” “I’d say it regardless,” I shot back. “It’s the truth. Why aren’t you angry that a government full of political hacks is trying to destroy him simply for having a different opinion than you?” “He’s destroying the economy! He’s putting his competitors out of business!” “Really? Who? And how? And did you say this about Amazon and what they’ve done to Mom and Pop retail in America?” Williams didn’t like that. The debate got nasty, and the host cut to a commercial break early and the segment ended. Then as I was leaving the studio, I got a text from Kathleen Lemoine, Pierce’s personal assistant, letting me know a car was waiting to pick me up in the building’s garage and take me to Teterboro Airport where a jet was going to take me to Guyana. She said she’d have somebody check me out of my hotel and bring my bags. “OK,” I texted back. This was probably better than having to get up at 4 AM to catch that Delta flight back to Hartsfield the next day. I landed in Georgetown at 1 a.m. and a car was waiting for me at the airport. The guy driving it called himself Vinesh, and he spoke with an accent that sounded like he was from Calcutta. “Are you one of the newly-arrived?” I asked him as he wheeled around onto a two-lane road leading out of the airport. “No, sir,” said Vinesh. “My people have been here for two centuries.” “You’re kidding.” “Most of us in Guyana are descended from Indians brought here as indentured servants.” “I see.” “Most of the rest are of African descent. We were indentured to them.” “Wait, the Africans were the landholders and you guys worked in their fields?” “That’s correct.” “How about that?” “Now we run the country.” I just nodded. I had a feeling this was going to turn into a lecture of some kind. “Hey,” I said, “I heard your economy here grew like 60 percent last year. This place is booming, huh?” “It is. But you can’t really tell. You can make more money now, but everything has become very, very expensive. When it isn’t bought up immediately.” “I can imagine.” “Guyana was always one of the more reasonable places to live. But now there are Americans, British and the Latins, and they are buying up everything. Pricing us out.” “I would guess they’ll be putting up subdivisions and apartment buildings and so on.” “Pierce Polk already is. You know him?” “I do. He’s building things here in Georgetown?” Vinesh nodded. “Sentinel Construction is building a big place in Land of Canaan, which is south of Georgetown, for a headquarters. And they’re buying up land for, who knows?” “That sounds like him. Always ahead of the game. I hear he’s building a mall around here somewhere.” “I like him,” Vinesh said, nodding. “But he should stay in America, not have his jungle Shangri-la in Guyana.” “Why so?” “Because they will take it from him. It is too much, what he is trying to do.” “He’d be a little dismayed to hear you say that. But I expected you were going to give me a Guyana-for-the-Guyanese speech.” “No,” he said. “But this is South America. It isn’t like the United States where good things just naturally happen.” “I hate to tell you, Vinesh, but most people in the States don’t think that’s true of the States anymore either.” “I know. I have a nephew who lives in Baltimore.” “Yikes. Baltimore?” “The suburbs.” “Right.” Vinesh pulled us in front of a little boutique hotel along a big east-west drag of a road. The marquee said it was the Grand Coastal Hotel; it wasn’t all that grand, but it was tidy and had a little bit of a tropical-colonial vibe to it. Once I was inside, a friendly rotund lady gave me an actual metal key to a room with a king-sized bed, and I didn’t even undress before I crashed. The next morning when I checked my messages I saw that all hell had broken loose back home. At a press conference in Manhattan, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced he’d secured an indictment of Pierce Polk and “twenty of his confederates” on a RICO beef. I wasn’t sure what the details were, but my attention was really piqued when he said that it was important that Polk be arrested seeing as though he was a flight risk. Arrested? Guys like Pierce, you call his lawyer and negotiate a surrender. This clown was talking about sending feds out to get him like he was a drug dealer or a rapist. I texted Pierce then, asking what the hell was happening. The response was a question: are you in Georgetown? When I said yes, he told me to chill out and enjoy the pool, and he’d be down there later that day. Of course, the hotel carried ANN, and of course, they were breathlessly following the Pierce Polk saga. There was a special graphic flashing on the screen about the “NATIONAL MANHUNT” for the “rogue billionaire,” and a few minutes later there was a correspondent in Dallas reporting that the U.S. Marshals had him trapped at Sentinel’s offices in Addison. But the Texas Department of Public Safety was also on the scene and there was something of a standoff. Sentinel’s people were heavily armed and refusing to allow the Marshals into the building. And Texas DPS was siding with Sentinel and not the Marshals. There I was, texting Pierce asking what the hell was going on. “No big deal,” came the response. And ANN’s cameras caught a helicopter taking off from the roof of the building. “He’s escaping!” cried the reporter. “They’re letting him get away!” Melissa, my research assistant, called. “I think you should come home,” she said. “As much as I like him, do you really want to be associated with Pierce Polk now?” “I pretty much have to see this though at this point,” I said. “If nothing else it’s one of the biggest stories in modern journalism, don’t you think?” “Yeah. If they let you tell it.” “Hmmm.” “What are you doing down there?” “Right now? Answering emails in a hotel room. Maybe later I’ll go and hug a sloth.” “Smart-ass,” she said. “Be careful.” “Everything OK at the office?” “Yeah. Colby is ecstatic. Site traffic is through the sky today. We’re live-blogging the Pierce Polk manhunt like everybody else is.” “OK,” I said. “I have some sort of lunch meeting down here that I got a calendar invite for. I don’t know what it is.” “Again, be careful.” A little later on, there was a report that the Sentinel Holdings Gulfstream G700 jet was forced to land at Belle Chasse Naval Air Station south of New Orleans. Some press flack from DOJ was on TV bragging about how they were arresting Pierce. That was pretty impressive, I thought, considering that he was texting me with laughing emojis. “You OK?” I replied. “Fuckers got my jet,” came the response. “Where are you?” “I’ll be there in a couple of hours. We’re meeting with the PM.” So that was my lunch meeting. Vinesh brought the car to the front of the hotel, and now in the light of day we were following the main drag, which was the Rupert Craig Highway, westward into the downtown. “I think you might be stuck with our friend from now on,” I said. “Pierce Polk?” he asked. “Yeah. Seems like they tried to arrest him in the States today and he decided he’d relocate to your fine country instead.” Vinesh sighed and nodded. A little later on, he put us in front of another hotel. This was the Marriott, and it backed up to the beach. “Damn,” I said. “Wonder why they didn’t put me here.” “Because there’s no room,” said Vinesh. “It’s booked weeks out.” “Really?” “It’s like I told you. Everything is expensive when you can even get it. Too many people here now.” “Wow,” I said as I got out. “I will wait for you,” said Vinesh. Inside the hotel, a pretty black girl in a flowery pencil skirt met me and directed me to the presidential suite. She said her name was Mathilda and she was an assistant to the president — a guy by the name of Mahandas Ishgan. “Your boss is already in with him,” she said. “His flight got in early.”"
"1","“A cquiring kids” is Hollywood’s newest dystopian dream. Kristen Stewart, of the Twilight movie franchise fame, was recently featured on the February cover of Rolling Stone for an “uncensored” exclusive punctuated by frequent vulgarities and accompanied by vaguely pornographic images, including one of Stewart wearing a jockstrap . READ MORE: The Decline and Fall of Hollywoke The actress, who came out as lesbian in 2017 on Saturday Night Live and accepted her now- fiancée’s marriage proposal in 2021, made her “gayness” a central part of interview with Rolling Stone . “Now, I want to do the gayest f***ing thing you’ve ever seen in your life,” Stewart said . “If I could grow a little mustache, if I could grow a f***ing happy trail and unbutton my pants, I would.” She is also, she claims, ready to start a family. “I don’t know what my family’s going to look like, but there’s no f***ing way that I don’t start acquiring kids,” Stewart told the magazine. Stewart Pushes Gay Agenda Throughout the article , Stewart paints a picture of a life punctuated by trauma, insomnia, and deep anxiety, the latter of which eventually led to a brief hospital visit. Stewart has been direct about her sexuality since coming out, and Rolling Stone claims that her “openness … has likely been a model for others.” “My sexuality is totally fluid,” she described. This has seeped into her career as well, as Stewart spent years writing a screenplay for The Chronology of Water , a bisexual memoir by Lidia Yuknavitch. Rolling Stone describes the screenplay as “a cult favorite about female shame and female rage and female art and female-on-female BDSM.” According to Stewart, it’s “so taboo it’s almost horny.” She hasn’t yet raised the money to start filming. Stewart is also starring in the movie Love Lies Bleeding , a crime thriller featuring a lesbian “romance ” that is set to be released on March 8. Stewart told Rolling Stone the movie felt personal to her “in a way she hadn’t expected.” Sparking Outrage Stewart’s interview quickly sparked outrage on social media, with many on both sides of the political spectrum voicing concerns about her language on “acquiring” children. “Acquiring kids? With that attitude, maybe she should consider not doing that,” one user posted on X. SurrogacyConcern, a U.K.-based campaign focused on highlighting the negative impacts of surrogacy, pointed out the consumerist mindset behind Stewart’s statement, arguing that too many celebrities “think[] babies come like Amazon packages.” Stewart’s comments even caught the attention of high- profile conservative commentators like Ben Shapiro, who called her language “dystopian.” As expected, the mainstream media has been quick to jump to Stewart’s defense. Rolling Stone hit back with an article describing how “Right-Wingers Are Terrified of Our Gay Kristen Stewart Cover.” In the piece, the magazine called out Christopher Rufo for “deadnaming” the self-identified transgender man Elliot “Ellen” Page in his critique of the Stewart cover. It isn’t fear that drove the conservatives to lambast Stewart on X — they seem to be more concerned with how lightly Hollywood treats parenthood.

"1","I n a breaking story that will have serious international implications, we’re just learning from the Russians that dissident and opposition leader Alexei Navalny has died in Vladimir Putin’s gulag. Specifically, the 47-year-old Navalny perished in a brutal Arctic concentration camp called “Polar Wolf.” (Circa 1920, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky first used the words “concentration camp” to describe their new gulag system, well before Adolf Hitler used the term in Germany a decade later.) The death in the Polar Wolf penal colony conjures up so many victims’ names and images from the Russian past and present. Speaking of Lenin and Trotsky and their Bolsheviks, one thinks of their bayoneting of another Alexei — the young hemophiliac heir to the Romanov throne. The Bolsheviks murdered him and his sisters and entire family in their House of Special Designation in Yekaterinburg in July 1918. Thereafter, Lenin and his successor, Joseph Stalin, implemented the vast gulag system throughout Siberia. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the greatest of Soviet dissidents, who somehow managed to survive Siberia, called it The Gulag Archipelago in his classic book. Countless millions of innocents perished there. The late Hoover Institution historian, Arnold Beichman, who contributed to The American Spectator , once estimated that upwards of 20 million Soviet citizens perished in the gulag under Stalin alone in the 1930s. More recently, under Vladimir Putin, a man who learned his tactics in the KGB in the 1980s, one thinks of the 2006 death of Alexander Litvinenko , one of the earliest Putin purges of a dissident, and one of the earliest telltale signs that the new Russian president was a thug. In the case of Litvinenko, it was polonium-210 poisoning. The Litvinenko death evoked memories of the infamous “umbrella assassin” in Bulgaria in the 1980s. And of course, back in August, the plane of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Group leader who had led a rebellion against Putin two months earlier, was blown out of the sky . Communist thuggery has long been about precisely this: death. Death, death, death. I wrote here earlier this week about Lech Wałęsa’s statement to me last Friday in Washington, where he noted that there had been five documented cases of attempted assassination against him. I wrote about the plot that was organized against Wałęsa in January 1981. The communists failed to put a finger on Wałęsa that time, but four months later, in May 1981, they put two bullets in Pope John Paul II smack in the middle of St. Peter’s Square. All of which brings us back to the breaking news of Alexei Navalny’s death. For those who think this is an internal affair of concern only to Russians, take careful note of the statement from Joe Biden in June 2021 after meeting with Putin in Geneva. Asked what would happen if Navalny died in Russian custody, our president told the press: “I made it clear to [Putin] that I believe the consequences of that would be devastating for Russia.” Devastating , President Biden? How so? What would you do? Actually, what will you now do? Bear in mind, that Biden statement came well before Mad Dog Putin sent hordes of Russian boys into Ukraine in February 2022. The two-year anniversary of that war is coming up next week (Feb. 24). Back in December, the Wall Street Journal , citing a U.S. intelligence estimate, reported that Putin’s assault on the Ukraine “has devastated Russia’s preinvasion military machine,” with nearly 90 percent of its prewar army lost to injury or death. The figures are breathtaking: the report claims that 315,000 Russian personnel have been injured or killed since February 2022. Then again, I’m not shocked. I noted here as early as March 2022 , the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that the Russians always get their butts kicked in battle. That reality is already devastating for Russia. What will be the response to this single death of Alexei Navalny? Well, it isn’t something to start World War III over, or for America to escalate an already ugly situation with the Russkies. That’s for sure. But it’s also something requiring serious condemnation. Yes, but how so? In what form? What would you do as president of the United States? That’s not an easy decision. We shall see. But we know this much: this news isn’t good. READ MORE from Paul Kengor: The Last Hero of the Cold War … Lech Walesa Survives The Enduring Ronald Reagan"
"1","Former President Donald Trump has made news by criticizing NATO members for not paying their NATO dues. Newsweek reported Trump’s latest remarks to an anonymous leader of a presumably NATO country this way: The Republican presidential nominee frontrunner said the anonymous leader had asked whether the U.S. would protect the NATO nation, if Russia attacked. “I said, ‘You didn’t pay, you’re delinquent?’” Trump told the crowd on Saturday. “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.” For speaking the obvious if blunt truth that NATO members should pay their NATO bills, all manner of foreign policy elites have dumped on Trump. But wait. Let’s recall a little NATO history. In fact, Trump’s views on NATO not paying its bills exactly echo the views of, yes, in fact, no less than President Dwight D. Eisenhower. READ MORE from Jeffrey Lord: BREAKING: Biden Pal Bobulinski New Testimony to House Committees NATO was founded in 1949 as a collective security system, with then-Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed as the first Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), making him, in effect, NATO’s first leader. Eisenhower served until the British Lord Ismay was appointed NATO’s first secretary general in April of 1952. And, of course, Ike himself was elected U.S. president in November of 1952. With Trump’s critics freaking out over his criticism of NATO, it is worth remembering that Trump is not the first president to do so. He is following in Eisenhower’s footsteps. No less than Gen. and later U.S. President Eisenhower was not shy about criticizing the alliance for not paying its bills. Indeed, as president, Eisenhower would express his dissatisfaction to his secretary of defense, one Charles Wilson, becoming very unhappy when word of his NATO criticisms became public. In the second of his two seriously detailed Eisenhower biographies, Eisenhower: The President , historian Stephen Ambrose writes this of Eisenhower’s views on NATO (with bold print for emphasis supplied): The level of post-Korea defense spending continued to be a problem. In October, to Eisenhower’s great irritation, Wilson leaked to the press the Administration’s plans to sharply reduce personnel. The Europeans, fearing reduction in American combat strength in NATO, immediately protested to [Gen. Alfred] Gruenther [who had risen to the position of Supreme Allied Commander in Europe], who passed along their alarm to Eisenhower. In response Eisenhower began by complaining about Wilson, saying that “some people have more trouble in controlling their tongues than they do their wives.” But he also told Gruenther to remind his European friends that the stationing of American troops in Europe was always intended to be on a “temporary or emergency” basis. When Eisenhower was SACEUR he had frequently expressed the hope that American boys could go home in three or four years. Now he reminded Gruenther that the United States could neither build nor afford to maintain “a sort of Roman Wall to protect the world.” He also worried about the troops themselves; how long, he wondered, before European gratitude for their presence would turn to hostility toward foreign troops on their soil. When Gruenther passed along some more European criticism, Eisenhower began to lose his temper. “I get weary of the European habit of taking our money,” the President wrote, “resenting any slight hint as to what they should do, and then assuming, in addition, full right to criticize us as bitterly as they may desire. In fact, it sometimes appears that their indulgence in this kind of criticism varies in direct ratio to the amount of help we give them.” In fact, the whole thing made him mad as hell, and “makes me wonder whether the Europeans are as grown up and mature as they try to make it appear.” Ambrose also writes: The Europeans, meanwhile, were telling [Eisenhower Secretary of State John Foster] Dulles — and Eisenhower’s special representative to NATO, William Draper — that they could not afford to spend any more on defense…. Thus early patterns were established. Eisenhower was determined to force the Europeans to spend more on defense, and to achieve political and military unity. Bottom line? Clearly former President Trump’s critics of his views on NATO paying its share of the bills are utterly unaware that Trump is, in fact, following exactly the thinking of NATO founding Gen. and later U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. That would be the same Eisenhower rated today as a great president. With reason."

"1","O n the one hand, Donald Trump, the former and perhaps future president of the United States, seems uniquely hapless. He lost an election unlike any other before — one in which insecure mail-in balloting proliferated, many states made constitutionally dubious changes to their voting procedures, and Big Tech put a decisive and perhaps outcome-altering thumb on the scale. Even worse, Trump last year became the first former president to be criminally indicted — four separate times. Tough luck, for sure. But on the other hand, there is one thing that should provide no small amount of solace to Trump and his many supporters. As we are seeing unfold across the country in real time, Trump is truly blessed with the best enemies. For all of Trump’s bad luck, he is also aided right now by some very, very good luck. Consider some of the current biggest enemies of Trump, as he marches through the Republican presidential primary and looks toward a general election rematch with President Joe Biden. First, there is Biden himself. The nominal president of the United States is an indescribable embarrassment to the nation — physically corpse-like, palpably senile, chronically misinformed, utterly lacking in judgment, and generally clueless as to where he is and what words emanate from his mouth. He is a disgrace to his office, and it is a shocking public disservice that his wife and handlers even permit him to seek reelection in such a debilitated state. Special counsel Robert Hur’s report filed last week, in which he explained that one reason he is not recommending criminal charges against Biden is because he is mentally unfit to stand trial, is an astonishing open admission of the harrowing reality Democratic Party elites have frantically tried to hide. Second, there is former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump’s final competitor in the Republican presidential primary. Haley is the very embodiment of all that was wrong with the pre-Trump GOP: She is a laissez-faire fundamentalist out of touch with Republican voters’ concerns and priorities, a strident neoconservative personally corrupted by the military- industrial complex (viz., Boeing), an enthusiast for mass immigration who is guided not by voters’ clearly expressed desire to close the border but by corporations’ desire to keep it open, and a coward when it comes to the righteous prosecution of the culture war against the forces of civilizational arson. Haley’s caricaturable nature makes her a perfect foil for Trump. Third, there is Alvin Bragg, the Soros-funded lawyer in New York City now prosecuting Trump on the laughable grounds that “hush money” payments ex-Trump fixer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election amounted to falsified business records in furtherance of … well, something. Bragg’s indictment never actually stipulates what the records were falsified in furtherance of — and Bragg needs an additional crime in order to 1) overcome the falsified recording crime’s three-year statute of limitations and to 2) enhance to a felony what would otherwise be a mere misdemeanor. Bragg’s is a remarkably frivolous case, and the fact that this is how he expends prosecutorial resources in a metropolis now in the throes of a generational crime epidemic makes him another ideal foe for Trump. Finally, there is Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis, whose courtroom meltdown this week, and the likelihood that she lied in court about the timing of her extramarital affair with her own appointed special prosecutor, has crystallized what already seemed likely: The Georgia prosecution, which once seemed the most dangerous of Trump’s four criminal cases, is imploding. Willis came across as highly unprofessional during Thursday’s hearing on her possible disqualification from the case. She snapped at Trump’s attorneys, and she was warned numerous times by the presiding judge. At this point, Trump’s Georgia case is not reaching a verdict before the election; the only questions are whether a trial commences at all , and whether Willis ends up being the one to go to jail instead of Trump or his codefendants. It is often said that it is better to be lucky than good. Donald Trump could still be derailed by special counsel Jack Smith’s federal probe in Washington, D.C, and he is about to get smacked by an unjust verdict in New York Attorney General Letitia James’ civil fraud case. But everywhere else Trump looks, Lady Luck seems to be shining.

"1","A new cathedral spire has finally emerged from scaffolding nearly four years after flames engulfed Paris’s storied Notre Dame Cathedral in April 2019. Intense reconstruction efforts began immediately following the accidental blaze, which investigators attributed to either an electrical short-circuit or a cigarette. But the fire sparked equally intense debates about how Notre Dame should be rebuilt — and looking to the cathedral’s history for guidance turned up more questions than answers. Medieval Beginnings and Revolutionary Disruptions It all started In 1160, when Bishop Maurice de Sully of Paris began plans for a large cathedral in the city dedicated to Mary, the mother of God. Three years later, builders broke ground for Notre-Dame de Paris with King Louis VII and Pope Alexander III in attendance. Construction spanned several hundred years, though the cathedral was mostly finished by 1345. Notre Dame underwent further construction throughout the centuries due to additions and maintenance. More than 400 years later, the 18th century proved tumultuous not only for French Catholics but also for their physical churches. Notre Dame was no exception. Revolutionaries seized control of Church property in 1789, passed a law requiring clergy to pledge allegiance to the new, anti-Catholic French nation, destroyed churches and monasteries across the country, and established the notorious Cult of Reason. Though it was replaced fairly swiftly by Robespierre’s own Cult of the Supreme Being, the short-lived Cult of Reason left a permanent mark on Notre Dame. The cathedral escaped destruction, but it was transformed into the Temple of Reason after revolutionaries looted almost everything, leaving only the bells. In 1793, the Cult of Reason hosted its anti-Catholic “Festival of Reason” in the church, replete with busts of philosophers and a “seductively dressed” woman representing the goddess of liberty. That same fall, the French government had ordered an alteration to Notre Dame’s exterior. The west facade of the cathedral held 28 statues portraying biblical kings. Ever unrelenting in their antimonarchist fervor, the revolutionaries removed the 500-year-old statues, brought them to the cathedral square, and ceremoniously decapitated each statue. Notre Dame’s First Restoration Thankfully, the revolution didn’t last forever. In 1842, France’s newly appointed inspector of historic monuments commissioned the restoration of Notre Dame. He tapped young architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc to lead the project, which lasted until 1864. Much like the architects working to rebuild Notre Dame today, Viollet-le-Duc had to determine how to reconcile the Cathedral’s various architectural styles. He left his own imprint on the cathedral, adding a few anachronistic elements in his otherwise thorough recreation of the medieval church. Though Notre Dame had been restored to its former glory, the effects of the French Revolution were still palpable. A 1905 law established laïcité , a principle of strict separation between church and state — a separation so “strict” and unbridgeable that the state owns the churches. The 1905 law preserved the revolution-era seizure of Church property and recognized churches as state- owned buildings rather than privately held property. Following the fire in 2019, this complicated relationship between church and state came to the forefront of renovation efforts. Owned by the French government, occupied by the Catholic Church, and claimed symbolically by the French populace, the reconstruction has been far from straightforward. Attempts to Modernize Notre Dame Almost immediately, French President Emmanuel Macron proposed the construction of a modern spire. Then–Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced a competition for “fresh ideas” for the cathedral’s reconstruction. The submissions, according to Architectural Digest , “ranged from the tasteful and restrained, to the borderline inscrutable, to social experiments never intended to be built.” Some architects proposed a modern reimagination of the previous spire, which had been built by Viollet-de-Luc in his reconstruction, but other architects submitted plans for contemporary sculptures, a greenhouse, and a public swimming pool. (RELATED: France Burns, Macron Dances ) Though it’s easy to laugh at some of the more ridiculous proposals, every step of the reconstruction process has involved serious efforts to modernize the medieval cathedral. In the early months of reconstruction, France’s chief architect of the historic monuments service said that he would “resign rather than allow a modern spire … to be built atop the cathedral’s roof.” He won the argument, and the spire revealed this week is nearly identical to the original, built with the same construction methods and materials. Only one small change was made : the golden rooster topping the spire has been transformed into a phoenix with flaming wings. But consensus has not yet been reached on what to do about Notre Dame’s famous chapel windows, which were undamaged by the fire. Last December, Macron proposed that contemporary stained glass by French artists should replace the chapel windows designed by Viollet-le-Duc in 1859. Once again, the selection would occur through a competition. Surprisingly, Macron is merely the mouthpiece for the democratization of Notre Dame’s restoration. The local archbishop, Laurent Ulrich, supports the introduction of contemporary elements to the cathedral. The archbishop explained that he felt the church should not be rebuilt “without leaving a trace of this event [the fire], of this emotion.” Ulrich proposed the introduction of stained-glass windows that “will remain as signs of our times.” Last summer, he approved “new, resolutely contemporary liturgical furnishings” for the church that perfectly resemble the drab, awkward modern architecture of many post-Vatican II Catholic Churches. One commentator called the new furnishings a “70s Ikea design, unworthy of the cathedral’s builders.” As of this week, the cathedral remains ensconced in 600 tons of scaffolding and is expected to reopen for the first time since the fire on December 8. The French state might not have Notre Dame’s best interest at heart, and the aesthetic sensibilities of the local Catholic Church might leave something to be desired, but the cathedral is beloved the world over. The emergence of the newly restored spire this week brings some normalcy back to the Paris skyline, blessedly free — for now — of any modern attempts to improve upon the cathedral’s iconic exterior.

"1","I n 2005, I published a book titled The Death of Feminism . At the time, I was focused on how Western feminists had become obsessed more with the alleged “occupation” of a country that has never existed — Palestine — than with the real occupation of women’s bodies in Gaza and on the West Bank, who were being forced into hijab, niqab, and child and arranged marriages, or who were being honor killed by their families for minor or imagined infractions. This form of femicide is primarily a Muslim-on-Muslim crime both in the West and in Muslim countries but, to a lesser extent, also takes place among Hindus in India, and, less frequently, among Sikhs. Honor killing is likely a tribal custom that religious leaders have failed to abolish, I wrote, one in which women also collaborate . Both Stalinized and Palestinianized feminists and rabid Islamists denounced me as an “Islamophobe” for prioritizing the rights of women of color over and above the rights of the men (and women) of color who were terrorizing and even killing them. I was also condemned as a “Zionist” for questioning the sacredness of Palestinian victimhood. READ MORE: The American People Know the Real Hamas Thus, I may have been among a handful of people not surprised by the feminist silence on Hamas’ Oct. 7 pogrom-on- steroids. It does not ease my sorrow that so many others, including the worldwide media and professoriate, human rights groups, and the United Nations, are also actively engaging in Oct. 7 denialism, as well as in relentless and vicious blood libels against the Jewish state, every single day. By the late afternoon of Oct. 7, I was a cognitive warrior on fire. Between Oct. 11 and Jan. 25, I had published 24 articles on the subject and been interviewed about it 10 times . Most second-wave feminists have died, suffered strokes, or are struggling with either dementia or cancer. Many are disabled. They are no longer “dancing in the streets.” But some of my long- time allies still attend conferences, march, sign petitions, write articles, and speak out. These are the feminist allies who did not respond to the articles that I sent them about their shameful, even unbearable, silence. Perhaps they felt that Israel deserved whatever it got but were too embarrassed to say that to me. Instead, they said nothing. Only one such feminist ally responded by sending me articles by Masha Gessen and Judith Butler . She suggested that reading their ideas about the moral superiority of vulnerable Jewish Diaspora life and the advantages of dissolving the Jewish state would “open my mind to the truth.” She also sent me an article that blamed Benjamin Netanyahu — and only Netanyahu — for the failure of a “two state solution — the only fair solution.” I immediately sent her my critique of Butler and Gessen; I sent her Bassem Eid’s fact-based piece in Newsweek . Eid summarizes the long history of Arab rejection of the offers for a Palestinian state, first proffered by the British, then by the UN, and, finally, by Israel at least six times. Thus far, she has not responded. Another long-time feminist (a friend, not merely an ally) is adamant that Israel is “committing genocide” and is an “apartheid, colonial, occupying state.” I told her that we cannot discuss Israel ever again. But now our conversations are thinned, brittle. There is no way we can discuss Oct. 7 without endangering our suddenly fragile friendship. Why are my views so different? Here’s one reason. Most Western pro-Palestinian feminists have never lived in a Muslim country or moved in Muslim circles, as I have — and still do. When I was young and oh-so-foolish, I traveled to Kabul with my Westernized Afghan husband, whom I had met at college. Once we landed, an airport official smoothly, officiously, removed my American passport; I never saw it again. I found myself trapped in the 10th century with no way back to the future. I was unexpectedly held in captivity. I had to live with my mother-in-law, who was one of three wives and the mother of six of her polygamous husband’s 21 children. She tried to convert me to Islam every day. I learned a great deal about living in an Islamic, theocratic state where both infidels and Shiia (Hazara) Muslims were despised, servants routinely mistreated, and women held in contempt. I wrote about this in An American Bride in Kabul . I read almost every book about the country, every memoir written by Afghans and by foreigners who visited Muslim countries. I researched the history of the Jews of Afghanistan and found a chilling, personal connection to their story. It won the National Jewish Book Award for 2013. Unlike me, most feminists had absolutely no knowledge of Islamic gender and religious apartheid; of Islamic imperialism, Islamic colonialism, or Islamic conversion via the sword; no fact-based understanding that Muslims practiced anti-black slavery and sex-slavery. Unlike me, few had ever visited or spent time in Israel, although some had. In either event, so many had been successfully indoctrinated to believe that Israel was the worst country on earth. Perhaps, unlike me, most feminists had not attended Hebrew School in Boro Park from the time they were 5 years old until they turned 14. And few had been members of radical, left-wing Zionist groups as I had — groups they probably would have respected. ***** I was also not surprised by the feminist silence for another reason. In the very early 1970s, I experienced antisemitism among leftist and lesbian feminists. It was not political. I was told that Jews like me were too pushy, too smart, too sexy and were taking over the movement. Such views sent me straight to Israel. A small group that included Lilith magazine founder Aviva Cantor Zuckoff, Cheryl Moch, and me held a press conference on the subject; for years, we tried to interest leading Jewish feminists in joining us to discuss this. At the time, neither Andrea Dworkin nor Letty Cottin Pogrebin was interested in such a discussion. In the mid-1970s, I tried to get feminist signatures for petitions against the UN’s resolution that Zionism equals racism. Some signed, but many feminists refused to do so. I explained that anti-Zionism equals racism. I got nowhere with the feminist Marxists or with others who hated Jews for more personal reasons . I also began working with Israeli feminists in Haifa, Jerusalem, and Tel Aviv and taking American journalists to Israel in the hope that they’d modify or expand their views. And they did. In 1979, I was hired by the United Nations to organize a feminist conference in Oslo, to take place right before the UN conference on women in Copenhagen . Lilith interviewed me under a pseudonym about the pre-Durban-like psychological pogrom that Copenhagen turned out to be. Like other women who’ve worked at the UN , I, too, was sexually harassed and then assaulted by my employer there, the late Dr. Davidson Nicol, an under-secretary general and the executive director of the UN Institute for Training and Research. I had invited my ally and dear friend, Robin Morgan, to the Oslo conference as Gloria Steinem’s last–minute replacement. She refused to support me in confronting Davidson (he had sexually harassed other women in Oslo); Robin justified her refusal to do so on the basis of his skin color — black — a concern that trumped her supposed commitment to sexual harassment, rape, sisterhood, and friendship. Robin said, “It would look bad if a white feminist accused a black man of rape.” This concern was not shared by many of the Black African women who attended the conference. As the late Motlalepula Chabaku said, “Let’s confront this dirty dog.” Upon returning to New York, Robin badmouthed me as a Zionist and/or as a “paranoid” Zionist. She did so in order to cover up her planned involvement with Nicol on behalf of Ms. magazine. Nicol allowed her to write the “Introduction to the Proceedings” of the conference that I and my assistant, Dr. Barbara Joans, had organized — and she “borrowed” the very best feminists whom we had found for her anthology Sisterhood Is Global . She also “appropriated” these same women who became key players in Ms. magazine’s global network . This was a pity. I would have given Robin my rolodex if she’d only asked. I do not “do” anthologies as she does. However, had she supported me, Robin might not have had the kind of access to the UN that she wanted. I could not sue Nicol — he had diplomatic immunity. In any event, I wanted feminist justice behind closed doors. I did not want Nicol to go to his grave believing he could divide the likes of us. I asked Gloria for her help. She agreed. We held a meeting in Gloria’s apartment. Promises were made, but they were never kept. Robin never publicly acknowledged what she had done. No one ever confronted Nicol. I had invited Charlotte Bunch and Letty to this private meeting. Letty told me that “if Robin had done this to her, she would have killed her.” At the time, my close friend Andrea Dworkin read my extensive narrative, sighed, and said she believed that he had raped me — but she also believed that Robin was truly concerned that it would make “feminism” look bad if a white feminist were to accuse a black man of rape. That was Andrea. She always knew which side her bread was buttered on and whom she absolutely could not afford to offend. Nearly 40 years later, in 2018, I wrote about all this in A Politically Incorrect Feminist . In 1981, I convened a panel on feminism and antisemitism at the National Women’s Studies Association’s Annual meeting that took place in Storrs, Connecticut. I turned the tapes over to Letty Cottin Pogrebin, who then wrote an article on this subject for Ms. magazine, which in turn led to a chapter in her 1991 book Deborah, Golda, and Me . Eleven years after Oslo, both Robin and Gloria supported Anita Hill when she made her allegations against Justice Clarence Thomas. To them, that was an acceptably feminist option because both the accuser and the accused were black. More importantly, Hill was a liberal feminist, and Thomas was a conservative. Thus, I understood, long ago, that leading feminists could and would sacrifice some of their basic principles for other principles, and/or for personal, political, or financial gain. Feminists are human beings, as close to the apes as to the angels. They are also political animals. Some are dangerously flawed human beings. There is also something that has not been said about the Oct. 7 feminist silence, something that professor Amy Elman and I have been discussing. Long ago, some feminists (the “abolitionists”) strongly opposed pornography; others felt that censoring it would harm their own lesbian sexual rights or their heterosexual sexual rights outside of marriage. Some feminists opposed sadistic violence toward prostituted women. Others either enjoyed it or were willing to live with it. Pornography, however, has gotten more sadistic. It has influenced teenagers to dress like “hoes” and celebrities to appear half-naked, crawling around the stage like erotically crazed animals, even as they are accompanied by male partners dressed in tuxedos. In my view, what ISIS and Hamas did was influenced by the most violent pornography. Feminists should have been the first to recognize this. Instead, they not only remained silent for months — they have never linked what Hamas or ISIS did to the influence of pornography. Let’s remember that the Navy Seals who assassinated Osama bin Laden also found a tremendous stash of pornography that has never been made available . Bin Laden was a man who kept his four wives in burqas, even when they went swimming in their own private pool. (READ MORE: Bin Laden’s Letter Praised by TikTok ) However, feminist abolitionists who are still active but have remained silent have been taught to hate Israel and view Hamas as a “resistance” movement. They lack the courage to uphold their own unpopular analysis of pornography, lest it be used to support Israel. Once Hamas/Iran unleashed the horror of Oct. 7, I understood that the world would never be the same — at least not for Israelis, and not for Jews who care about Israeli and Jewish survival. I also understood that Oct. 7 advanced World War III between the Judeo-Christian West and those who yearn for a global Caliphate. By Oct. 8, my friend and ally Mandy Sanghera , a British-Indian Sikh activist, and I had taken to social media . (I’d worked with Mandy before in our 2021 rescue of 398 women from Afghanistan and in other honor-based violence projects). We were up in arms about Hamas’ pogrom/massacre — and about the collective feminist silence. Mandy posted a piece on her WordPress blog titled “ Yet Again, Sexual Violence is a Weapon of War, This Time in Israel. What Are We Going To Do About It ?” By Oct. 11, I had published a piece at Jewish News Service about the “ women-hating women who support Hamas ,” which was also reposted widely . Mandy and I kept talking and writing. For the first time in her career, she began experiencing blowback for her “too”-pro-Israel views. Mandy was being warned, bullied, and de- friended. The non-feminist media, Jewish media, and journalists all weighed in. Liel Leibowitz at Tablet on Oct. 8; Monica Osborne at Newsweek on Oct. 10. Also on Oct. 8, the press team at the Independent Women’s Forum (IWF), a conservative group, issued a statement titled “ Unprovoked Terror Attack by Hamas On Israel, Israel Responds: It’s War .” Senior policy fellow Dr. Meaghan Mobbs denounced the “barbaric targeting of women and girls [as] vile and deserv[ing of] the world’s contempt.” Senior fellow Dr. Qanta Ahmed described Oct. 7 as “heinous acts of Islamist jihadists backed by Iran [that] imperils all nations working for peace with Israel.” The IWF published 10 such articles between Oct. 8 , 2023, and Jan. 1 , 2024. On Oct. 10, Joe Biden’s White House weighed in. The president described what Hamas did as “evil,” but mass media outlets continued to insist that “such reports [about rape] were unsubstantiated.” By Oct. 11, the left-wing newspaper Forward claimed that Tablet’s details consisted of “murky” “allegations” that “have not been substantiated” and dismissed or defamed Leibowitz as a “right-wing” journalist. With one exception, left-liberal feminists maintained their silence. On Oct. 12, the radical feminist group Women’s Declaration International USA, whose views I share, published a statement in which it declared: “Like many, we watched in horror as Hamas invaded southern Israel, raping Jewish women and girls, murdering innocent civilians, and taking (civilians) hostage…. We are disgusted to see reports of Americans championing the cause of Hamas.” On Oct. 13, Mandy and I published a piece at New English Review titled “ Rape as a Weapon of War, This Time in Israel. Why are Feminist Silent? ,” which was translated into Polish and picked up widely . I sent all my articles to Gloria Steinem, with a note asking her to “help.” She responded at once and said she would “ask the Feminist Majority folks [who publish Ms. ] if they have responded.” It took Ms. magazine two months before it published anything, and when it did, the article left everything to be desired. ***** As I was writing about Oct. 7, I was being inundated by the sights and sounds of protesters on my screens and in my city. They were marching for Hamas! The sight of Jewish blood had thrilled them and unleashed their murderousness. They were marching across the streets of America, both women and men — for “Palestine.” Everywhere, anarchists, Islamists, lesbians, “queers,” feminists, and leftists were creating an auditory nightmare with their multiple drummers, multiple whistleblowers, and multiple megaphone-users. They chanted incessantly; carried “Palestinian” flags; wore keffiyehs; shut down bridges, tunnels, and train stations; terrified children in cancer hospitals; and physically and verbally attacked those who were visibly Jewish, both in universities, on the streets, in restaurants, and at home. I did not hear these pro-Hamas marchers, especially the lesbian, “queer,” and feminist ones, calling for an end to rape, woman-battering, or the persecution of homosexuals and “queers” in Gaza. I saw no signs that condemned honor killing or polygamy. No one called for reproductive freedom for American women or for an Equal Rights Amendment. On Oct. 18, I published a piece at the New York Post together with Mandy titled “ Response to Hamas horror shows the feminist movement has lost its moral compass .” It was republished widely . No leading American feminist or long-time feminist ally reached out to me. On Oct. 17 and on Oct. 24, two Israeli journalists, Shalva Weil and Hamutal Gouri , respectively, published articles in the Israeli media condemning both the UN and Western feminists for their silence and described Hamas’ massacre as “horrific.” On Nov. 23, a third Israeli journalist, Amelie Botbol , described the Oct. 7 massacre as a “horrifying picture of systemic sexual assaults.” Leading American feminist experts on violence against women, including rape and rape trauma syndrome, still remained silent. On Oct. 23, dozens of Israeli women’s groups, and some Jewish groups, asked UN Women to issue a statement. They wrote , “It is unthinkable that a UN agency responsible for women’s rights ignores the abduction of women, babies, girls, children, and men … and the murder of over a thousand civilians.” Thus far, only Western conservatives, Israelis, and some Jews stood up for the murdered, tortured, and kidnapped victims of Oct. 7. On Oct. 26, Gloria Steinem’s assistant described the articles that I kept sending as “wonderful” but emailed me that: Right now, she’s [Gloria’s] scaling back on all projects and affiliations, particularly outside of her true expertise, in service of her own writing, so can’t be of much more help here, but we will happily continue to read and support anything you send. Thanks. Gloria is nearly 90 years old, and this may be true. No matter what, we go back, and I retain a sentimental affection for her. On Oct. 27, the UN’s Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) issued a vague statement concerning “the gender dimension of the conflict.” It wrote: The Committee calls upon all parties to systematically address the gender dimension of conflict. It is deeply concerned that the gendered dimensions of conflict will be significantly exacerbated for women who are internally displaced. I’ve never read such a clear statement — have you? I continued to publish articles about Oct. 7 all through November. On Nov. 23 and 25, articles were published at the Times of Israel , as well as at MSNBC , about the Hamas rapes, which all questioned the silence of the UN and of “feminists.” On Nov. 25, 49 days after the pogrom/massacre, the Washington Post quoted Israeli Police Chief Kobi Shabtai — but also noted that a Hamas official says the “Israeli claims are inaccurate.” On Nov. 29, I published another piece at RealClearPolitics titled “ The Failure of Western Feminism When It’s Most Needed .” This piece was seen by hundreds of thousands of readers. My feminist allies remained silent. But, significantly, on Nov. 30, Dahlia Lithwick, a lawyer, journalist, and senior editor at Slate (and a Jew), together with five other authors, published an important piece at Slate about Oct. 7 — as did journalist and author Christina Lamb in the Times of London just a few days later on Dec. 2. Lamb wrote that a delegation of “Israeli feminists and human rights experts were going to lobby and protest outside UN headquarters. Sheryl Sandberg, the former chief operating officers of Facebook will speak.” On Dec. 1, the IWF issued a strong statement titled “Independent Women’s Forum And Independent Women’s Voice Decry Rape Of Women And Girls In Israel And Call On All Advocates For Women To Condemn Hamas.” Also on Dec. 1, nearly two months after Oct. 7, UN Women finally issued a rather vague statement about Israeli and Palestinian women who are at risk of “gender-based violence.” If Palestinian women are being raped — who are the rapists? Surely not members of the IDF. UN Women wrote: “We deeply regret that military operations have resumed in Gaza, and we reiterate that all women, Israeli women, Palestinian women, as all others, are entitled to a life lived in safety and free from violence.” After this UN style of misleading evenhandedness, the statement declared, “We unequivocally condemn the brutal attacks by Hamas on Israel.” On Dec. 4, the tide of coverage began to turn when philanthropist and technology executive Sheryl Sandberg joined the Israel Mission to the UN’s special session on Hamas’ Oct. 7 rapes, torture, kidnapping, and murder of Israeli civilians. “Silence is complicity … and in the face of terror, we cannot be quiet,” she stated . “That is why we are all here today to speak about unspeakable acts.” On Dec. 4, 58 days after the pogrom, the left-liberal media began to cover the massacre . On Dec. 5, Letty Cottin Pogrebin published a piece titled “ Today no jokes, memes, politics, or culture. Just Israel, Hamas, women & children ” on Substack; she then published a nearly identical piece at the Forward on Dec. 13. In it she challenged the feminist silence about Oct. 7, writing, “[A]s a Jew and as a woman, I refuse to let Hamas’ brutal assault on Israeli women and girls be forgotten in the fog of war.” But, she added: I’ve been advocating for Palestinian statehood and protesting the Occupation for more than 30 years. Today, I’m belaboring the details of the terrorists’ cruelty not to eclipse the extreme suffering of Palestinians at the hands of Israel but to underscore the lack of outrage or compassion for Jewish suffering at the hands of Hamas. Neat trick. Letty herself was one of the silent feminists. And no one can accuse her of not being sympathetic to Palestinians. Her J-Street-style criticism of Israel was also well known. It was now 60 days after Oct. 7, and about 55 days since I first reached out to Gloria Steinem. On Dec. 6, Ms. magazine finally provided a “ reading list ” about the rape of women in many war zones, such as the Congo, Ethiopia, Yemen, Syria, and Ukraine, which also focused on women’s attempts to “wage peace.” Oddly enough, the magazine did not include the piece that I wrote for On the Issues magazine in 1995, perhaps the first of its kind, on the subject of rape as a weapon of war. In it, I described rape as “gender cleansing” and documented the use of rape as a political weapon by Muslim men against Muslim and Hindu women in Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, India, Iran, and Pakistan. I noted that the UN had remained silent, as had Muslim leaders. I wrote: The Bosnian Ambassador to the U.N. said he “could find no [raped] woman in condition to speak.” Alexandra Stiglmayer found the (Bosnian) raped women “broken,” “intimidated,” “withdrawn,” “crying,” “afflicted with nightmares,” “insomnia,” “depression,” “panic disorders,” “suicidal.” Way back then, I noted: Survivors are haunted by those who heard their screams but turned their backs; those who blamed the victim and collaborated with the rapist/torturer/killer; those who minimized, or exaggerated, or merely misunderstood what rape or torture is about; those who preached, authoritatively, righteously, against revenge, but envisioned no justice. Perhaps it was now safe enough for Democratic Party officials and feminist leaders to issue a statement. And they soon did so. On or about Dec. 10, women’s rights leaders and Democratic Party elected functionaries in New York state published a statement . I was told that work on this statement began on Nov. 29, and that it took seven days to compose. When I called one of the organizers, a very hard-working and decent feminist, she apologized for not having initially asked me to sign (I later did so), and I asked if her group had reached out to feminists who had declined to sign it. She said yes. She was reluctant to share these names. I laughed. Then I told her what the names probably were. She was ever so surprised. For example, not a single member of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women had signed. It also explained why it took seven days to craft the desired even-handed document. Here is some of their language: We grieve as we witness the heartbreaking anguish of women, children, and all those who suffer through no fault of their own in both Israel and Gaza. We mourn the deaths of so many Palestinian and Israeli civilians who have been killed in this war. We long for a just peace. To denounce rape as a weapon of war is not to express approval or alignment with the governing coalition in Israel, nor does it signal support for the bombings in Gaza. But as feminists we are committed to the universal principle that rape must always be condemned; we bear witness to the mountain of evidence that Hamas and other terrorist groups used rape as a weapon of war against Israeli women and girls; and we demand accountability for crimes that must never be tolerated by the world community. Most of all, we stand with the victims of gender-based atrocities, with the survivors and with those who did not survive, and we raise our voices in solidarity with them. On Dec. 12, Biden’s White House condemned Hamas’ refusal to return hostages and their use of rape to terrorize, stating, “In the weeks since October 7, survivors and witnesses have bravely shared accounts of severe sexual violence by Hamas terrorists against women and children in Israel.” Formerly silent Democrats had begun to “own” the story. Did they want to be able to claim that they’d stood up for Israel in order to impress pro-Israel voters? Going forward, would the Dec. 10 statement and Letty’s late-in-the-day article allow pro- Biden Democrats to claim that they had decried the Oct. 7 rapes? On Dec. 14, Veteran Feminists of America (VFA) (previously constrained by its not-for- profit status) posted a statement on “Rape as a Weapon of War”: “We decry rape at all times, and especially as an instrument of war as it was practiced by the terrorist organization, Hamas, on October 7. VFA opposes all discrimination, gender-based violence and all crimes against humanity.” On Dec. 15, Marxist-feminist Katha Pollitt followed Letty’s example and challenged the feminist silence in a piece at the Nation . Like Letty, Katha herself had been silent for many months. She wrote: This silence sits oddly with how quick our movement has been to credit much iffier claims and to raise consciousness around sexual misconduct that falls far short of rape. What happened to the clarion call to “believe women”? What happened to #metoo?… Where’s the Women’s March? Feminist Majority? The National Women’s Studies Association? On Dec. 19 — 73 days after the massacre — Ms. magazine posted an article that mentioned all victims of gender-based violence, especially those from conflict in Afghanistan, the Congo, Ethiopia, Iran, South Sudan, Sudan, Ukraine, and Yemen. Geeta Rao Gupta wrote: “We are deeply concerned by the increased risk of [gender-based violence] for women and girls in Gaza and the West Bank as a result of displacement, among other factors.” This article only mentioned Israel in the fourth paragraph, and then only as part of argument about both Palestinian and Israeli women. The author was trying to normalize (or hide) what happened on Oct. 7 by merging it with other rapes in conflict zones. Subsequently, in January, at the World Economic Forum in Davos (Jan. 15–19), Israel government officials screened the 48-minute video of pogrom horror to three separate groups; Mandy Sanghera moderated a panel sponsored by Shelley Zalis’ Female Quotient in which rape in Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Israel was discussed. The families of Israeli hostages spoke on another panel. On Jan. 25, four Muslim women (Farhana Khorshed, Soraya Deen, Raheel Raza, and Zainab Khan), three of whom I know and with whom I have worked, and one who had been recently funded to visit southern Israel, published a piece in Newsweek , in which they wrote: We as Muslim women have condemned the Oct.7 attacks…. Our faith demands that we speak out and ensure that there is no justification for these atrocious acts…. Speaking about those crimes is the only way to stand with the victims, which is vital to healing for survivors… It seems very likely that bias, antisemitism, and politics contributed to this silence…. If we, as Muslim women, do not raise our voices against this, we are giving a green light to other extremist groups such as Boko Haram, ISIS, and Hezbollah, who are already emboldened in their acts of terrorism and violence, to act like Hamas. On Jan. 31, Sheryl Sandberg, hosted by Lord John Mendelsohn, chaired an event in the House of Lords titled “Stand Against Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in the October 7th Hamas Terror Attack.” Allow me to give Sandberg the last word . In a CNN article published in November, she wrote: On October 7, Hamas terrorists committed unspeakable atrocities that we must speak about — and speak about loudly. Numerous witnesses have testified that sexual violence was widespread on that day…. Yet some are flat-out denying that these atrocities occurred…. Not loudly condemning the rapes of October 7 — or any rapes — is a massive step backward for the women — and men — of the world…. We must denounce these rapes in every conversation, at every rally, and on signs held on every street corner. We must forget our conflicting politics and remember our common humanity. Sheryl: Brava!

"1","It’s mid-February 2024. In a desultory way, I am packing up and getting ready to leave Sandpoint, Idaho. I have spent the happiest days of my life here. Tommy and I and Tommy’s best friends here, Peter Feierabend and his son and daughter, played together, hiked together, were inseparable. READ MORE from Ben Stein: True Facts About America In Sandpoint, a father could leave his kids to play all day, tell them to return at dinner, and the kids would do it. Now, 25 years have passed. Tommy entered immortality on July 4, 2023. That horrible day, much of me died as well. So, Sandpoint has never been quite the same. I cannot tell you just what a gash losing your one and only son causes in your life. Many years ago when both my Pop and I worked together at the White House for the Peacemaker, Richard Nixon, I asked my father for an obscure statistic. “Please only do it if you have nothing more important to do this afternoon,” I told Pop. He smiled at me and in one drag inhaled his Marlboro so deeply that he turned half of it to ash. “What do you think I have to do that’s more important than helping my one and only son?” he asked, and then he stood up from his brown leather chair and hugged me. I tried to follow that general principle with Tommy for all of his life. I follow it with my wife and my closest friends so far, and it’s been a pleasure. I followed it with my father and sat by his bedside at the Washington Hospital Center in 1999 for eight weeks until he expired, with my sister and I holding his hands and reading the Psalms to him. I try to do it with my glorious wifey every day. She is a Goddess, and if I don’t act upon that truth I am a fool to live. I often fail, and I am ashamed about it. Now, I am leaving the home where Tommy and I lived out so much of his childhood. I hurt all over keenly from that truth. I will never again be young. I will never again have a son young enough to hide behind a parked car at midnight and hurl snowballs at me. “Life goes by pretty quick. If you don’t slow down and look around, you might just miss it.” Ferris Bueller said that , and of course he was right. Now, I live a life of astonishing privilege. Part of that, a huge part, was having Tommy for 37 years. I’ll be leaving my home here soon. But how long before we meet again. I’m 79. There are not many rivers to cross and to watch my son leaping into Priest Lake, swimming under my boat for an adventure as a bubble monster. Life goes by pretty quick. I make prime rib eye for my wife every evening, and it’s a privilege.

"1","Some people find God after falling off a horse, but most Christians approach faith on a day-to-day basis through a cocktail made up of God’s grace, prayer, the cultivation of virtues and sacraments, and also, to some extent, human affections. Although sentiment is neither essential nor constant in our relationship with God, often, in moments of spiritual drought, we comfort ourselves remembering days when our human heart experienced God’s love, in that famous shrine of the Virgin, in that inspired homily from the village priest, in a Good Friday procession, in the solitude of that hermitage where you went to weep in front of the tabernacle. And, beyond grace, if anything moves the affections of man, if anything can lead our feelings toward God, it is the aesthetics. There is an official liturgy, to avoid abuses and doctrinal errors, to guarantee respect for the Holy Sacrament, but also so that we learn to approach God, not only with the soul, but also with the senses. Beauty is paramount. St. John Paul II wrote about it in his 1999 Letter to Artists : In perceiving that all he had created was good, God saw that it was beautiful as well. The link between good and beautiful stirs fruitful reflection. In a certain sense, beauty is the visible form of the good, just as the good is the metaphysical condition of beauty. If the aesthetic and the emotional were not important, they would not have been a priority target of the enemies of God in postmodern times. From within the Catholic Church itself, hundreds of people have sought to destroy the beauty of the rite, art, and religious architecture for the sake of a supposed renewal: They tried to do away with the liturgy for being too old fashioned and to attract young people (who never came); they strove to change the classical religious architecture for the architectural ugliness of the 20th century (and were surprised that this did nothing to fill the churches either); it is as stupid as if, to fill a church with atheists, some priest chooses to innovate and preach in his homilies that God does not exist. READ MORE by Itxu Díaz: Wokies Claim Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel Creations Exemplify ‘White Fragility’ Those who defended the building of new churches in industrial-style architecture — we should really call it “Soviet architecture” — used the same failed reasoning as those enlightened adepts of liberation theology. Fin-de-siècle relativism, which also wreaked havoc within the Church, was used as an argument for not rejecting the new religious ugliness: They figured that a church built like a concrete sports hall, diaphanous, with the tabernacle hidden behind some stone off to the side, was as equally a valid artistic manifestation as the imposing Gothic, Baroque, or Renaissance church, accepting the same relativist theory that also destroyed secular art giving way to the intricate jungle of horrors that is today contemporary art. And forgetting almost by accident all the valuable Thomistic philosophy of beauty, which orbits around a central idea: Beauty is the splendor of truth. Otherwise, whatever is born ugly dies much uglier and loses all its attractiveness (if it every managed to muster any) as soon as the novelty wears off. Thus, the churches built at the end of the 20th century to the new canons of urban ugliness are today remnants from a time when the current crisis of the Church was only just beginning. Today almost no one doubts that it is necessary to create a beautiful environment that moves hearts to worship God: with inspiring architecture, deeply religious art, and even respect for the liturgy, which is generally under ever less abuse from the revolutionary priests from the ’70s and ’80s. Of course, other aesthetic evils remain associated to our faith. Churches that neglect the liturgical vestments of the priest, monasteries devoid of monks, existing exclusively as tourist attractions, or the using of churches for activities completely unrelated to prayer and adoration. By the way, in my parish, yesterday, next to a beautiful image of the Immaculate Conception, the parish priest hung a horrible, huge poster vindicating the importance of recycling plastic; I admit that it moved me to prayer … but for God’s forgiveness for the priest. Privately, older priests in the most traditionally Catholic countries in the West speak of their sadness at their inability to attract young people. The truth is that certain parishes, certain religious movements, do manage to attract them. And they are not exactly the most groundbreaking, revolutionary, noisy, modern Catholic movements. So I sometimes take the trouble to explain to those sad priests, with as much charity and fraternal love as I can, that all the aesthetic transformation attempted by the Church in recent decades has failed for one reason only: Young people, whatever the media may say, are still attracted today by the same things they have always been attracted by, righteousness, truth and beauty. Which is incidentally also the path that leads to God. We should all read more of Colombian writer Nicolás Gómez Dávila, who expresses in one line what others of us need pages to say: “If we want something to last, let’s make it beautiful, not efficient.” Translated by Joel Dalmau.

"2","“I get emotionally down with the short days and feel like hibernating,” says Annabel Lagasse. So she gets on her bicycle and heads up the hill to London’s Hampstead Heath, where the Winter Swimmers Club meets by a natural pond, come rain or shine; when we spoke in December the water, was 39 degrees Fahrenheit. Lagasse describes swimming in near-freezing water as visceral and sensual: “It’s an exciting shock. Afterward, you feel that calm, and a greater alertness too.” There’s nothing like the dim light in the depths of winter to make us feel like we’re really just plants: We seek out the sun and wither without it. At its most serious, that moody winter tiredness is called seasonal affective disorder (SAD) , which the Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) lists as “Major Depressive Disorder with Seasonal Pattern.” The symptoms are similar to regular depression: sadness, loss of energy, difficulty concentrating, and hopelessness. But SAD has a few unique features too: an extreme desire for sleep, strong cravings for carbohydrates, and it’s strictly seasonal: SAD disappears entirely in spring. According to the American Psychiatry Association, up to 5 percent of people experience clinical SAD, which lasts about 40 percent of the year. Additionally, 10 percent to 20 percent get a milder version more fitting of the term “winter blues,” called subsyndromal SAD. Lagasse’s pond mornings have become a beloved ritual: “When it’s cold, dark, and wet, you think you don’t want to go, but often it’s worse in your head than it actually is.” This is why experts recommend pushing yourself out the door in winter, to get the benefits of bright morning light . A course of SAD-specific cognitive behavioral therapy can also be very effective. You should always see a doctor if you’re struggling — SAD responds to antidepressants and can be every bit as serious as any mental health condition. Scientists are still uncovering how SAD works, but the key is light. “SAD has been linked to the shortage of daylight,” says Timo Partonen , research professor at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. In addition to sunlight, bright artificial light can be used for treatment — Partonen explains that you might be able to lessen the symptoms of SAD if you start using a light box omitting at least 10,000 lux a couple of weeks before symptoms tend to start. Just make sure to get in front of it before 10 am: “It should be at least five mornings a week, up to one hour each time,” says Partonen. Eight out of 10 people who have SAD see good results from light therapy , which has been found to reduce the amount of melatonin secreted into the bloodstream. In the US, SAD increases the farther north you go: 1 percent of people in Florida and 9 percent in Alaska have SAD. But Europe is different: Partonen says that while only 1 percent to 2 percent of Central and Southern Europeans have SAD , there’s a lot more subsyndromal SAD : “In the Nordic countries, a larger portion of the population has milder SAD symptoms ,” says Partonen, explaining that subsyndromal SAD is probably a physiological reaction, affecting people whose bodies are sensitive to light. “But when it comes to [full] SAD you also need to have a predisposition to depression.” There’s nothing like the dim light in the depths of winter to make us feel like we’re really just plants Light is crucial because of how it impacts the body clock. Your circadian rhythm doesn’t just impact alertness, but everything from blood pressure and glucose release to memory consolidation at night — all things that could impact your mental state. Russell Foster , head of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at the University of Oxford, says we still don’t understand the fundamental causes of SAD. “In harsh winter conditions, we want to snuggle in, we want to conserve energy,” he says, “but is that driven by biology, or is it a social phenomenon?” While SAD makes you tired, extra sleep isn’t restorative because what you really need is light. Foster, also the author of Life Time: Your Body Clock and Its Essential Roles in Good Health and Sleep , explains that we’re most sensitive to light at dusk and dawn — while light at lunchtime is nice, it hardly does anything to ground your body clock. “Dog owners are supposed to have lower rates of depression,” says Foster, who thinks the reason is clear: “You have to get out of bed and take them for a walk, and you get the morning light!” Attitude matters too when it comes to SAD. “Developing new thought patterns can change the wiring in your brain,” says Kathryn Roecklein , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. While trauma can cause depression in part because it changes our physiology, it works both ways: Positive habits can change our physiology as well. Cecilia Blomdahl documents her life on Svalbard, a Norwegian island close to the North Pole. Photo courtesy of Cecilia Blomdahl Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD might work for up to 70 percent of people, says Roecklein. While general CBT aims to change unhelpful thinking about the self, SAD CBT focuses on thoughts and behaviors unique to winter. “A lot of people with winter depression have summer, spring, and fall activities they really enjoy [and miss]. One approach is to [find] winter activities that are similarly enjoyable, social, and maybe include physical activity,” says Roecklein. So if you can’t go cycling in winter, you could snowboard instead, and if you miss the heat, you could go to a steam room. Any CBT-trained therapist can create a SAD program; Roecklein recommends Kelly Rohan’s guide and workbook . Even if the arrival alongside the November gloom is a dead giveaway that it’s SAD, depression rarely exists in a vacuum. “If there are parts of your life that particularly bother you [when you have SAD] ... you might want to do some thinking, feeling, reconsidering,” says Jennifer Griesbach , a therapist in New York City and teacher at Gestalt Associates for Psychotherapy . While no one actually wants to be moody and Netflix -bound for months every year, self-care for SAD can start to feel like going against nature. After all, seasonality is only natural , and bears in hibernation don’t drag themselves to spin class. “This is a problem not just with SAD, but of living in the 21st century,” says Griesbach. “How do we work with the difference between what society wants for us and what our bodies want?” Griesbach recommends experimentation and paying close attention to how we feel afterward: “Sometimes you need to go to bed early, and sometimes you need to go out. It’s hard to tell the difference, but we can get better at it.” While SAD makes you tired, extra sleep isn’t restorative because what you really need is light Chasing the light isn’t the only way to enjoy winter. Darkness is truly magical for Cecilia Blomdahl , whose YouTube channel documents her life on Svalbard, a Norwegian island close to the North Pole that experiences two and a half months of darkness during polar night . “I look forward to polar night like a kid looks forward to Christmas,” says Blomdahl, who left her native Sweden eight years ago. “I see this as a season to slow down and appreciate the serenity the darkness brings. There’s so much beauty in the darkness.” Try a different approach — “feeling like it” isn’t required to enjoy winter. Photo courtesy of Cecilia Blomdahl Blomdahl admits polar night comes with challenges: “There’s nothing telling your body to wake up, so naturally, all I want to do is sleep!” A wake-up light helps, as does sticking to healthy routines. Blomdahl learned that in 2021, during one particularly tough polar night: “I’d just started my own business and was very stressed, and didn’t have a good routine at all. That really showed me the importance of a good sleep schedule and prioritizing things that make me feel good, like exercise and being outdoors.” If the idea of strong-arming yourself to be active when your body just wants to cosplay as a couch cushion still just feels plain wrong, you might be intrigued to learn that even for people who don’t have SAD, “feeling like it” isn’t required to enjoy winter. “Last night I went outside at 6 pm and it was 14°F. You do have to force yourself,” says Trude Witzell , a photographer living in Trondheim, Norway. “Of course, after dinner, you just want to go to bed when it’s cold and dark like this!” (This interview was conducted in Norwegian and has been translated into English by the author.) Hibernation isn’t the solution; researchers were confident about this, as we’re creatures driven by light . Winter requires many of us to work a little harder, though. SAD can make it difficult to tell whether we should be pushing ourselves out the door for a bundled-up morning walk across a frosty park, or if this is the night for lighting a candle while reading under a blanket. But we can use this slightly more difficult season to learn how to listen to ourselves and do what will truly make us feel good. Most evenings, Witzell heads down to the fjord for a swim, often in the dark because at midwinter, the sun sets at 2:30 pm: “It’s incredible to lie back and look at the dark sky.” Norwegians have a saying, dørstokkmila, meaning the doorstep mile, that is especially relevant this time of year: “The hardest step to take is the one out your front door.” Trude Witzell heads down to the fjord for a swim in Trondheim, Norway.

"2","Throughout her career but particularly over the last decade, Jennifer Lopez has earned the title of one of the busiest people in the entertainment industry. From performing at the Super Bowl halftime show to churning out rom- com after rom-com to repurposing “Let’s Get Loud” at a presidential inauguration and headlining a Las Vegas residency, the multihyphenate is truly everything everywhere. It only makes sense that she would tax herself with a superfluous three-part project revamping one of her highest-performing albums, 2002’s This Is Me… Then — not even during its anniversary, by the way — all of which essentially serves to emphasize her persisting dominance in pop culture. (And oh yeah, her current state of bliss with her husband, Ben Affleck.) The first part of this trifecta, which includes a forthcoming documentary and a new album out today, is the Prime Video movie This Is Me… Now: A Love Story . The trippy musical isn’t the sort of high-brow, experimental venture one might expect from a pop star of Lopez’s caliber (think more like a wacky Marvel film than Beyoncé’s Lemonade ). If anything , This Is Me… Now is a confirmation of the singer/actress’s elite showmanship and her ability to bounce back as a cultural figure and chronic divorcée. It’s exactly the sort of galaxy-brained project one makes when one has nothing to prove and $20 million to spend — and one is high on love. This Is Me… Now is a messy, green-screen fantasia — but to what end? From the moment the movie trailer dropped on social media, This Is Me… Now seemed primed for jokes about Lopez’s theater-kid-level earnestness and whatever Oscar-winner Ben Affleck planned on doing in the film. (He’s almost unrecognizable as a rambunctious news anchor, in addition to a few other cameos.) On one hand, it is obvious meme material. We’re talking about Lopez here, who has largely opted for maximalism over subtlety as a performer. (This is a woman who inserted a pole-dancing routine from her role in Hustlers into a Super Bowl halftime show, after all.) And as the star of a slew of romantic comedies ( Maid in Manhattan , The Wedding Planner , Second Act , Marry Me ), she’s no stranger to reveling in cheesiness. That being said, the semi-autobiographical movie relies a lot on big metaphors and unsubtle imagery. For example, in a dream sequence, Lopez’s heart is represented by a giant, combustible apparatus operated by dancing factory workers and fueled by rose petals. But it somehow feels right from the brain of such an iconic Leo, known for wearing her heart on her sleeve. The hour-long movie opens with Lopez reciting the Puerto Rican myth of Alida and Taroo , two star-crossed lovers from rival tribes. After Alida’s father forbids their romance, Alida prays to the gods for help, who then turn her into a red flower. When Taroo asks the gods to help him find Alida, he is transformed into a hummingbird, leading him on a continual search for his one true love. If you’re fluent in the history of Bennifer and all the tabloid scrutiny that followed the first round of their relationship, you’ll see where all this allegory is going. But before Lopez can reunite with her Prince Charming, we’re taken on a fantastical musical odyssey through her tumultuous, star-studded romantic history. Directed by notable music video director Dave Meyers, the film is admittedly reminiscent of some of his later, less visually appealing work — from the overly glossy, video-game-like sheen to the depressingly gray-and- amber Zack Snyder look of the film. The constantly rotating, borderline nauseating camera angles brought to mind his unfortunate collaborations with Ariana Grande. Jennifer Lopez holding flowers in This Is Me... Now: A Love Story . Courtesy of Prime Video In slightly more grounded moments— if you could describe any part of this film as grounded — Lopez is able to overcome a vexing amount of green screen to convey something real and exciting. In one particularly fun number where she reimagines her three ill-fated marriages, she adds new life to the otherwise middling single “Can’t Get Enough.” In arguably the movie’s most powerful scene, she makes amends with her younger self for putting men before her personal happiness. This is also where she performs the title track “This Is Me… Now,” a standout on an album that doesn’t seem to be brimming with hits. Of course, Lopez’s penchant for astrology is included throughout the film. One of the funniest and most enjoyable aspects is the Zodiac Love Council, who struggle to match Lopez with her one true love. The astrological gods are played by a random but somehow pitch-perfect ensemble of celebrities including Lopez’s Monster-In-Law co-star Jane Fonda, rapper-singer Post Malone, actress Sofia Vergara, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, America’s sweetheart Keke Palmer, comedian Trevor Noah, screen legend Jennifer Lewis, and hyper-pop singer Kim Petras. Oddly enough, these supporting characters have more chemistry than you might expect and are as committed to the bit as Lopez is — and really, isn’t commitment the most you can ask for from an overstuffed vanity project? The movie isn’t as confessional as you may think This Is Me… Now is more disorienting than revelatory. The fast-paced, CGI-on-steroids element feels like a purposeful distraction from the fact that viewers will not learn anything about Lopez’s love life and psyche that she hasn’t been open about before. If you haven’t noticed, she and Affleck have been extremely public about their rekindling. Since reuniting in April 2021, the two have posed on numerous red carpets together, gushed over each other in interviews , starred in Dunkin’ commercials, and even recreated a moment from the “Jenny From the Block” music video on a yacht for paparazzi. The therapy scenes between Lopez and fellow Bronxite Fat Joe are almost entirely played for laughs, revealing nothing novel, despite a perfect opportunity in the film for deeper introspection. Plus, the narrative explored in This Is Me… Now feels similar to many of her albums exploring her mishaps in love, including Love?, her 2011 comeback album. In her 2014 memoir True Love , she takes readers on the same self-love journey, investigating her regrettable approaches to her past relationships and what she describes as a tendency to mistake passion for genuine love. Even a striking sequence in the film where Lopez dances with a volatile partner inside a glass house isn’t particularly shocking, given that in her book, she writes about being “mentally, emotionally, verbally” abused by an unnamed ex. A raw, more transparent piece of art would likely confront the public’s treatment of her love life, given that the media’s ridicule and other external pressures , according to Lopez, were such a huge part of her and Affleck’s initial estrangement. It could at least include a few fun, lighthearted Easter eggs. Perhaps she’s saving more personal anecdotes for her documentary, The Greatest Love Story Never Told , out February 27, but This Is Me… Now seems like a prime vehicle for some juicy details about her past. This Is Me… Now is more about J. Lo’s power as a celebrity than an artist It’s a bit ironic that the thing Lopez’s character overcomes in this film — a need for external validation — is what seems to be driving its existence. It’s hard not to view the movie within the larger context of Hollywood failing to take her seriously as an actress, despite being one of the most bankable movie stars and turning over some genuinely good performances throughout her career. For example, Lopez has been open about the disappointment that was her failed Oscars campaign for the 2019 movie Hustlers , even capturing her tears during nominations morning in her Netflix documentary Jennifer Lopez: Halftime . While the actress earned other big awards nominations that year, including for the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes — she already has a Golden Globe nomination for the 1997 film Selena — the Hollywood establishment seems hesitant to see her as much more than a commercial star. Such treatment has presumably caused her to feel like an “ outsider ” in Hollywood. Regardless, it’s hard to point to a moment in time since her breakthrough in the late ‘90s when Lopez’s name has not been in the public conversation, whether for her personal life or professional ventures. Even initially questionable film and television roles, like starring in the NBC cop show Shades of Blue or lending her voice to the Ice Age franchise, now feel like necessary stepping stones in her trajectory. For instance, despite having a spotty, often poorly reviewed filmography, her choices in projects — particularly rom-coms and two-handers — have at least contributed to her specific brand as a movie star. Fans know what to expect from a classic J. Lo movie. It’s why she can star in a chaotic, objectively bad rom-com, like 2022’s Shotgun Wedding, without any expectations beyond being generally entertaining and delivering nostalgia. The same resilience and ingenuity can be seen in her bumpy music career, which saw a downturn in 2007 following the release of her Spanish-language album Como Ama una Mujer and her return-to- pop-R&B; album Brave . Her decision to judge American Idol in 2011 — a surprising gig for a pop star at her level of fame — gave her a platform to regain the country’s interest as well as advertise new music. Plus, her Las Vegas residency, All I Have , from 2016 to 2018 would also set the stage for a revival of her musical catalog. All in all, Lopez’s career has demonstrated reinvention and, more importantly, redemption that not many can emulate. Her determination is, of course, the result of a celebrity culture that enjoys building women up until they’re deemed past their prime. For women of color, this cycle can be more brutal. Nevertheless, it’s historically resulted in some of our most fascinating divas and pop cultural stories. This Is Me… Now is a statement of Lopez’s cultural resilience, if not just her ability to rebound from a bad relationship and find herself in another attention-grabbing power couple. She’s the kind of celebrity who can make sense out of any creative decision, including funding a self-important long-form music video based on her therapy sessions. There’s a level of shamelessness (and megalomania) required in crafting a movie like this, but it’s the sort of unabashed confidence that makes our celebrity ecosystem go round.

"2","One of the things that human beings seem to fear is uncertainty. Most of us like to know things, and when we don’t know things, we get uncomfortable. And when we’re forced to face the unknown, our response is often to retreat into old ideas and routines. Why is that? What’s so unnerving about ambiguity? Maggie Jackson is a journalist and the author of a delightful new book called Uncertain: The Wisdom and Wonder of Being Unsure . It makes a great case for uncertainty as a philosophical virtue, but it also uses the best research we have to explain why embracing uncertainty primes us for learning and can improve our overall mental health. So I invited her onto The Gray Area recently to talk about what she’s learned and how to think about it in our practical lives. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. As always, there’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts , Google Podcasts , Spotify , Stitcher , or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday. Sean Illing How did you come to this topic? Maggie Jackson Reluctantly, to be honest. This is my third book. I’ve been writing about topics that are right under our noses, that we don’t understand or that we deeply misunderstand. The first book was about the nature of home in the digital age. The second book was about distraction, but particularly attention, which very few people could define. And then finally I started writing a book about thinking in the digital age and the first chapter was about uncertainty. And not only did I discover uncertainty hadn’t really been studied or acknowledged, but there’s now this new attention to it. Lots and lots of new research findings, even in psychology. But I was still reluctant. Like many people, I had this idea that it was just something to eradicate, that uncertainty is something to get beyond, and shut it down as fast as possible. Sean Illing So what’s beneath our near-universal fear of the unknown? Maggie Jackson As human beings, we dislike uncertainty for a real reason. We need and want answers. And this unsettling feeling we have is our innate way of signaling that we’re not in the routine anymore. And so it’s really important to understand, in some ways, how rare and wonderful uncertainty is. At the same time, we also need routine and familiarity. Most of life is what scientists call predictive processing. That is, we’re constantly making assumptions and predicting. You just don’t think that your driveway is going to be in a different place when you get home tonight. You can expect that you know how to tie your shoelaces when you get up in the morning. We’re enmeshed in this incredible world of our assumptions. It’s so human, and so natural, to stick to routine and to have that comfort. If everything was always new, if we had to keep learning everything again, we’d be in real trouble. But neuroscientists are beginning to unpack what happens in the brain when we deal with the stress of uncertainty. The uncertainty of the moment, the realization that you don’t know, that you’ve reached the limits of your knowledge, instigate a number of neural changes. Your focus broadens, and your brain becomes more receptive to new data, and your working memory is bolstered. Which is why facing uncertainty is a kind of wakefulness. In fact, Joseph Kable of the University of Pennsylvania said to me, “That’s the moment when your brain is telling itself there’s something to be learned here.” Sean Illing We can think of uncertainty as a precursor to good thinking, and I suppose it is. But that makes it sound a little too much like a passive state, as opposed to an active orientation to the world. Do you think of uncertainty as something closer to a disposition? Maggie Jackson Uncertainty is definitively a disposition. We each have our personal comfort zone when it come to uncertainty, and our impression is that uncertainty is static, that it’s synonymous with paralysis. But when you take up that opportunity to learn the good stress that uncertainty offers you, you actually slow down — there are less snap judgments, you’re not racing to an answer. Uncertainty, in other words, involves a process, and that’s really, really important. The way we think of experts is a good example. We venerate the swaggering kind of expert who knows what to do, whose know-how was developed over the so-called 10,000 hours of experience. But that type of expertise needs updating. That type of expert’s knowledge tends to fall short when facing new, unpredictable, ambiguous problems — the kind of problems that involve or demand uncertainty. So years of experience are actually only weakly correlated with skill and accuracy in medicine and finance. People who are typical routine experts fall into something called carryover mode, where they’re constantly applying their old knowledge, the old heuristic shortcut solutions, to new situations, and that’s when they fail. Adaptive experts actually explore a problem. Sean Illing The idea that not knowing can be a strength does intuitively seem like a contradiction. Maggie Jackson Knowledge is incredibly important. It’s the foundation and the groundwork. But at the same time, we need to update our understanding of knowledge and understand that knowledge is mutable and dynamic. People who are intolerant of uncertainty think of knowledge as something like a rock that we are there to hold and defend, whereas people who are more tolerant of uncertainty are more likely to be curious, flexible thinkers. I like to say that they treat knowledge as a tapestry whose mutability is its very strength. Sean Illing I doubt anyone would argue that ignorance is a virtue, but openness to revising our beliefs is definitely a virtue, and that’s the distinction here. Maggie Jackson It’s really important to note that uncertainty is not ignorance. Ignorance is the blank slate. In child development, there’s an expression called the zone of proximal development, which is usually used as a shorthand for scaffolding. That’s the place where a child is pushing beyond their usual knowledge, they’re trying something complex and new and the parent might scaffold a little bit and help only where necessary, but letting them do the work of expanding their limits. But that’s something we do throughout our whole lives. That zone of proximal development, as one scientist told me, is the green bud on the tree. That’s where we want to be. That’s where we thrive as thinkers and as people. Sean Illing When does uncertainty become paralyzing? Maggie Jackson Forward motion involves choices. Uncertainty is never the end goal. It’s more like a vehicle and an approach to life. Most of the time it’s our fear of uncertainty that leads to paralysis. It’s not the uncertainty itself. If we approach uncertainty knowing it’s a space of possibilities, or as another psychologist told me, an opportunity for movement, then we can be present in the moment and start investigating and exploring. But if we’re afraid of uncertainty, we’re more likely to treat it as a threat. And if we’re more tolerant of uncertainty, we treat it as a challenge. Sean Illing You cite some research about fear of the unknown as at least one of the root causes of things like anxiety and depression. It certainly makes intuitive sense, but what do we know about that relationship? Maggie Jackson This is a very new but rising theoretical understanding of mental challenges in the psychology world. More and more psychologists and clinicians are beginning to see fear of the unknown as the trans-diagnostic root, or at least a vulnerability factor, to conditions like PTSD and anxiety. But by narrowing down treatments to just helping people bolster their tolerance of uncertainty, they’re beginning to find that might be a really important way to shift intractable anxiety. There’s one gold-standard peer- reviewed study by probably one of the world’s greatest experts on anxiety, Michel Dugas. He found that people who were taught simple strategies to try on uncertainty, their intractable anxiety went down. It also helped their depression. And then other studies with multiple different kinds of populations show that focused strategies about uncertainty boost self-reported resilience in patients with multiple sclerosis, who are dealing with a lot of medical uncertainty. Sean Illing It’s just a fact of life that things will change and the world won’t conform to our wishes, and so I feel like we end up going one of two ways: We either embrace the limits of our knowledge or we distort the world in order to make it align with our story of it, and I think bad things happen when we do the latter. Maggie Jackson That’s right. I think it’s also backbreaking work to continually retreat into our certainties and close our eyes to the mutability of the world. I had a real epiphany when I was doing some writing about a Head Start program that teaches people from very challenged backgrounds, both parents and preschoolers, to pause and reflect throughout their very chaotic days. And it seems like something that doesn’t have much to do with uncertainty, but they were basically inhabiting the question even though it was a very difficult thing to snatch these moments of reflection within their lives. In parallel to that, there’s a lot of new movement to understand the strengths of people who live in lower economic situations that are often chaotic. What was amazing to me is that I realized how much I grew up expecting that stability and predictability was just an entitlement. That this is the way we should live, that this is the skill set you need to adapt in order to thrive. Many of us have airbrushed out of our psyches the ability to live in precarious situations. Sean Illing So when someone is confronted with the feeling of fear that comes with not knowing, how should they sit with that? What’s your practical advice? Maggie Jackson Well, first, you can remind yourself that this is your body and brain’s way of signaling that there’s a moment when the status quo won’t do. That this might be uncomfortable, but it’s not a situation or a state of mind that prevents forward progress — it’s actually propelling you forward. It’s truly changed my life writing this book, and it’s taken away a little bit of the fear that I might carry into new situations — from giving a speech to being in the presence of someone who’s very upset. I used to want to just offer a solution, and give that silver lining, and get that moment over with and get them on the road to happiness. And now I feel much more patient. And with that comes the ability to follow a path down an unexpected road, or even take a detour.

"1","T he highly regarded Pew Research Center has released its latest analysis of the religious beliefs of Americans and consequently acquired its usual major media headlines. The Washington Post version led: “nones — nonreligious Americans — increasing in U.S.” National Public Radio announced: “nones are now the largest group in the U.S.,” ahead of “Catholics and Evangelicals.” As usual, the facts were somewhat more complex than the media reported. The Pew report itself shows that most nones are not necessarily nonreligious. And Pew’s reported percent of nones had actually declined marginally since 2019, (although it has increased substantially over 50 years ). At 28 percent, nones were marginally larger than the 26 percent of Evangelicals or 25 percent of Catholics. But this is well below the 40 percent of all Protestants, much less the 60 percent of Christians, or 70 percent of all with a formal religion. (READ MORE from Donald Devine: Does Economic Recession Loom in Our Future?) Pew actually created its “nones” category by combining three separate groups even to arrive at the 28 percent total: 17 percent of this group actually defined themselves as atheists, 20 percent as agnostics, and 63 percent (or only 18 percent of the grand total) as “Nothing in Particular;” that is, as not affiliated with any specific religion. But the first two groups are quite different, having very specific belief histories opposing religion, while Pew concedes that the “nothings” have extremely complex, not especially nonreligious ideas about it. For example, while atheists and agnostics mostly reject the idea of God or a higher power, only a third of the “nothing in particulars” do so. In its main summary section, Pew reports its results for all the “nones” groups together against those “affiliated” with all traditional religions, which naturally became the focus for the mass media reports on it. Actually, the full Pew report included eight other separate chapters with more detailed breakdowns of the separate nones groups, which will be discussed below. But Pew’s main summary report itself is sufficient to refute the progressive decline-of-religion theme emphasized by the mainstream media. Right at the beginning of its main report, Pew’s summary of results reads: Most “nones” believe in God or another higher power. But very few go to religious services regularly. Most say religion does some harm, but many also think it does some good. They are not uniformly anti -religious. Most “nones” reject the idea that science can explain everything. But they express more positive views of science than religiously affiliated Americans do. This summary alone shows that the mainstream media substantially erred by simply headlining the nones as nonreligious. Pew did also say that “many [nones] are critical of religious institutions and are less participant in organizations generally,” and that, “ Most say religion causes a variety of problems in society — like intolerance or superstition.” But many “nones” also say that religion helps give people meaning and purpose, and that it can encourage people to treat each other well. Overall, 43% of “nones” say religion does more harm than good in society, while 14% say it does more good than harm; 41% say religion does equal amounts of good and harm. The summary report added, 63% of “nones” say “there is something spiritual beyond the natural world, even if we cannot see it.” And 56% of “nones” say there are some things that science just can’t explain … About half of nones say spirituality is very important in their lives or say they think of themselves as spiritual. On the claim that nones substitute rational science for religion, Pew reported, Most “nones” say science does more good than harm in American society, and on average “nones” are much more positive about science than are religiously affiliated people. At the same time, most “nones” believe there are limits to what science can do. For example, 44% of “nones” say there is a scientific explanation for everything, while 56% say there are some things science can’t possibly explain. Clearly, the mainstream media’s pro nones-bias led it astray. But the Pew report itself confused things by burdening the “nothings” (as we call the “nothing in particulars” by themselves) to carry the burden of the atheists and agnostics within the broader “nones” category. By adding them to the nones, Pew makes the “nothings” appear substantially more anti- religious and progressive-liberal than they actually are. For, with atheists at 17 percent of the nones category and agnostics at 20 percent, this represents almost 40 percent of the “nones” reported beliefs, which are often quite different than what the “nothings in particular” alone believe. (READ MORE: Thank Media’s Toxic Culture Wars for Today’s Universal Unhappiness ) It is reported, for example, that 70 percent of nones believe in God or a higher power. But 77 percent of atheists do not believe in either, suppressing the fact that 83 percent of nothings by themselves do believe, putting nothings right at the U.S. national average. Or, when asked if there is “something spiritual beyond the natural world even if we cannot see it,” or, instead, whether “the natural world is all there is,” 75 percent of atheists say there is only this world. But 75 percent of nothings say there is a world beyond. When asked if humans have a soul or spirit beyond their bodily existence, the nones total is misleadingly increased by the fact 69 percent of atheists say humans do not have such a spirit — while 78 percent of nothings say they do. Only 4 percent of atheists and 18 percent of agnostics believe in Heaven compared to 51 percent of nothings who do. Even 41 percent of nothings believe in a Hell, compared to merely 13 percent of agnostics and 3 percent of atheists. In evaluating the overall effect of religion, 73 percent of atheists say religion does more harm than good, as do 51 percent of agnostics. But only 33 percent of nothings choose religion “does more harm than good.” Nones views on science replacing religion are similarly distorted. When asked to choose between the belief that “there is a scientific explanation for everything even if we do not understand how everything works,” and the statement that “there are some things science cannot possibly explain” — 78 percent of atheists and 54 percent of agnostics but only 31 percent of nothings choose the science explanation for everything. Actually, 68 percent of nothings chose the more religious, limited-science ability to explain everything. The Pew Center and its impressive surveys represent an invaluable resource for understanding world and U.S. public opinion. Its reports have been essential for my own understanding as a longtime political scientist writing on policy and public opinion. Pew’s “nones” concept has been incredibly successful in attracting popular media to its resources and conclusions. But as its own more detailed chapter data demonstrate, the nones concept has been pushed too far. The term “nothings” is probably not the answer either but the conceptual separation of atheists and agnostics from whatever might replace it is essential. As an old survey data analyst, I understand the desire to increase the size of public opinion subset categories; but Pew’s own chapter data make the case that they should be separate categories. Earlier Pew analysis had shown that “nothings” may even switch back and forth to religion over time, suggesting some dynamic between them, while atheism and agnosticism clearly deserve their own separate designations.

"1","A s Vladimir Putin talked to Tucker Carlson about the “Russian soul” last week, his troops were breaking through Ukrainian defenses in a key sector of the besieged city of Avdiivka, which has become the latest pivotal battle of the war. When Putin agreed to give the interview seen by millions around the world, he may have known that his intelligence services were dusting off Soviet era maps showing a pipeline close to Russian positions, through which “Spetnaz” could crawl into the city center. A specially selected “storm” unit composed of Wagner group veterans, now incorporated into the regular Russian army, managed to sneak up behind some Ukrainian positions and catch them by surprise. Their collapse allowed an advance into the destroyed city neighborhood by Russian troops whose siege has lasted four months, at a cost of over 20,000 casualties, 300 main battle tanks, and thousands more combat vehicles and artillery pieces. Ukraine’s highly pressured position in Avdiivka was causing simmering disagreements between president Volodymir Zelensky and elements of his military high command arguing for a tactical withdrawal to more defensible fortified lines 16 miles west of the city. The Russian breakthrough brought matters to a head and Zelensky replaced the chief of his armed forces, General Valery Zalushny, with the more aggressive general Oleksandr Syrsky, signaling his continued refusal to concede territory to Russia — even as Putin was telling Tucker that he would negotiate peace once “Russian objectives are met.” With the capture of Avdiivka, Russia can solidify its central front and move towards the industrial heartland of the Donbass, Kromatorsk, an engineering hub with a population of over 100,000, steel plants, iron mines, and gas fields. It would be Russia’s biggest strategic prize since launching its invasion two years ago and may be central in any future peace discussions. (READ MORE from Martin Arostegui: Putin’s March to the Red Sea ) Upon taking his new command, Syrsky committed key reserves to reinforce positions in Avdiivka including the crack 3 rd Brigade freshly trained in American M1A1 Abrams tanks which started arriving last October. Any relief effort would involve sharp armored thrusts to counter Russia’s pincer movement to surround the city from the north and south, in order to secure its western supply route that Russian forces have almost cut off in recent days. It was Syrsky’s strategy when he directed the defense of Bahamut last winter and Russia will probably fall back on the attritional tactics its so far used to capture cities with its numerically superior army; flooding in troops from all directions to overwhelm the defenders. Ukraine has advantages it lacked last year. It’s much enhanced armored capabilities — including the Abrams, British Challenger tanks, German Leopards, as well as hundreds of U.S. Bradley fighting vehicles and German Marders that keep arriving in steady numbers — more than match refurbished vintage T-55 and T62s with which Russia is largely replacing modern T-72s, T-80s, and T-90s being destroyed in great numbers. Ukraine has vastly increased its drone capabilities with domestic mass production of copies of Iranian Shahed 136 and Russian Lancet FPVs, that they use with lethal effect against artillery positions. Defense contractors are even working on jet powered loitering munitions to throw against strategic targets inside of Russia, such as oil and gas refineries hit in the most recent attacks. Ukraine has also greatly expanded its electronic warfare capabilities, significantly catching up to Russia in this critical area. According to Ukrainian defense spokesmen, EW equipment is now being distributed to field units down to company level to disrupt swarms of enemy drones by interfering with the signals from their operators. Zelensky and his newly appointed high command may be hoping to hold off the Russians long enough for the 40 to 60 American F-16s, committed by European NATO allies, to get in theatre and give Ukraine some tactical air superiority to push the Russians back from Avdiivka and possibly rout their 50,000 strong force concentrated there. Gen. Syrsky routed the Russian invasion force of 100,000 trying to take Kyiv two years ago. (READ MORE: Zelensky Responds to Putin’s Missile War) Russia may even be planning for such a worst case scenario. It’s erected a barrier of over 2000 freight wagons along a 30 mile stretch of railroad east of the Avdiivka called “ Tsar Train” which analysts believe is intended as a barricade against Ukrainian forces that may pursue a retreating army into occupied lands. Pictures of F-16s with Ukranian markings are already circulating on social media but the planes are probably still in Romania or other countries where pilots are undergoing training. Their highly complex instruction has a way to go yet, according to experts like retired British air vice marshal Sean Bell who told Times Radio that it will be “several months to a year” before the pilots are combat ready. Zelensky is taking a huge gamble in Avdiivka. Success much depends on whether a previously rejected $62 billion military aid package that was finally approved by the US Senate this week makes it past the House of Representatives where Republican Speaker Mike Johnson says it’s “dead on arrival.” Despite pledging to defend Ukraine at any cost, the Biden administration refuses to adopt measures to shut the U.S. border with Mexico proposed by Republicans who condition new aid for Zelensky on stemming the migrant “invasion” that’s a far bigger security concern for most Americans than Ukraine, according to polls. The European Union is trying to fill the void created by the cut throat power struggles between globalist democrats and isolationist republicans. After approving $55 billion in Ukraine aid last week, top EU officials have announced plans to step up supplies of 155 mm artillery shells of which Ukraine is critically short. Over 500,000 are being delivered next month , according to EU Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen. This falls way short of the one million artillery rounds sent to Russia by North Korea, but Europe’s chief commissioner says that EU countries will “coordinate efforts to draw from existing stocks and increase ammunition production” for further deliveries. Norway is also replenishing missiles for Ukraine’s NASAM medium range air defense systems which could run out by next month, according to the Pentagon. This other critical shortage could give Russia the window it needs to unleash its hypersonic missiles such as the X-22 also known as Kh-22, with speeds of up to 4,000 kph for a blitz that could dwarf anything suffered by Ukraine so far. (READ MORE: Russia Mounts Its Comeback ) “It’s impossible for Russia not to win” Putin told Tucker in their two hour interview and he could be proved right in Avdiivka. A growing sense of urgency is palpable in Europe where the prospect of a Russian victory is finally forcing governments to step up military preparedness as Donald Trump pushed them to do when he was president over scathing criticism from the liberal media and bureaucratic pundits. Europe’s military shortcomings and the currently fractured leadership in Washington make a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine seem inevitable at this point. The battle for Avdiivka may well decide whether Putin deals from a position of strength or from behind his “Tsar Train.”"
"1","Despite recent claims that the Academy Awards excluded women from coveted categories — claims made by none other than # Hillary Barbie — the nominations suggest an unprecedented appreciation of films made by or for women. Sure, Barbie’s Greta Gerwig is missing from Best Director, but four out of ten Best Picture nominees are female-centric films. The one topping nominations, director Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things, is a subject of fascination. By nominating Poor Things for 11 awards, the Academy has implicitly endorsed the vision of womanhood in a film true to Mary Shelley’s source material . In grafting the Sexual Revolution onto Victorian England, Poor Things , like Frankenstein , creates a frightening amalgam. Though the characters are hedonistic, the film itself is secretly prudish. If Poor Things wins big at the March awards show, then the Academy will, perhaps unwittingly, embrace a return to traditional values. (READ MORE from Shelby Kearns: Let Kids Drop Out: Why Compulsory Education Harms Even the Most Gifted Students ) On its surface, Poor Things celebrates women’s sexual freedom through its heroine, Bella Baxter (Emma Stone). Bella is the creation of Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe), or “God,” and the pair reside in a futuristic Victorian England. She has an infant’s brain in a woman’s body, so Godwin charts her progress as her motor skills and cognition rapidly shift from child to woman. To control the experiment’s variables, Godwin gives Bella a cloistered existence in his home and lab, making her a blank slate unshaped by social convention. Before Bella is even mature enough to consent to marriage, Godwin promises her to his sensitive apprentice Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef) — one of her few contacts with the outside world. The marriage plans are thwarted by Godwin’s lawyer, Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a dandy who takes after Shelley’s friend, Lord Byron . With prurient intentions, Wedderburn invites Bella on his travels, and she eagerly accepts to see what life is like outside the Godwin home. As Wedderburn and Bella traverse colorful, steampunk versions of Lisbon, Alexandria, and Marseille, the result of Godwin’s experiment is revealed. Godwin never poses this question, but the film seems to ask the audience, “What would women be like if they weren’t controlled by men?” One reading suggests that the uninhibited woman would have sex like a man. Bella has such an appetite that it even surprises Wedderburn, whose confessions suggest that he doesn’t stay with anyone longer than three months. Wedderburn is so intrigued with Bella that he decides to marry her, but to his chagrin, she takes on additional partners. What follows is a lengthy second act of sex scene after sex scene. Poor Thing’s supposed celebration of Bella’s sexual freedom has polarized critics. One review in Slate sees “a kinky delight,” while Vulture’s Angelica Jade Bastién considers the sex scenes part of a male fantasy — albeit one with admirable craft — that gazes upon Bella’s body with no interest in her interior life. Though the takes in Slate and Vulture diverge, they share an assumption: Poor Things conflates sexual experience and enlightenment. Bastien says as much when she notes the transition from black and white to full color, perhaps a stylistic choice showing that Bella is in the dark until shrugging off sexual restraint. What the critics miss, however, is a searing indictment of the Sexual Revolution. The look and feel of Poor Things imply that not all Bella’s choices are good, and they’re not all her own. Like other Lanthimos films, Poor Things evokes the uncanny, disgust, and what young people call “cringe” through wide-angle lenses, a dissonant score, and shots exposing the body’s every nook and cranny. In other words, sexual freedom can be ugly. Those encouraging Bella’s appetite reveal their self- interest, including the brothel owner who temporarily employs Bella and tells her that “[a] woman planting her own course to freedom” is “delightful.” It reminds one, for example, of how late Playboy founder Hugh Hefner supported birth control and abortion, as Louise Perry astutely observed in The Case Against the Sexual Revolution. People who support casual sex without consequences often have something to gain, including, in Hefner’s case , a steady supply of girlfriends 60 years his junior. (READ MORE: These Policies Could Help Vulnerable Women Who Are Turning to OnlyFans ) Poor Things , then, is arguably more evocative of Mary Wollstonecraft than Mary Shelley. Wollstonecraft, Shelley’s mother, has reentered the feminist imagination thanks to legal scholar Erika Bachiochi’s The Rights of Women: Reclaiming a Lost Vision (2021). Bachiochi argues for a return to the first wave of feminism ushered in by Wollstonecraft with her 1792 treatise A Vindication of the Rights of Women . Wollstonecraft’s feminism, Bachiochi writes, held men and women as equally rational and thus equally dignified. Contrary to the Sexual Revolution in the 1960s and the accompanying ideology of second-wave feminism, the equal rights of men and women didn’t exist so that women could act like the most vicious men. No, Wollstonecraft thought that equal rights enabled men and women to exercise equal virtue, helping both sexes fulfill familial obligations. In prioritizing the family, Wollenstonecraft hoped to forestall fatherlessness, a phenomenon that has risen to epidemic proportions. With its pro-family undercurrent, Poor Things makes a journey of its own from the third (fourth?) wave of feminism to the first. The film begins as a sex- positive Frankenstein but has an ending that would please Wollstonecraft. Yes, Bella makes unconventional choices, and the final scene shows her lounging on the lawn, clinking martini glasses with Toinette (Suzy Bemba), the friend and lover who she met at the brothel. However, Bella also makes a decision that’s radical in today’s anti-marriage culture: she retreats behind the walls of the Godwin home with her betrothed, Max. To paraphrase a Victorian concept , Bella is the angel with a crooked halo in the house. For all its raunch, Poor Things is most at ease with Bella’s quiet and relatively chaste domestic life. By the end, Lanthimos has dropped the warping camera lenses and replaced the grating score with a triumphant chorus . At last, Bella’s enlightenment has arrived. Poor Things ’ critical acclaim could mean that the Academy is similarly awakened to the problem with the Sexual Revolution: its false promises undermine marriage and family, the ultimate sources of happiness. If the film industry offers a glimpse into our culture, then Poor Things indicates that we’ve ridden this wave of feminism to its peak, and it’s about to come crashing down."
"1","Germany’s Catholic bishops may be preparing to defy the Vatican, despite Pope Francis’s efforts to rein in the heterodox prelates. The German Bishops’ Conference will meet tomorrow for its annual Spring plenary assembly, where the bishops may move forward with establishing a Synodal Council. Last year, as the German Synodal Way concluded, the idea of a Synodal Council was proposed, a permanent body of mostly laity who would democratically vote on matters ecclesial and administrative, replacing the authority of the bishop. The Vatican vehemently opposed and outright banned the creation of any such council, stating that the German bishops do not have the authority to contradict the ecclesial hierarchy of the universal Catholic Church. However, Bishop Georg Bätzing, the president of the German Bishops’ Conference, rejected the ban and announced that he would try to negotiate with the Vatican instead. Catholic laity in Germany are calling on their bishops to be obedient to Rome. The group Neuer Anfang (New Beginning) published an open letter to “once again express our concern for the course of the Church” in Germany. They wrote: [W]e would like to invite you — in a good biblical way — to take stock and see whether there is still something right about the overall “Synodal Way” project. The Pope and his Roman authorities have rejected almost all of their demands and decisions as incompatible with the teachings of the Church. Neuer Anfang noted that the Synodal Council and the Synodal Way have been “built on sand.” The Synodal Way was originally intended to be a means to address the “power structures” in the German Church which resulted in the clerical sexual abuse crisis. (READ MORE from S.A. McCarthy: Virginia’s Bishops Speak Out Against Euthanasia ) However, the program began operating under the misconception that the abuse was facilitated by the specifically and uniquely Catholic organization of the Church. Of course, as countless abuse crises and studies have demonstrated, abuse is not rooted in the Catholic Church: any organization which has hierarchical “power structures” is susceptible to abuse. Since the Synodal Way began operating on flawed and faulty principles, the creation of a Synodal Council, Neuer Anfang argued, is unnecessary and “cannot be reconciled with the sacramental structure of the Church.” “Why, dear bishops,” the laity asked, “do you openly disobey the Pope? … Who gives you, dear bishops, the right to renounce your apostolic authority based on the Gospel?” The letter notes that the bishops are wasting their time and energy on committees and meetings, neglecting their duty to shepherd their flocks. “Do you still notice that you, as courageous shepherds and bold leaders, are urgently needed somewhere else?” the laity asked in their letter. “There is war outside. The country is facing a demographic, economic, and social catastrophe. Germany is in danger of slipping into ungovernability. Hundreds of thousands of people are leaving their spiritual home disappointed — a Catholic Church that has lost its spiritual substance, its intellectual relevance and its prophetic luminosity.” “Lent is a time of examination of conscience, purification and new beginnings,” the letter concludes. “Nobody has to continue the old patterns. You as bishops don’t have to do that either. With the ‘bold freedom of speech’ that Cardinal Bergoglio called for the Church in 2013, we say to you: Bishops, be honest!” (READ MORE: Understanding Pope Francis’s Comments on Hell ) Currently, a “Synodal Committee” is preparing the way for the banned Synodal Council. The powerful Central Committee of German Catholics has already approved the statutes of the Synodal Council. If Germany’s bishops approve those statutes, too, the Church in Germany will officially be in schism and in direct defiance of the Roman Pontiff."
"1","T he very first command God gives to the first humans is to be fruitful and multiply. If there aren’t people, then there are no commandments and no wisdom, for who would be there to contemplate or to act? But with ongoing human life, everything else follows in time — so long as people continue to invest in those who will follow them. Our generation is doing the opposite — ringing up debt that will saddle those who come after us. If they come after us. For it has been evident for some time that humankind around the world has decided that it will observe the commandment about being fruitful and multiplying about as much as any of the other commandments — sporadically, as it may please us. We have known for some time that the replacement rate had been dropping. In 2011, David Goldman in his How Civilizations Die called our attention to the sharp drop in the birthrate around the globe, something he called a path of willed self-extinction. Things have only gotten worse since then. In 1960, the American birthrate was 3.65 per couple; by 2000, it was 2.06; and by 2020, it was 1.64. A small spike during COVID was only a brief respite; the birth rate continues downwards. (READ MORE from Shmuel Klatzkin: The American People Know the Real Hamas) A recent article in the Free Press suggests an underlying cause. In her article this week, Rikki Schlott makes the case that as men trend increasingly rightwards and women increasingly towards the left, establishing a relationship between them becomes increasingly difficult and rare. Why should that be so? It wasn’t terribly uncommon in America fifty years ago for husband and wife to have political differences. By and large, the structures of our communal life — our schools, our houses of worship, our service clubs, and our bowling league, and our bridge clubs embraced people of both parties and a range of political opinions. There was a broad consensus that was the atmosphere of the country. We thrived within a large, civil consensus, and believed that it was capable of working through life’s challenges successfully together. Yes, it had its limits. But we accepted the need for rebellion, even as we tried to temper its rough edges. We knew we needed its enlivening energy and we made places for it. We had stable forms capable of constructively channeling an abundance of life energy. We believed we could grow and thrive, changing but always coherent. The greatest success was in being a religious land without religious coercion. Although religions make special claims on people, setting boundaries on behavior, on beliefs, and even on acceptable partners for marriage, the experience of the millennia embodied in our religions tempers the fanaticism that into which faith claims have been known to lapse. American religious freedom meant that our religious communities had to renounce the favorite ploy of the fanatic — using the power of the state to force doctrinal conformity. Separating religion and state is not something absolute. We are both religious and political beings, for religion means simply our addressing of the deepest issues of life, the place from which first principles and axioms spring, and politics is how we negotiate together the practical life of the polis, our lives together. Political freedom requires our own inner commitment, that which religion teaches and reinforces — that we must govern ourselves if we wish to be free of needing a tyrant to enforce order. The religious wars of Europe, and in particular, the bloody struggles over religion during the English Civil War, were a caution to the American Founders. The political differences of Charles I and the Parliament did not rise to out-and-out war until the struggle was successfully framed as religious. And so it was fought — a war between the supporters of the episcopate on the King’s side, and an alliance of Scottish Presbyterians and English Puritans on the other. The man who won the war, Oliver Cromwell, constantly framed the political and even military issues in fiery religious language. Here he writes in a letter about his triumph at the battle of Marston Moor: Truly England and the Church of God hath had a great favour from the Lord, in this great Victory given unto us, such as the like never was since this War began. It had all the evidences of an absolute Victory obtained by the Lord’s blessing upon the Godly Party principally. We never charged but we routed the enemy. The Left Wing, which I commanded, being our own horse, saving a few Scots in our rear, beat all the Prince’s horse. God made them as stubble to our swords. His “Godly Party” won the war and established what amounted to a military dictatorship for more than a decade. Renouncing tyranny, the American Founders rejected the idea that our own politics should settle whose is the Godly Party. Rather, we should place religion beyond the reach of politics, so that all would give the state their assent as citizens and their practical duty, to paraphrase part of Washington’s reassuring reply to the Jewish community of Newport in 1790. (READ MORE: The Story of Oct. 7 Is the Same as the Story of Dec. 7) But in America in the early 21 st century, politics has again entwined itself in religion. Cultural Marxism holds sway over a large swath of America, and over one of its great political parties. Like all Marxism, it is a religion. Its faith is that its politics embody the ultimate truth, and whereas all the traditional religions are merely exploitative power-grabbers, hiding their motives and manipulating their followers with untrue and outdated narratives. They believe that tolerance and freedom of religion and of expression are negative, as there is no need to debate the truth which is theirs entirely. Their revolutionary politics believes our First Amendment freedoms are harmful and should be eliminated. Just as traditional religions in their heydays usually insisted and always preferred that their followers marry only within their community, the new religion of the cultural Marxists insists as well on no out-marrying. How could there be any true relationship of any sort between the awakened people of the light and the oppressors, i.e., everyone who is not similarly awakened? And if that is true of relationships in general, how much the more so of intimate relationships. The effect of that religious requirement of the cultural Marxism that has a grip on the young’s education fans out widely. The NY Post reports of a recent poll by a Bay Area research firm, Change, that showed “that 55% of women found it a turnoff for a partner to listen to ‘The Joe Rogan Experience’ while 53% said it was offputting for a love interest to refuse to see Greta Gerwig’s summer blockbuster ‘Barbie.’” As political differences increase between the sexes, and as politics tries to become religion, we can see the power of this driver increasing in our birthrate stats. As a religion, Marxism in general is not family friendly. In the largest Communist country, the South China Post reports that “China posts record-low birth rate despite government push for babies.” In America, the higher the level of education and power, the lower the birth rate. Only natural when one feels part of an elite with more wisdom than the traditional institutions and inherited culture of the poor idiots over whom the elite have the right to rule with no accountability and less limitation. (READ MORE: Complicit Media Wants Israel to Spare the Children ) In the section of the Torah read this week in Jewish synagogues around the world, God tells Moses that the people should “make Me a Sanctuary and I will dwell in them.” The text long ago drew attention — shouldn’t it have said “I will dwell in it,” in that Sanctuary they are to build. But no. The Sanctuary and all outer structures exist for the purpose of Godliness within each one of us. That enables us to be right with each other. That enables us to build relationships, which enable us to build families, build societies, and build nations and a community of nations. Without it, we don’t even get to square one. With no relation to that which transcends us, we die with no one to follow us and carry on the shared vision. We perish in our isolation, in our chosen extinction on the altar of our own woke perfection. The transforming of politics into religious war is self-immolation. Opposing this suicidal trend is the deepest reason for my own political conservatism. We must conserve the place of religion in society and we must refuse to let politics swallow it up. We dedicate our lives to the Oneness that makes possible the bridging of human differences in loving relationships and gladly bring new life into the world."
"1","WASHINGTON — How bad is the situation at the Southwest border? I attended a hearing Thursday of the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs on the consequences of the current “catch and release” policies to observe how members of both parties address an issue that troubles American voters. The situation at the border is so downright scary, Jessica Vaughan of the pro-enforcement Center for Immigration Studies testified, that Mexican cartels are now making more money from human trafficking than drug trafficking. From when President Joe Biden took office until Sept. 30, 2023, at least 3.3 million illegal migrants — or 99.7 percent — have been released into the country, according to a House Judiciary Committee study. A mere 10,522 were removed. (READ MORE from Debra J. Saunders: Putin Wants It All. NATO Stands in His Way) Subcommittee Chairman Glenn Grothman, R-Wisc., observed that with Biden in the Oval Office, violations of immigration laws “will seldom be met with consequences. Certainly not, in most cases, detention and removal.” Democrats don’t have a good argument for the record number of illegal migrants who have entered and remained in America under Biden. So they resorted to ridicule. Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland berated Senate Republicans for failing to pass a bipartisan compromise measure because they couldn’t stand up to pressure from former President Donald Trump. Yes, he had a point. But then Raskin, who so many times has called for civility in politics, flashed a grin that showcased his utter disdain as one GOP member spoke about the problem. Apparently it is gauche to worry about the millions of unauthorized people entering the country. Democrat Rep. Robert Garcia of California mocked the GOP approach by prompting an aide to display a graphic of some of Trump’s more outlandish spit-balling on the situation — alligator moats with electrified fences, and shooting migrants in the legs. (READ MORE: After Border Security Fails, Biden Faults Trump ) According to a 2019 New York Times story, Trump entertained those ideas. “I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough,” Trump replied on Twitter. “The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!” For her part, Vaughan recommended Washington spend more money “removing criminal aliens.” Grothman said he wants to learn more about how much taxpayers must pay for unauthorized migrants who have access to welfare benefits, housing, and Medicaid. In the back of the room sat Kurt Leptich and his wife, Sheila, of the California border town Brawley. They were visiting family and read about the hearing, and figured they’d stop by. Leptich told me he’s seen local hotels, even a country club, turned into housing for migrants in recent years. Leptich doesn’t think it’s fair that outsiders can break American laws and be rewarded with a “motel room with a flat-screen TV and a telephone.” The newcomers did not match Leptich’s expectations. “If they’re escaping persecution, I would think they would arrive destitute,” Leptich told me. He did not expect to see people who looked well-fed and carried working cellphones. I ask: Were things different under former President Donald Trump than they are under Biden? Yes, Leptich responded. “I wish we had some of Trump’s policies with a person that could be normal.” Contact Review-Journal Washington columnist Debra J. Saunders at dsaunders@reviewjournal.com .

"1","T he Coca-Cola Company , the quintessential American multinational that is the world’s largest non-alcoholic beverages enterprise, is in the process of addressing the most consequential force majeure political risk it faces for the remainder of this century: China—U.S. geostrategic tension that very likely will lead to economic warfare and possibly military confrontation. Coca-Cola was blindsided by the U.S. government’s overwhelming response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: comprehensive economic warfare against Russia and extensive military support for Ukraine. The Company was forced to completely exit from the Russian market and recognize a loss of $96 million , which fortunately was not significant. If the adage, “once bitten, twice shy” is a truism, then it is reasonable to assume that Coca-Cola has a strategy to immunize itself against China political risk. Surprisingly, investment analysts have not exhibited any curiosity as to what such a strategy might be and, not surprisingly, the company has refrained from discussing it. Consequently, one must connect the dots of publicly available information to decode Coca-Cola’s strategy to address its China challenge. The picture that emerges is quite reassuring. The China Challenge in Context Simply put, China matters. Although Russia may be characterized as a 1 percent problem, China is a 10 percent plus problem. After all, according to the World Bank , China is the world’s largest economy with a 2022 GDP (in terms of purchasing power parity or PPP) of $30 trillion, which completely dwarf’s Russia’s GDP of $5 trillion and is ahead of America’s GDP of $25 trillion. From the perspective of Coca-Cola, addressing its China political risk challenge has three facets: (1) purchase of investments of Chinese-controlled entities in U.S. bottlers of Coca-Cola, (2) sale of the Company’s investments in Coca-Cola bottlers in China and surrounding countries within China’s sphere of influence, and (3) developing alternatives to Coca-Cola sales of concentrates to bottlers in China and to Chinese-controlled bottlers outside China. Bottom line: Coca-Cola has yet to address the first facet but may be preparing to make a move, while it has made considerable progress on the other two fronts. So, let’s connect the dots. Acquisition of Chinese Investments in US Bottlers of Coca-Cola The Swire Group , which has extensive business interests and deep roots in China since the 1860s, is among the top five Coca- Cola bottlers world-wide. Swire Coca-Cola , wholly owned by the Swire Group, is a key Coca-Cola bottler in the western United States, with a franchise area covering 13 states. The Swire Group is also a major Coca-Cola bottler in Greater China, including 11 provinces, plus Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. From a China political risk perspective, the Swire Group as a practical matter is a Chinese entity. Ultimately, the only way Coca-Cola can eliminate Chinese political risk within its U.S. bottling system is to acquire the Swire Group’s U.S. bottling franchises and, at an appropriate time, refranchise them to a suitable non-Chinese partner. In September 2023, in an intragroup restructuring involving the cash sale of Swire Coca-Cola’s U.S. operations by Swire Pacific (Hong Kong) to its controlling shareholder, John Swire & Sons Ltd (UK), the U.S. bottling business was valued at about $4 billion . There is now a clear path, including a valuation benchmark, for a possible Coca-Cola transaction to acquire the U.S. bottling operations of the Swire Group that helps address a key facet of the company’s China political risk challenge. The critical importance of such a potential transaction is manifest, so the company is likely to make a decisive move sometime in 2024. Coca-Cola Divestments in China, Cambodia, and Vietnam In 2022, Coca-Cola divested its minority interest in the Coca-Cola bottling operations in China to the majority owner, COFCO (a Chinese state-owned enterprise), and sold its wholly owned Coca-Cola bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia for an aggregate amount of about $1.3 billion cash to Swire Pacific (HK) , part of the Swire Group. As a consequence, Coca-Cola has successfully eliminated its exposure as a shareholder in the manufacturing, bottling, and distribution operations of its local franchisees in China and the two major countries within China’s sphere of influence. Coca-Cola can now focus on selling its concentrates to local franchisees in these countries, and reducing its China political risk exposure by diversifying away from China and expanding in other markets such as India. India: Coca-Cola’s Future Crown Jewel? If mushrooming political risk is eclipsing the future growth potential of the Greater China market for Coca- Cola, what is the alternative? India is the obvious answer. The U.S. and India (which has an unresolved border dispute with China that has been festering for 65 years) have converging vital geostrategic interests in seeking to counterbalance China , so from a political risk perspective, ultimately India is a lower risk than China. Per the World Bank, India has the world’s third largest economy, with a 2022 GDP (PPP basis) of $12 trillion , and the largest population of 1.42 billion . The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is bullish on India and expects India’s economy to grow at about 6.3 percent annually in 2023 and 2024 . (READ MORE from Samir Tata: Cold War With China Requires Mercantilism 2.0 ) The U.S. government projects that India’s economy will be larger than that of the U.S. within a generation — by 2043. In terms of annual per capita consumption of nonalcoholic beverages (as measured by the number of 8-ounce servings) India has one of the lowest at 95 compared to China at 337 and the U.S. at 1,447 — clearly there is huge upside growth potential for Coca-Cola. There is every indication that the company is determined to seize the opportunity to make India its crown jewel. If the India pivot succeeds, and the next five years will be crucial in this regard, Coca-Cola will have knocked out its threat of China political risk.

"2","The United States needs more immigrants. But at the moment, it does not especially want them. The country’s fertility rate has fallen far below the replacement level. Absent immigration, our nation will grow older and smaller simultaneously. In that scenario, a shrinking population of prime-age workers would need to support a ballooning population of retirees. Growth would slow , productivity would fall, and deficits would swell. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently illuminated these realities. In an update to its 10-year economic forecast released February 7, the CBO reported that America’s gross domestic product would be $7 trillion higher — and the federal deficit $1 trillion lower — than it had previously anticipated. This pleasant surprise came courtesy of the past year’s surge in immigration: Due to that uptick in new arrivals, the US is now on track to have 5.2 million more workers by 2033 than previously projected. That will increase the amount of goods and services the economy can produce and improve the nation’s ratio of laborers to retirees. Even as the case for large-scale immigration has become stronger, however, political appetite for it has grown weaker. In Gallup’s polling , the share of Americans who want immigration levels “decreased” rose from 28 percent in 2020 to 41 percent in 2023. By contrast, only 26 percent of 2023 respondents wanted to increase immigration. This restrictionist mood is apparent in polls focusing on the 2024 presidential race. In a recent Bloomberg News/Morning Consult survey of swing states, voters said they trusted Donald Trump over Joe Biden on immigration by a 22-point margin, 52 to 30 percent. And this was, if anything, an unusually positive result for the president: An NBC News poll released this month found voters favoring Trump over Biden on immigration by 35 points. This fundamental tension — between a growing economic need for immigrants and burgeoning political backlash against mass immigration — is common to virtually all wealthy countries. The world’s 15 largest economies all have below-replacement fertility rates and aging populations. Yet a wide variety of those countries have recently imposed new immigration restrictions, and right-wing nationalist parties have gained ground in elections. Overcoming this nativist backlash is a political imperative. We cannot ensure America’s future prosperity — or provide a home to the many millions who will be displaced by climate change — without fostering more pro-immigrant politics. Precisely how liberals can go about doing this is hard to say. Much of today’s backlash is rooted in the peculiar challenges of asylum policy. In 2022, 2.9 million people applied for asylum, the most since at least 2000, according to the United Nations. In 2023, another 1.7 million submitted applications. A large surge in asylum claims presents difficulties that an ordinary expansion of immigration does not. Governments can control the number of documented immigrants they admit annually and give preferential treatment to those who meet pressing national needs. Documented immigrants also have the right to work and impose no special burden on a nation’s judicial system or fiscal resources. They don’t need their legal status adjudicated in court and tend to have a more positive impact on the government’s finances than native-born Americans. By contrast, states can control neither the number of people who claim asylum at their borders nor the skills or age profile of that population. Asylum seekers are also typically denied work permits while they await the final adjudication of their cases, which can take years. This takes a toll on the resources of the municipalities where they live. Chicago and New York City have struggled to maintain social services for their permanent residents amid large inflows of asylum seekers, with NYC spending $1.4 billion on caring for migrants, according to the mayor’s office. Predictably, the politics of immigration in the Empire State have turned rightward in response. In a perfect world, liberals could mitigate all these challenges by dramatically expanding opportunities for immigration and investing in more robust administrative systems for screening, resettling, and integrating asylum seekers. In our actual world, Democrats can’t even get Republicans to support their own party’s preferred reforms to the asylum process , thanks in part to Trump’s demagogy. But there is one area where many Democrats are making the politics of immigration more toxic without any help from Trump’s GOP: By suppressing housing construction through restrictive zoning laws, deep-blue municipalities are engineering a situation in which immigrants genuinely threaten the economic interests of native-born residents. If liberals want their country to be more welcoming of immigrants, they need to make their cities’ housing stock more accommodating of newcomers. The economic case against immigration is weak (unless you make it illegal to build apartments) In recent years, commentators on both the left and right have called the economic benefits of immigration into question. They’ve noted that Americans benefit from tight labor markets, in which firms must bid against each other for a scarce pool of workers. Large inflows of immigrant laborers undermine the bargaining power of native-born workers, the theory goes, thereby depressing wages and increasing unemployment. One may be able to find evidence of this phenomenon in discrete industries, but there’s little basis for believing that it holds at the level of the economy writ large. The tightness of labor markets is not determined by the supply of labor alone. If that were true, then America’s median wage would have steadily declined — and its employment rate steadily risen — as its population increased over the 20th century. But the baby boomers’ mass entrance into the labor force did not, in fact, trigger a second Great Depression in the 1960s. This is because the labor market is also affected by the demand for workers’ labor. Immigrants may expand the size of the workforce, but they also increase demand for goods and services. Ultimately, fiscal and monetary policy shape the balance between labor demand and supply far more than immigration admissions do. If you understimulate the economy, you can have high unemployment amid a mass exodus of immigrant workers (as occurred during the Great Depression ). If you ramp up government spending, on the other hand, you can have low unemployment amid a large increase in immigration (as we’ve seen during the post-Covid boom ). For these reasons, a wide variety of studies and meta-analyses have found that immigrants do not generally reduce wages or job opportunities for native-born workers. But rents and home prices are a different story. In principle, there is no reason why population growth must push up the cost of shelter. Immigrants need homes — but they are also disproportionately likely to work in construction and, thus, increase the economy’s home-building capacity. The problem arises when governments effectively prohibit the supply of housing from rising in line with demand. Between 2012 and 2022, Americans formed 15.6 million new households but built only 11.9 million new housing units. As a result, even before the post-lockdown surge in migration, there were more aspiring households than homes in America’s thriving metro areas. This was largely a consequence of zoning restrictions. Municipal governments have collectively made it illegal to erect an apartment building on about 75 percent of our country’s residential land. In large swaths of the country, there are households eager to rent or buy a modest apartment, and developers eager to provide them, but zoning restrictions have blocked such transactions from taking place. This creates a housing shortage. You can house 32 families much more quickly and cheaply by building a single apartment building than by erecting 32 separate houses. To require all of your community’s housing units to be single-family homes isn’t all that different from prohibiting the manufacture of all non-luxury cars. In both cases, you end up with artificial scarcity and unaffordability. If private builders were allowed to respond to rising demand — while the government ensured the provision of housing to those unable to pay market rents — we could have large increases in immigration without any uptick in housing insecurity. In our current reality, the rise in asylum seekers has coincided with a record spike in homelessness and persistently high housing costs. It is hard enough to sustain popular support for large-scale immigration when there aren’t major economic downsides to that policy. Add legitimate concerns about housing costs to perennial anxieties over cultural change, and it becomes difficult for even the most pro- immigration societies to avoid a nativist backlash. Or at least, this is what recent events in Canada suggest. Why Canada is getting colder on immigration Canada has long been considered an exceptionally pro-immigrant country . Yet it has struggled to sustain popular support for liberal immigration policies amid its deepening housing shortage. Canada’s experience therefore serves as a cautionary tale for American progressives: If we allow municipalities to suppress housing construction, then ridding our nation’s mainstream politics of Trumpian xenophobia and electing a vigorously pro-immigrant administration will not be enough to avert popular demands for restricting immigration. Until recently, Canada’s immigration politics were the envy of US cosmopolitans. In 2016, while many other nations were trying to repel Syrian refugees, the Canadian government couldn’t find enough displaced families to meet the public’s demand for sponsoring them. Since 2019, the country has welcomed more refugees than any other nation, and done so with minimal public outcry. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sought to capitalize on his country’s multicultural openness by putting immigration expansion at the center of his vision of economic growth. Canada welcomed 471,550 new permanent residents in 2023, up from 300,000 in 2015. And that figure does not include foreign students, temporary workers, and refugees, who together constitute an even larger group of new arrivals. In 2025 and 2026, the government aims to admit 500,000 new permanent residents each year. But in recent months, the political sustainability of Trudeau’s plan has come into question, in no small part because immigration’s impact on housing costs has come under scrutiny. Rents have soared across Canada in recent years. From 1990 to 2022, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the country increased at an average annual rate of 2.8 percent. In 2023, it rose by 8 percent. The government estimates that it will need to add 3.5 million extra housing units by 2030 to make shelter affordable. But a recent report from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce suggests that this underestimates the housing shortage by 1.5 million units, a shortfall driven by an undercount of nonpermanent immigrants, who have been entering the country in massive numbers. Trudeau has sought to promote housing construction in various ways. But his administration’s efforts have yet to offset the impact of years of highly restrictive zoning in many of Canada’s largest population centers. As Canadians bid against each other for an inadequate supply of housing units, they’ve soured on immigration. In a 2022 poll from the Environics Institute for Survey Research , Canadians disagreed with the statement that there was too much immigration in their country by a margin of 42 points. One year later, that margin had shrunk to 7 points, the largest single-year shift in the survey’s history. Among Canadians who said immigration levels were too high, the most commonly cited reason by far was that immigrants drive up housing prices. In response to these changing political winds, the Trudeau government has sought to restrict admissions of international students while imploring universities to provide dedicated housing for their enrollees. But this minor concession to the nation’s restrictionist mood appears insufficient. The prime minister’s approval rating has sunk in recent months, with 64 percent of Canadians now disapproving of his performance. Meanwhile, Canada’s Conservative Party has ridden the housing and immigration issues to a strong advantage over Trudeau’s Liberals in the polls. Abundance is possible, but scarcity seems popular There are many parallels between the politics of immigration reform and those of housing policy . In both cases, countries have the power to swiftly increase their collective prosperity by tolerating some short-term disruptions. When cities let developers build more housing, they not only reduce rent inflation but also increase their tax bases, which makes it easier to fund robust social services. When rich nations let prime-age immigrants settle within their borders, they increase their productive capacity, which makes it more affordable to support retirees. And yet, in both of these policy areas, we routinely opt to make ourselves poorer for the sake of avoiding change. America does not need to choose between expanding immigration and reducing housing costs. But there is a risk that we’ll choose to do neither. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","On the Money is a monthly advice column. If you want advice on spending, saving, or investing — or any of the complicated emotions that may come up as you prepare to make big financial decisions — you can submit your question on this form . Here, we answer two questions asked by Vox readers, which have been edited and condensed. I was recently laid off from a well-paying job. I have plenty of savings and live frugally, so I don’t need to find a replacement job right away — although I am looking! Here’s my question: Since I have very little income coming in (just capital gains and dividends from my investment portfolio), I may be eligible for governmental aid programs such as health care subsidies and utility bill assistance. I haven’t applied to anything because I feel like I’m not what people have in mind when they think of social programs . That said, these programs would give me a safety net and help me stretch my assets as I look for new employment. Is it ethical for a high-wealth, low-income household to apply for this kind of assistance? I am very familiar with this question, believe me. I’ve asked it myself, every time I’ve been in a position to take advantage of a social program — and every time, the answer has been provided for me. Affordable Care Act health care subsidies , for example, are automatic. I used to skip the part of the application where they asked whether I wanted to check my eligibility for a subsidy, because I was making more than the median household income and I didn’t feel like I deserved one. However, the federal government isn’t interested in how you feel about your subsidy status. They’ve already calculated how much money you’re entitled to receive, and any portion of your subsidy that isn’t deducted from your premium turns into a tax credit when you file your tax return — and whether you’re working with a CPA or using one of those online tax prep services, the person and/or robot in charge of preparing your taxes will make sure you claim that premium tax credit ! Now I just check the box and get my subsidy in advance. No ethical considerations required. I’ve also been on SNAP, back when it was still called food stamps. This was when I was a grad student with very little income, and you had better believe that I agonized over the application. I was in graduate school , studying theater , which was pretty much the top of the privilege pile. Wasn’t I obligated to spend down my savings before applying? Well, that question is actually fundamental to the SNAP application process. They’ll turn down anybody with more than a certain amount of income or assets — and even though I was proud of my hard-earned savings and my ability to stretch a dollar, I discovered that having $1,000 in the bank and $200 in monthly income still qualified me for federal assistance. So I took it. I also checked in regularly with the program, to ensure that my income and assets were still within the eligibility guidelines. (This can be a problem for some households, especially when a slightly better-paying job kicks them out of much-needed benefits, and it’s also a problem when SNAP eligibility requirements change .) Once I was no longer eligible, I took a few years to shore up my own savings and establish my career — and then I began looking for ways to give back. While much of my charitable work has involved in-person volunteering, I’ve also made a few significant financial gifts. I donated my $1,200 Covid stimulus check , for example, because I knew I was in the part of the privilege pile that would allow me to maintain my income throughout the pandemic. This is a long way of explaining that I’ve asked myself many similar questions — and that many of your concerns will solve themselves once you look into application requirements. If you still feel ethically conflicted about accepting assistance, you can always put more time and energy into getting a new job. You could also put some of that time and energy toward volunteering, or — if you really wanted to give back — toward supporting politicians and candidates who want to maintain and/or expand these essential social programs. I’ve been poor all my life, and I’ve recently come into a windfall. I’ve paid off all my bills except the mortgage. What’s the best thing to do with the remaining $100K so I don’t just waste it? Put the equivalent of three months’ living expenses into your checking account. That’s your day-to-day spending money. At the beginning of each month, make sure that you still have roughly the same amount of money in there. (If the amount keeps getting smaller, you’re spending more than you’re earning .) Put another three months’ living expenses into a savings account. That’s the money you can pull from for gifts, vacations, splurges, etc. Try to make it last all year. If you receive any bonuses or raises, use the extra money to replenish the savings account. Put the equivalent of six months’ living expenses in a high-yield savings account. That’s your emergency fund. It’ll be there if you have a major medical expense or unexpected job loss. Put the rest of the money into CDs. They’re the highest guaranteed-interest-rate vehicles you can find right now, and they’ll keep your money locked away so you can’t spend it. Ladder your CDs so that one of them comes due next year, one of them comes due two years from now, and so on. Every time a CD matures, replenish your splurge account and then put the rest of the cash right back into another CD. If a large, non-emergency expense presents itself — a new car, for example, or a wedding — you can use CD money for that as well. You won’t be wealthy, but you can rest assured that you aren’t wasting your windfall. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","To be a True Detective fan is to wrestle with uncomfortable contradictions. The first season is both a masterpiece of cosmic horror noir and a piece of art that feels like it was created not just by, but for men. It was a gritty treatise against toxic masculinity that still dehumanized women and ultimately reified the very thing it attempted to deconstruct. For all its critical acclaim and influence on prestige drama in the years that followed, True Detective also generated a deeply toxic fanbase. These fans were men who missed the point but who saw themselves as a vital part of the show’s metatextuality, the real “true detectives” all along. Ever since, that first season has primarily been remembered, not for its incredible acting, its brilliant aesthetic touches, that legendary six-minute tracking shot , nor even the now-ubiquitous line, “Time is a flat circle,” but for the misogyny. Its two subsequent seasons have mostly been forgotten altogether. All of these uneasy truths loom large over season four, True Detective: Night Country , 10 years after its progenitor. Every succeeding season of this anthology series has occupied a lose-lose position simply by not being season one. But season four, by virtue of being centered around two women — a local chief of police (Jodie Foster) and a state trooper (Kali Reis) trying to solve a mysterious set of murders in the unforgiving Alaskan north — has simultaneously raised the stakes for the series and revived all of True Detective’s messy paradoxes. Night Country’s new showrunner and writer/director Issa López needed to accomplish two risky, ambitious goals: The season had to justify itself as a creative follow-up to a work that’s very difficult to follow up, and rectify the notorious sexism of season one in a way that would hopefully allow the series to forge a new path. Its sixth episode, which aired Sunday on HBO , had to reconcile both goals in a satisfying finale. To many among True Detective’s original fanbase, outrage at the second goal has precluded an objective view of how well it’s succeeding at the first. By the same token, many longtime fans are so eager to see the second project succeed that they’re quick to dismiss all critiques of season four’s creative aims as pure misogyny. These seem like unbridgeable positions. But there’s unfortunately a third view: that Night Country’s creative flaws ultimately torpedo its efforts at feminist reclamation, shifting the season finale away from a compelling cosmic mystery and toward a hamfisted Me Too revenge plot that leaves a comic number of plot points unresolved and arguably weakens the whole series. (Note: Spoilers for Sunday’s season four finale abound.) Season Four’s clunky writing and direction never got what made True Detective work To be fair to López, this isn’t the first season of True Detective to miss the mark by a mile. Season two, a hasty, shoddy 2015 follow-up from series creator and season one writer Nic Pizzolatto, featured all the worst parts of season one on speed — the tortured masculinity, the presentation of women as little more than sexy window-dressing, and a poor imitation of all of Matthew McConaughey’s famous existential monologues as Rust Cohle shoehorned into vapid machismo nonsense from Colin Farrell’s dysfunctional detective. Perhaps to shift himself and HBO away from misplaced allegations of plagiarism , Pizzolatto cut out most of season one’s mesmerizing Weird fiction elements: murky occult figures, arcane Lovecraftian rituals, and worship of the “Yellow King.” If season two had too little of the supernatural, 2019’s third season was a true return to form, with Pizzolatto returning to the deep South and to a cold case tinged with occult horror, floating on a sense of nonlinear time, and backed by a soul-filled T Bone Burnett soundtrack. But by then, the world was a much different place, and True Detective had to compete with a field of its own descendants — shows as disparate as 2017’s Mindhunter and 2018’s The Terror , each successful at cordoning off a sliver of True Detective’s genius for themselves. Still, anchored by Mahershala Ali’s pitch-perfect turn as an aging detective who spends decades trying to solve a cold case, season three really clarified the True Detective formula: A labyrinthine mystery driven by deep characterization, replete with hints of a dark otherworldly version of reality, filmed with an attention to aesthetics, and written with a certain literary flourish. Perhaps most of all, True Detective has to have a philosophy — a commitment to engaging with those eldritch horrors, if only to nod to them and be on your way. On paper, Night Country ticks a lot of those boxes. Inspired by the recently solved Dyatlov Pass incident ( an avalanche did it ), the season follows a quest to solve the gruesome deaths of a team of scientists. The group was found naked, frozen, and apparently terrified to death in the tundra near the small town of Ennis, Alaska. Populated mainly by Iñupiat residents whose water has turned black due to pollution from an evil mining plant, Ennis has plunged into its annual winter stretch of sunless polar night , and tensions are high as the local police begin their investigation. Sheriff Danvers (Foster) and Trooper Navarro (Reis) work to solve the murders while navigating their own rocky history. The brutal, still- unsolved murder of an Iñupiaq activist has unexpected connections to the current crime; the women quickly realize they have to bury their differences and work together to solve all the murders at once. Jodie Foster and Kali Reis explore the terror of the Arctic. Michele K. Short/HBO Like season one, the finale brings us to a literal labyrinth, this time deep in the ice caves beneath Ennis. López has exchanged the Yellow King for an unnamed divine feminine spirit, perhaps Sedna or Mother Nature. (There’s also a tongue-in- cheek reference to the “Blue King” crab company throughout.) The locals all seem to be aware of “her,” and as our story progresses it becomes clear that some of them view the spirit of the murdered activist as synonymous with this ancient entity. In the final episode, we finally meet her — or at least we come as close to “her” as we can get. But the similarities to that first season are all surface. López didn’t originally plan to create Night Country as a part of the True Detective universe, and her efforts to incorporate callbacks to previous True Detective seasons make that painfully clear. Throughout season four, references to season one recur, but they usually lack context and aren’t justified by anything happening around them. We learn a season four character had a relationship with Rust Cohle’s father; but so what? We learn our evil mining corporation has ties to evil corporate overlords from previous seasons ... and? There are spirals everywhere, but we gain no enhanced understanding of what this familiar motif means. López picks up on the well-known line, “You’re asking the wrong question.” She has characters repeat variants of this statement over and over again throughout season four until it becomes preposterous, an annoying substitute for meaningful writing. Each reference, from “flat circle” to Funyuns, is purely fan service, a distracting blip on the map that contributes nothing to our understanding of the True Detective universe. The same goes for Night Country’s over-the-top horror elements, which range from pointless jump scares to spectral phenomena that appear for no reason. Where season two was completely devoid of the supernatural, Night Country is so full of ghosts that they lose all significance. Other aesthetic choices are so baffling as to be unintentionally hilarious. Night Country utilizes a bizarrely off-kilter soundtrack of somber minor-key covers of famous pop songs that are absolutely incongruous with the mood of the show, from Eagle-Eye Cherry’s 1997 bop “Save Tonight” to eerie Christmas music. In the finale, we get a dark emo needle drop of “Twist and Shout,” and the gravely intoned “Shake it up, baby” lands with such unbelievable dissonance that I burst into laughter. Night Country’s finale goes belly-up in the most frustrating way possible To be clear, both Foster and Reis are fantastic. Foster’s Sheriff Danvers keeps up a gruff loner hostility, pushing away her family, her partner, and her community, even as she works tirelessly to protect them all. When her exterior finally cracks open, it’s to reveal an unforgettable tapestry of grief and resilience. By contrast, Reis’s Navarro bleeds raw vulnerability throughout, running hot and then hotter as she gets closer to the truth in her long quest to find a killer, and perhaps an even more ancient quest to pursue the unknown spirit of the north. As individual characters, they fully fit into the tradition of True Detective’s spiritually clashing sleuths who galvanize each other through a charged mix of loathing and shared desperation. Yet Danvers’ cynicism and Navarro’s spirituality never satisfyingly cohere — a fundamental flaw that Night Country doesn’t fully overcome. For all that Reis is excellent, when she and Foster are onscreen together she seems stifled, limited to churlishness and sarcasm. In episode six, Foster delivers an acting master class as her character finally reveals a little of her personal heartbreak, only to be met with a disconnected non-response from Navarro. It’s as if López didn’t know how to follow her own mic drop, so didn’t bother trying. It’s a hesitance that encapsulates a season full of baffling choices and inconsistent characterizations. Perhaps the most baffling choice of all comes in the finale, when we finally learn that the murders of the scientists were facilitated by the women of Ennis, as payback for the murder of the activist — who, it turns out, the scientists themselves murdered and covered up, years ago. The show fully glosses over the improbable way the women learn about this cover-up to barrel toward what’s meant to be a righteous showstopper: They break into the science lab, armed to the teeth, and enact their vengeance, forcing the scientists to undress and fend for themselves in the brutal Arctic night. This climax comes off as a ludicrous, unearned payoff, with undeveloped cardboard villagers standing in as mouthpieces for larger political stances, as they have throughout the season for environmental activism and post- Roe medical care . Here, though, it’s as if López was determined to reverse- engineer a feminist morality play, even if it meant superseding all attempts at coherent storytelling. To add insult to injury, the biggest unresolved “mystery” of the show — the one we’re left to assume was the work of the mysterious Arctic god — involves a human tongue being dropped on the floor. That’s right. We’re meant to believe “she” made her presence known by ... spectrally drop-kicking a tongue under a lab table. (The season’s second- biggest mystery, Navarro’s fate at the end, gets left deliberately ambiguous in the finale’s closing shot. Did she walk into the tundra for good, following the siren song of the ice goddess a la Frozen 2 , or did she come back alive? We can’t be certain, but the idea that she’s now a ghost herself would feel more satisfying if Navarro’s struggle and escalating mental breakdown had felt less like a casual aside every now and then.) This absurd plot resolution comes well after Pizzolatto himself reportedly shaded this season, calling the writing “stupid,” much to the delight of fanboys who couldn’t wait to bash the show purely on the basis of its female representation. Who do we root for? Of course we want to root for Night Country under these conditions, and the show has won a high score of “ universal acclaim ” on Metacritic. And yet I’ve got a dirty tongue backed by the world’s worst Lana Del Rey album that begs to differ. What’s most frustrating about all of this is that this mess needn’t have happened. There are plenty of examples of better written, better directed female crime-solving duos in communities of sisters doing it for themselves. Last year’s criminally underrated Australian dramedy Deadloch , for example, mined this formula for comedy gold and plenty of suspense alongside well- earned feminist proselytizing. But it did so by relying on whip-smart writing, a story that bears out the moral, and phenomenal acting and chemistry between its two leads — arguably the truest detectives of all in this farce. The downgrade from Pizzolatto’s season one craft to the clunky sophomoric writing of season four was probably avoidable. If Night Country had just been allowed to be its own thing, without any pressure to either live up to season one or abide by its Weird parameters, it probably would have been a much better show. We can’t fault HBO for wanting to revive one of its best franchises. But Night Country may ultimately go down as a reminder that sometimes it’s best to let sleeping eldritch creations lie.

"1","O h, to be a conservative now that election season is nigh. For the record, I am a conservative and will likely spend the months leading up to Election Day comparing and contrasting the efficacy of various over-the-counter antacids. Despite the fact that the GOP nomination is essentially a foregone conclusion, it is no secret that within the conservative movement, the debate of Trump vs Non-Trump has created its fair share of internecine animus. Anyone who may have even a slight reservation about Trump risks being labeled a closet progressive and a RINO. Conversely, a conservative who saw some benefits of Trump’s term may find themselves characterized as a knuckle-dragging, red- hatted MAGA Neanderthal who clubs women over the head and feasts nightly on raw wooly-rhinoceros in his cave. And that’s just from the conservatives. As a conservative who has been ambivalent about Trump, is a former evangelical, and who earned a master’s degree as part of a now-defunct plan to become a pastor, I was interested in the film God & Country, produced by Rob Reiner and set for release this month. I have a continued interest in religion and matters of faith and was excited to get permission to screen the movie in advance. An interview with the director did not come together by the time I hit my deadline. I planned to approach the film with an open mind and to see what I could glean from it. I thought to myself, “Who knows? The filmmakers may have some points to make.” God & Country is somewhat of a study in contrasts. The viewer is treated to plenty of scenes of the January 6 riot and incendiary snippets from the likes of Marjorie Taylor Greene, Robert Jeffress, John MacArthur, Greg Locke, and Charlie Kirk. Ralph Reed, Rick Wiles, Glenn Beck, and even Allie Beth Stuckey make appearances, as does Jerry Falwell and a number of televangelists whom the world has largely forgotten. There is also a generous helping of supercuts from various church services and gatherings like the Flashpoint Rally, CPAC, Reawaken America, and the January 6 riot. (READ MORE from Lincoln Brown: Distinctly American: Who Are RFK Jr.’s Supporters? ) Interspersed with these vignettes of shock, awe, and shame are comments from various thought leaders, some of whom have or had some ties to the evangelical and conservative movements. These include Russell Moore, Phil Vischer, Skye Jethani, David French, and others. During the scenes depicting the violence and rhetoric associated with Christian Nationalism and, by default, the Right, the music is menacing. But when the various experts speak, the music is somber and even soothing. The critics speak in quiet, thoughtful tones, with kind and sometimes pained expressions. The viewer is offered a choice. They can throw their lots in with the crazy, violent anarchists who are hell-bent on creating a new theocracy, or they can join the calm, erudite intellectuals who want nothing but the best for us all. Aside from a few remarks that not all conservative Christians have joined the movement, the middle ground is left unexplored. At one point, a list of organizations that are moneymakers within the conservative movement is displayed on the screen. Among them are the Heritage Foundation and even Hillsdale College. Whether it is intended or not, the image implies that the organizations may be complicit in the efforts to fuse church and state. While the Heritage Foundation and Hillsdale College are certainly conservative, one can hardly call them hotbeds of revolution. One of the sins held up in the film is the opposition to CRT and the LGBTQ movements. A book-burning scene is even included. Along those lines, the clip of Jon Tigges being taken into custody by police at Loudoun County, VA, school board meeting flashes across the screen. Tigges, like many of the people at those meetings, was concerned about the sexualization of students and the mixed use of bathrooms. Of course, it would not be until later when the news broke that a student calling himself transgender had been accused of sexual assaults in girls’ bathrooms, and the school board was attempting to conceal the issue. With that revelation, those parents’ worst fears were confirmed. The film proposes that while a major cause célèbre of Christian Nationalism is abortion, the movement has its genesis in racism, specifically in the opposition to desegregation. While I am not sufficiently schooled in that era of history to categorically deny any connection, it is noteworthy that the popularity of the Left among people of color is decreasing and that it has lost allure for many such people. It also pointedly ignores the fact that there has been a rise in demand for minority-only spaces coming from the Left. The makers of God & Country do not spare the rod when it comes to abortion. Simone Campbell, an attorney and nun who claims she has a nuanced view of abortion, asserts that the practice is not mentioned in the Bible. The case could be made for that, but the Bible does prohibit the taking of innocent life. In the writings of the Apostolic Fathers, one can find condemnations of abortion and the sexualization of children. The average man or woman in the pews may be able to claim ignorance of those writings. As a nun, Campbell must certainly be aware of both issues. I was talking about that scene with a friend of mine. This friend’s mother did not want her as she was an unplanned pregnancy. This was in the days before Roe v. Wade, and my friend said that her mother certainly would have aborted her if she could. The truth is, my friend’s mother gave her to a relative as soon as she was able to do so. My friend went on to become a dedicated and talented healthcare provider who has donated time and services to impoverished people in other countries. I would like to see Campbell sit down with my friend and tell her that she was nothing more than a “nuanced” choice. (READ MORE: The Allegations Against Tim Ballard Must Not Disrupt the Fight Against Human Trafficking ) Similarly, the point is made that many Conservative Christians will donate time and money to stop abortion but dedicate little of either to assist new mothers. This is patently untrue. There are many Christian organizations devoted to that very cause. But acknowledging their existence and efforts runs contrary to the popular narrative the movie reinforces. Clips of January 6 make up much of the imagery in God & Country . I do not agree with some conservatives that everyone who entered the Capitol that day was merely on a convivial, self-guided tour of the building, which included an unscheduled stop at the Nancy Pelosi Gift Shop. But it is disingenuous to claim that everyone there was on a mission to search and destroy and that an overthrow of the government was in progress. And it is not as if there was no precedent for such a thing. The nation and world watched when, not so long before January 6, progressive protestors took to the streets to loot, burn, and create chaos. And in the ensuing years, there have been incidents of leftist protestors occupying government buildings. While the Hamas terror attack on October 7 likely occurred after filming on God & Country wrapped, one cannot deny the vitriol and the acts of violence aimed at Jews across the nation and the world. And much of it was reminiscent of that of the Third Reich. God & Country strives mightily to point out the suspected sins and navigational errors of the Right while studiously avoiding those of the Left. During the film, Anthea Butler, the author of White Evangelical Racism , muses on what might happen in the unlikely event that the nation should become a dictatorial theocracy. She wonders what would happen to those who do not fit the Christian Nationalist demographic. That is a question that conservatives, even those who want nothing to do with Christian Nationalism, have been asking themselves in terms of the current trajectory of the nation. The media, academia, and at times, even the government itself have indicated that conservatives, and even people without political affiliation who subscribe to traditional viewpoints, will have no place in the future of America. Late in God & Country, Skye Jethani makes the following assertion about Christian Nationalists: They’re told over and over and over again that “you’re in danger and you need to be more afraid. The enemy is wokeism, it’s CRT, it’s liberals. It’s all these things that are dismantling America.” And it’s a really clear narrative: “Join us and you’ll have purpose and here’s your enemy.” Change the names, and how much does this message differ from those offered by many of those on the Left? The issue is not whether Christian Nationalism exists — and many conservatives, including myself, do not subscribe to the movement. The real questions are how prevalent it truly is and to what degree it will influence the next election. Setting aside Biden’s disastrous appearance last week, almost every conservative I know, including myself, was alarmed by Biden’s infamous “Red Speech.” Many saw that address as a blanket indictment of and warning about all conservatives, using a MAGA brush. God & Country would have the viewer believe that there is a wild-eyed Trump supporter hiding under every conservative bed, waiting for their cue to commence operations. It is an attempt at a 21 st Century Red Scare. Literally. French and Moore’s involvement in the film may be motivated by something beyond saving the soul of a nation. Writing at First Things , Meghan Basham reports that French and Moore have teamed with Duke Divinity consulting professor Curtis Chang to create a study for church groups called “The After Party.” The trio realized they would have difficulty pitching a progressive group study to evangelical Christian funders and turned to the Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors’ New Pluralists project. Another donor is the One America Movement. The various benefactors of “The After Party” have supported promoting “the leadership of rural LGBTQ+ people” and “keeping fossil fuels in the ground” to prevent climate change. They have also advocated for abortion access and gender-affirming care for young people. (READ MORE: The Evangelical Divide ) In America, one is free to support and promote whatever causes one cares about. The above-mentioned efforts do not often find homes in evangelical settings unless they are introduced subtly and under different flags. Small group curricula are staples of many churches, particularly those in the Evangelical movement, and present just such an opportunity. Basham points out that the aim is not to purge the church of politics but of the “wrong” kind of politics under the banner of being a better Christian: Creating a Bible study curriculum to teach churches how to engage politics is, by nature, a political act. That’s even truer if you’ve turned for financial support to unbelievers committed to advancing left-wing policies. If these critics of conservative evangelicals are correct that their Trump-voting brothers and sisters are sick with political obsession, then they have the same disease. One would be hard-pressed to identify evangelical voices who’ve done more to bring a divisive focus on politics into the pews — all under the pretense of de-escalation and bipartisanship. Not every Christian conservative, even those who may support the 45 th President in the upcoming election, is interested in establishing a theocracy or the apotheosis of Donald J. Trump. In my experience, the majority of them are not. Many have an almost acute aversion to politics, at least outwardly. This may be due to the fact that they do not want an incursion by the world disrupting their church services or Bible studies. It may be because they do not want to frighten away potential seekers. The film does highlight the fact that there is a cadre of believers who hold that we are living in the End Times and that the Rapture and/or the Second Coming are nigh. And that assertion was accurate. However, many Christians, especially those who make up the target audience of God & Country, are susceptible to societal peer pressure. They may not be “of the world,” but they have to live in the world, or at the very least, live unmolested by it. Witness the popularity of “Duck Dynasty.” Christians everywhere were jubilant that a show about people who shared their beliefs was popular. While the mass appeal of the show began to wane, books by the members of the Robertson clan continued to appear on the shelves of Christian bookstores, even as beach towels bearing the image of Uncle Si with his teacup were finding their way to the bargain bins at Walmart. For a brief time, contemporary Christianity was cool. With the death of George Floyd and the rise of BLM and CRT, I saw several rural Evangelical Christians post the now-famous Black Square on social media and adopt decidedly left-wing stances. That was the direction in which the world was drifting at the time, and these people were terrified of being seen as standing on the proverbial wrong side of history. This is especially true of believers who came of age in the era of Post-Modern Christianity and were raised on the top-ten list at K-LOVE. (READ MORE: We Built Ugly Churches and Still Do Not Attract Young People: How Is This Possible? ) One may accurately surmise that these are the people at whom God & Country is aimed. The film is a 90-minute campaign ad designed to play on the fears of believers who may be suffering a crisis of conscience. These believers may think that they can retain their Christian identity while still meeting the ever-shifting demands of the secular, progressive, and popular culture. In some ways, It is the ultimate expression of the “Jesus is my boyfriend” mindset. It offers all of the “warm fuzzies” that come with being a member of the new Elect without the need for discernment. Ultimately, God & Country was a disappointment. I went into it thinking, somewhat quixotically, that I might have my worldview challenged. Self-examination is necessary, if sometimes uncomfortable. Instead, I heard shouts from the echo chamber, with a strongly implied warning that any political stance other than progressivism is not only wrong but dangerous."
"1","T he framers of our Constitution understood that governmental power can be misused for partisan purposes. Therefore, they carefully designed a national government of limited powers, with separation of powers, and checks and balances. Unfortunately, later generations gradually removed most of the safeguards they had painstakingly built into our constitution: As I’ve written in TAS previously, “When government grows that big and powerful, politicians will find a way to warp power for their own ends.” (READ MORE from E. Donald Elliott: It Should Be Illegal for Politicians to Buy Votes With Our Money ) Joe Biden and Co. have perfected techniques for using the expanded powers of the modern Administrative State to funnel money to their political supporters. First, Biden mandated by Executive Order that “at least” 40 percent of the $329 billion supposedly meant to fight climate change was to be directed to “disadvantaged communities” populated by racial minorities that voted overwhelmingly for Biden in the last election. Next Biden tried to “forgive” $430 billion in student loan debt, a blatantly illegal move that was eventually set aside by the Supreme Court — but the political damage had been done. Democrats got a double benefit with younger voters in the runup to the 2022 elections: they got credit for trying to give younger voters a $430 billion payoff, but then those nasty Republicans on the Supreme Court took away their gift. Now comes Election Payoffs Part Three, which dwarfs the previous two: Biden and Co. are now trying to weaponize the enormous regulatory power of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an agency for which I once served as General Counsel , in order to shovel billions of dollars in contingent fees to the plaintiffs’ trial lawyers. Such plaintiffs’ lawyers are big contributors to political campaigns with 99 percent of their contributions going to Democrats according to one study. Here’s how the latest scam to use your money to buy Biden’s re-election works. The EPA proposed a rule to regulate extremely low levels of “per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances” (PFAS), a large class of chemicals used in a variety of consumer products . If adopted, the EPA’s proposed new rule would limit the levels of certain PFAS compounds in drinking water down to the unimaginably low level of 4 parts per trillion — which is equivalent to just four grains of sand in an Olympic size swimming pool . Meanwhile, the EPA quietly removed several PFAS compounds from its “Safer Choice” list of recommended ingredients for consumer products. (READ MORE: The Left Does Not Believe in the Rule of Law ) If adopted, the EPA’s proposed rule for PFAS in drinking water may be the most expensive rule in the EPA’s history. The direct cost to water utilities to comply is estimated by the EPA at “only” about $1 billion per year, but the American Water Works Association (AWWA) says it would actually cost $3.8 billion per year . How much this will cost the average American family varies from a high of about $10,000 extra per year to a low of about $100 per year depending upon the size of their water supply system, as shown in the chart below from an analysis by the distinguished engineering consulting firm Black & Veatch for AWWA: However, the direct costs to comply are only a small part of the total costs of the proposed rule. A much bigger expense is that “the maximum contaminant levels that the EPA sets [for drinking water] will become target cleanup levels at Superfund sites and de facto cleanup levels at other sites.” (This results from an arcane aspect of Superfund law called the ARAR principle, which is explained here .) This one-two gut punch is likely to push several major U.S. chemical companies essential to our national defense into bankruptcy . Think I am exaggerating? One company, 3M, has already reached a settlement for $10 billion (yes, with a B) to settle only part of its PFAS liability. Time magazine says that was “ just the tip of the iceberg ” with plenty more to come. PFAS lawsuits will be a bonanza for plaintiffs’ lawyers, who typically take 20–33 percent of recoveries as their contingent fees. This multi-billion-dollar wealth transfer might be defensible if eliminating low levels of PFAS from drinking water really would save thousands of lives, but not a single study cited by the EPA actually shows any harm to human health from exposure to low levels of PFAS, including exposures to PFAS many times higher than the EPA’s proposed 4 part per trillion limit . Rather, the EPA relies on a few studies that show no toxic effects but only “subclinical effects,” which are measurable changes in bodily functions within the range otherwise considered normal. (I am not a scientist, so I have checked with three Ph.D. toxicologists who all confirmed that my understanding is correct.) (READ MORE: The Worst Supreme Court Decision in History ) The EPA’s proposed new rule for the U.S. would be hundreds of times more stringent than what most other countries worldwide consider a safe level . That’s not industry propaganda but the conclusion of an international collaboration of independent scientists that recently won the prize as the best scientific paper of the year from a section of the prestigious Society of Toxicology. Slide from January 22, 2024 Shubik Lecture to the Toxicology Forum by Dennis Paustenbach Ph.D, DABT, FATS. Even the EPA’s own very slanted analysis of costs and benefits shows that the alleged benefits barely exceed the EPA’s greatly understated estimates of costs . Those costs will be paid for by everyone who drinks water, including you. The burdens are particularly crushing for smaller water systems and low-income areas. Tables 7-1 and 9-13 buried in the EPA’s 374-page economic analysis shows that the costs for these areas will exceed the benefits, even assuming the EPA’s exaggerated estimate of benefits. Getting bored by the technical details? Keep reading; the proponents of this huge waste of your money are counting on all the technical gobbledygook to prevent you and the rest of the public from understanding that you are being ripped off big time. The extremely low levels of risk from PFAS in drinking water and consumer products — if indeed there is any real risk at all — could not be the basis for successful personal injury lawsuits against the PFAS manufacturers and companies because plaintiffs would ordinarily have to prove in court that their alleged injuries are more probable than not to result from exposure to PFAS. So how to magically turn extremely low risks that do not meet the “more probable than not” test into a gravy train for lawyers? Get the EPA to regulate on a very precautionary basis and then sue the manufacturers for the additional costs of compliance. Think the courts will save us from this regulatory atrocity as they did for student loan forgiveness? Think again. The lower courts have developed a doctrine called Baltimore Gas & Electric deference, after a 1983 case by that same name, in which the Supreme Court made a passing remark that “[w]hen examining this kind of scientific determination [making predictions, within its area of special expertise] at the frontiers of science as opposed to simple findings of fact, a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.” The lower courts have turned that casual one-liner into a legal doctrine that requires judges to give “super-deference ” to agency judgments “on the frontiers of science.” I call this “no look judicial review,” and have advocated its abolition in an academic paper , but for now, that pernicious doctrine is still on the books; it gives judges an excuse to save themselves time and trouble by rubber stamping technical judgments like those in the EPA’s PFAS rulemaking. The only remaining line of the defense against such abuses of regulatory power is the White House Office of Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), now headed by Richard Revesz, former Dean of NYU Law School and an eminent lawyer-economist whose confirmation on a bi-partisan basis I supported publicly. The EPA’s proposed PFAS rule is now undergoing final review at OIRA, and most of the needless expense could be avoided by setting a more reasonable limit, such as in the 20-to-40 parts-per-trillion range, while still fully protecting public health. However, making that change would probably require the EPA to repropose the rule for another round of public comment because that was not one of the options in the EPA’s original proposal, and OIRA is under a lot of pressure to get it out before a May 22 deadline so that it cannot be reconsidered by the next Congress under the Congressional Review Act after the November elections. Let’s hope that OIRA, the Congress, or the courts come to their senses and see this for what it is — a big payoff to the plaintiffs’ trial lawyers at your expense — with little or no benefit to public health.

"1","Russian President Vladimir Putin loves to mock the United States and everything we do. His poker-faced announcement that he has endorsed Joe Biden in the 2024 election was more than just mockery. Putin’s statement was a factual condemnation of Biden’s presidency. Putin said he prefers Old Joe over former president Trump because Joe is an old school politician with more experience than Trump. Remember, please that Obama’s first Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, said in his 2014 memoir that Biden had been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue for the past forty years. In the decade since, Biden has only maintained that record. Remember, too, that when Obama was deciding on the Navy SEAL raid that culminated in the killing of Usama bin Laden, Biden was the only person in the room who tried to talk him out of it. (READ MORE from Jed Babbin: Biden Blackmails Israel ) That, of course, is the foundation of the real reason Putin endorsed Joe. He did so, in Putin’s word, because Biden is more “predictable.” He certainly is, but only in the ways our enemies find advantageous. Consider Joe’s major accomplishments. Biden said in his last campaign that he wanted to end our “forever wars.” When Biden created a debacle by suddenly withdrawing from Afghanistan in August 2021 he — predictably — left behind dozens (hundreds?) of Americans and our Afghan allies to the Taliban’s mercies. And he abandoned several billions of dollars in U.S. military equipment that the Taliban found immediately useful. Putin and the Taliban — not to mention the ayatollahs in Iran — must have found that action quite amusing. As Fox News and others have reported over and over, Biden’s predictable action in opening our southern border has let approximately eight million illegal aliens into our country. Among them are the about 1.5 million “getaways” — people who have evaded the Border Patrol — many of whom have the intention of spying, committing acts of terrorism, and otherwise damaging our nation. The illegals now charged with beating up New York City police officers are allegedly members of the hyper-violent Venezuelan “Tren de Araugua” gang. And they are only the latest example. Fox News’ Griff Jenkins and Bill Melugin have reported that hundreds of Chinese illegals have come in. It’s obvious to all but Biden and his border chieftain Alejandro Mayorkas that many must be members of the Peoples’ Liberation Army or employees of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, their principle spy agency. Putin must be chuckling at the “wokeness” that Biden has imposed on the U.S. military. He promotes generals who are deeply invested in wokeness and the military academies are teaching it. Don’t forget the Navy’s initiative last year — following the success of Bud Light — when it was recruiting enlisted people — unsuccessfully — using a transgender sailor. (READ MORE: Foreseeable Consequences ) Last week, the Navy announced, in what passes for a major initiative these days, that sailors will henceforth be allowed to keep their hands in their pockets and wear false eyelashes. Old Vladimir must have really enjoyed that one. As this column has said — repeatedly — our generals and admirals should be concerned only with the lethality and readiness of our forces. All of Biden’s actions detract from both. And there’s not a whisper of concern from the people Biden has put in charge of our military. (Don’t forget that when Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin went missing for several days that no one — including Biden — missed him. If Donald Rumsfeld or Bill Perry or Frank Carlucci or Dick Cheney went missing for more than ten minutes, their presidents would have noticed.) Putin’s mind never wanders far from his goal of re-establishing the Soviet empire. As I’ve written elsewhere, Putin is a disciple of Alexandr Dugin. As Dugin wrote in his seminal work, “The Foundations of Geopolitics,” if Ukraine isn’t brought under Russian dominance, he may as well not bother with the other countries that made up the Soviet empire. As the late Abba Eban wrote about the Palestinians, Biden never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity. When the Polish government asked his permission to send about a dozen MiG-29 fighters to Ukraine in March 2022, Biden — predictably — objected and the aircraft weren’t sent. They could have, possibly, made the difference between victory for Ukraine and defeat. We’ll never know. Biden has never articulated the need to help Ukraine, so the American public is left to wonder and Republicans are, for reasons known only to them, blocking further aid. If Biden were a leader he would have made at least a few major speeches setting out the case for aid to Ukraine, but he hasn’t and what he has said has fallen on deaf ears. Russia is making progress in its effort to conquer. In the latest attack, Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from the city of Avdiivka. That, in all likelihood, isn’t the result of the U.S. aid withheld so far, but our failure to help the Ukrainians will only help Putin. Biden’s predictability is factored into all our enemies’ calculations. Perhaps the worst proof of that is his pressure on Israel to accept a “peace” deal that would leave the Hamas terrorists in power in the Gaza Strip. He reportedly called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an a**hole in a recent conversation when Netanyahu refused to accept Biden’s terms. For Israel to accept Biden’s terms, it would have to agree not only to leaving Hamas in power in Gaza but also to accept a Palestinian state, the so- called “two-state” solution. Netanyahu said that giving the Palestinians their own state would be a “grand prize” for terrorism. (READ MORE: Biden’s Random Bombings ) Biden has gone so far as to make further aid to Israel dependent on its obeying all U.S. humanitarian laws. Those aspects of the existential war Israel is fighting are beyond reason but Biden’s insistence is proof positive that, as Putin said, Biden is an old school pol. Iran is close to developing nuclear weapons. How will Biden prevent that? He won’t and at this stage he can’t. Will he defend Taiwan against a likely Chinese invasion? He has said he would four times and his minions have each time backed away from his promise. Biden is, as Putin said, predictable. In the olden days of the Reagan administration, our enemies knew there were boundaries to acceptable actions and they never knew how strongly the Old Cowboy would react. Predictability is not a characteristic that a president should be known for. Biden’s predictability and his “old school” approach to defense and national security makes this nation less safe."
"1","T he traditional definition of “writer’s block” is a “condition in which an author loses the ability to produce.” It once exclusively applied to the writer’s own creative slowdown. For modern conservative scribes, however, it extends to the actual obstacles that the publishing and entertainment industries throw in their way. The entertainment establishment’s longtime liberal bias became full-fledged blacklisting during the Obama years, when I realized my Hollywood career was over. At the time, I could comprehend the professional obstruction of traditionalist storytellers. The Left understood the importance of cultural control to ideological supremacy a half century before the Right did. And art was the gateway. Conservatives generally avoided politicizing the arts for two reasons. First, fewer of them ever entered the field, having lives to live, families to raise, and frontiers to explore, so they preferred to enjoy screen product rather than create it. Second, they instinctively knew that the best stories are conservative. (READ MORE from Lou Aguilar: The Decline and Fall of Hollywoke ) Because they’re about good versus evil, and good — despite shades of grey — is moral, loving, religious, civilized, and above all realistic. While evil is dysfunctional anti-human utopian fantasy that always leads to societal misery. See Marxism, baby- killing abortion, women-depressing feminism, butcherous “transgenderism,” anti-white racism, legal crime, legal border invasion, and the hellscape every formerly spectacular major American city has become under Democratic rule. A new ABC analysis found that nearly all of the strong economic growth in the country comes from conservative Red states that voted for Trump, have lower taxes, better education, and tougher law enforcement. The ludicrous leftist media spin credited none of these factors, instead citing the warm weather and Blue governance within these states. Which doesn’t explain the total devolution of Los Angeles or the success of Miami. Neither can woke storytellers, a big reason why Hollywood is imploding. Their diverse progressive heroes and manly heroines only repel the finally awake traditional audience. They can’t create any character as popular as James Bond, Luke Skywalker, Spiderman, or Jack Sparrow. They can only replace, emasculate, or feminize them while leeching off the universes they could never form. (READ MORE: The Woke of Zorro ) This is how you get a sexless Daniel Craig Bond (and have to kill him off), an unfit Rey (Daisy Ridley) in Star Wars , a ridiculous Madame Web (the Spiderverse installment getting laughed off the screen last weekend), and a black female pirate instead of Jack Sparrow in a future Pirates of the Caribbean entry. The producers know these movies will bomb, even suspect the hostility to them outside their liberal bubble, but they can’t change course. Or rescue their projects by firing leftist diversity-hire writers and hiring conservative ones like me. We know how to reinvigorate James Bond, Star Wars , Marvel, and Disney. Give the men back their guts and the women their romance and sex appeal. Respect what made classic heroes so special and don’t try to “modernize” them for the snowflake crowd. Even more incredible, we can create original characters and exciting stories that will launch new franchises and bring in new fans. And we don’t need Hollywood. I sure don’t. After I left LA last decade, I switched to my first love — fiction — and became a successful novelist. I wrote three books, all published and well received, one, Paper Tigers , adapted from a politically incorrect yet hot script that died the day Obama was elected. For my fourth novel, I entered my favorite literary genre, the detective thriller. I did not lack for inspiring role models going back to the nineteenth century — Charles Dickens’ Inspector Bucket ( Bleak House ), Wilkie Collins’ sergeant Cuff ( The Moonstone ), Edgar Allan Poe’s C. August Dupin ( The Purloined Letter ), Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot, and others. But for my own contribution, I turned to the all-American immortal private-eye heroes, Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade, Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe, Ross Macdonald’s Lew Archer, Robert B. Parker’s Spenser, Andrew Klavan’s Cameron Winter. What they did for San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Boston, making the cities almost another character, I tried to do for Washington DC, with all its political skullduggery. It was the most challenging fiction job I ever undertook. The mystery writer not only has to advance the plot and be stylish, he has to seamlessly leave clues that aren’t a cheat such as the butler did it. Not only this, I made the novel not just non-woke but anti-woke enough to make AOC shriek. Unfortunately, I knew, so would the majority of literary agents and top publishers, infested by cultural Marxism. Many of them wanted “feminist, gay” material, some even asked for pronouns. (READ MORE: Look What They’ve Done to My Song ) I did get one funny pass from one independent publisher, The Book Folks: “Hi, Lou. Thanks for getting in touch. However, we are a sorry bunch of woke, god-fearing atheists, who believe in social justice and the demise and eternal damnation of the political right. May gremlins put jam in their shoes. So I don’t think we’d be the right fit for you.” I soon found a great publisher for my novel — Aethon Books. My pleasure turned to tension when they said they do really well with trilogies, and could I write two more in the detective “series” one year apart? So, if I end up in an opium den like Edgar Allan Poe, you’ll know the challenge was accepted. In any case, look for the exciting political thriller, The Apocalypse Mask , hopefully this fall. And help break the conservative writer’s block."
"1","Why would a president running for reelection refuse to meet with the Speaker of the House to discuss a national crisis that most voters blame on the president himself? This would be regarded as bizarre behavior under any circumstances, but it’s particularly perverse considering that the crisis in question is illegal immigration — the signature issue of Biden’s probable challenger in November. Moreover, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average , 63 percent of the voters disapprove of the way he has handled immigration. Yet Biden refuses to discuss the problem. It’s almost as if he thinks it somehow works to his advantage. What benefit could Biden derive from letting millions of illegal immigrants into the country? House speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) provided the most plausible answer during a recent appearance on Fox Business Network’s Mornings with Maria Bartiromo : “I genuinely believe that originally the idea was to bring people in, open the border, have the flow come in and turn them into voters, there’s no other reason that seems to make sense.” Predictably, this has been dismissed as a conspiracy theory by the White House, congressional Democrats, and their allies in the legacy media. Yet Biden himself has often made public statements that suggest Johnson is right. In 2016, when he was Vice President, he stated his position thus : You know, 11 million people live in the shadows. I believe they’re already American citizens. Teddy Roosevelt said it better: “Americanism is not a question of birthplace or creed or a line of descent. It’s a question of principles, idealism, and character.” These people are just waiting for a chance to contribute fully. And by that standard, 11 million undocumented aliens are already Americans, in my view. All they want — they just want a decent life for their kids, a chance to contribute to a free society, a chance to put down roots and help build the next great American century. Setting aside Biden’s implausibly low estimate of the “undocumented alien” population (researchers from Yale and MIT estimate the actual 2016 figure was more like 22.1 million ), the key words that relate to voting are “contribute fully.” It will come as no surprise that serious research into how many of Biden’s “citizens” vote is very much discouraged in academia. In 2014, for example, a peer-reviewed article authored by Jesse T. Richman and Gushan A. Chattha, both of Old Dominion University, and David C. Earnest of George Mason University estimated that about 25 percent of non-citizens were registered to vote in 2008 and 2010. Moreover, they suggest that as many as 2.8 million of them actually voted. (READ MORE from David Catron: Biden’s Sound and Fury ) Inevitably, the “vote fraud is rare” crowd descended on the authors of the study like so many flying monkeys. Their criticisms predictably focus on when and why they published their study rather than its findings. They suggest the study was purposely produced to provide fuel to “conspiracy theorists.” They also accuse the authors of timing it to affect the 2014 midterms. The article was published in the online version of Electoral Studies on September 21 — about five weeks before Election Day. It’s unlikely that this publication is included in the regular reading of your average voter. Richman and Earnest wrote a lengthy response to their critics in the Washington Post . Their general thrust goes more or less as follows: Our blog post and article on non- citizen voting have reached a wide audience, and have motivated several efforts to dispute our methods and conclusions … Although our estimates of non-citizen registration and voting are higher than previous estimates, this should not be surprising. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to use survey data to estimate non-citizen voting, while other studies have relied upon incidents of detected vote fraud. Estimates of illegal behavior based upon survey data are frequently higher than estimates based upon detection rates. This final point is driven home by the known level of detection rates for illegal voting. The Heritage Foundation maintains an Election Fraud Database that presents a sampling of recent instances of election fraud cases that have resulted in convictions. It does not purport to be exhaustive but it does contain the details of 1,276 criminal convictions many involving large scale ballot harvesting operations, vote buying schemes, and ineligible voting by non-citizens. However, because academic grant money for major research into any kind of election fraud is all but nonexistent, serious studies like the one discussed above are rarely conducted, leaving most American voters in the dark about how many illegal immigrants vote. (READ MORE: Trump’s Swing State Challenge ) All of which brings us back to President Biden’s refusal to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson about the border crisis. In May of 2023, the Republican House passed H.R. 2, the “Secure the Border Act,” which would codify the mechanisms used by former President Trump to successfully control the border. It has been collecting dust in the Democrat-controlled Senate for nine months. Meanwhile, the Senate has produced an alternative bill that would make the current border crisis permanent. This is the legislation Biden supports. Typically, the President would meet with the House Speaker and work out a compromise. The White House, however, says there is nothing to negotiate. It’s Biden’s way or the highway. (READ MORE: Is This What Biden Meant By ‘Unity’? ) Or is it Biden’s way? During the Fox interview discussed above , House Speaker Mike Johnson said, “I don’t think he’s allowed to do it. I’m not sure Biden’s actually making these decisions.” This may be true, but it is by no means inconsistent with his past positions. In the end, the Democrats may well have reached the conclusion that they can’t stay in power with legal votes by natural born or naturalized citizens. If this is true, it means they see uncontrolled illegal immigration as a feature rather than a bug of the Biden border policy. In the final analysis, they couldn’t care less who votes as long they remain in power."
"1","Republicans have increased their odds of winning back the U.S. Senate as former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced that he is running for the seat left vacant by retiring Senator Ben Cardin. This surprise move by Hogan is a strategic recruitment victory by the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as blue state Maryland joins a winnable electoral map that favors Senate Republicans in a presidential election year. The popular former two-term Republican governor left office with a 77 percent approval rating and considered running for Senate in 2022, but he declined . His repeated criticism of former Donald Trump led many pundits to speculate he would run as a third-party candidate ticket for “No Labels .” However, his endorsement of former Ambassador Nikki Haley for president clarified that he still wants to be a voice in the Republican Party. (READ MORE from Alex Adkins: San Francisco Swings and Misses on Crime, Theft, and Shohei Ohtani) In his announcement video, Hogan called for an end to petty partisanship, stating, “Washington is completely broken because that kind of leadership, that kind of willingness to put country over party, has become far too rare.” He offered a stern, pragmatic approach, saying, “I don’t come from the performative art school of politics. I come from the get to work and get things done school, and I’ll work with anyone who wants to do the people’s business.”. According to CNN political director David Chalian, Larry Hogan’s entrance into Maryland’s senate race is “Chuck Schumer’s nightmare.” As it currently stands, The Senate is 51-49 in favor of Democrats, but they are defending 23 of 34 seats in this year’s election. States like Ohio, Montana, and West Virginia are all states that Trump won in 2016 and 2020 and look to be prime pickups for Republicans in this race. Now, add Maryland into the mix as a new potential pickup. Republicans only need to flip two seats to deny Chuck Schumer his majority leadership. Winning Maryland has never been easy for Republicans. The last Republican senator to win an election in the Old Line state was Charles Mathias in 1980. President Joe Biden beat former President Trump by over 30 points in the most recent presidential election. Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 2-1 margin , which makes it difficult for any Republican to win. Hogan won his first race for governor in 2014 in an upset against then-Lt. Governor Anthony Brown. He prevailed in a landslide in his reelection to a second term as governor. Interestingly enough, in 2018, Senator Ben Cardin ran for reelection and won 65 percent of the vote in Maryland, while Governor Hogan won his election by 12 points on the same ballot. It suggests that he’s the type of Republican who can win over moderates, independents, and a decent amount of Democratic voters. Running for governor is an entirely different dynamic than running for U.S. Senate. No ex- governor has won the Senate since Herbert Romulus O’Conor in 1946 . Republican governors have difficulty winning senate races due to the nationalization of federal issues, and the same is true for democratic governors. (READ MORE: Freedom Conservatives: A Stand Against Progressivism and Populism ) Not only does Larry Hogan have an excellent name ID as a successful two-term ex- governor, but his dad, former representative Larry Hogan Sr., was a well-known congressman who represented the eastern portion of D.C. and was known for impeaching President Nixon as a party member. In Hogan’s announcement video, he shared his dad’s willingness to put country over party. This approach is paying off so far. According to an independent poll from The Baltimore Banner, Governor Hogan is beating his most likely opponent, Angela Alsobrooks, 42 percent to 36 percent. Inside Elections has shifted the race from Solid Democratic to Likely Democratic. American United Inc., a Hogan-based nonprofit issue advocacy group, raised around $975,000 in 2022 and spent $1.8 million to promote Hogan further nationally. Republicans pouring in financial resources forces Democrats to spend more money in Maryland instead of allocating that money to more critical races. Hogan has never run in a presidential election. His feud with Trump at the top of the ticket could hurt him with Republican voters who see him as a squish. Nikki Haley would be the perfect nominee as she polls strongly with independent voters. Matthew Foldi of Spectator believes Republicans will come home for Hogan because “Republicans are tired of losing .” (READ MORE: Doug Ducey: The Right’s New Free-Market Champion) The stakes for control of the U.S. Senate have never been higher as Democrats plan to pass D.C. statehood, pack the court, and end the filibuster with an expanded majority. Republicans have been reeling in losses these last few election cycles because they ran bad candidates in winnable races. Larry Hogan will never be the most conservative senator, but he is a good Republican senator for a state like Maryland and can win."
"1","MEMORANDUM DATE: February 19, 2024 FROM: Lee Atwater, Republican Party strategist (1951-1991) TO: Donald J. Trump, Republican Presidential nominee RE: 2024 Presidential Election vs. Biden I read about the NBC News national poll that had you leading Joe Biden 47 percent to 42 percent in the presidential race. More importantly, you lead Biden on many key issues, including the border, the economy, competence, having the mental and physical health to be president, crime, and improving America’s standing in the world. Biden only leads on abortion. On Biden’s signature issue — he claims he is better at “protecting democracy” — the electorate is split. And Biden’s approval rating is heavily underwater at 37 percent. Even worse, Biden’s three-year average approval is only 40 percent. Matter of fact — like Yogi Bera said, it’s déjà vu, all over again. In 1980, Jimmy Carter was in pretty much in the same spot. And as you remember, Carter lost. (READ MORE from Adam Turner: The Ghost of Thurlow Weed Seeks Out Donald Trump ) I believe that if you play things right, Joe Biden will be the new Jimmy Carter. I know that Joe Biden is worried about this. That is why he is acting so desperate, and making such a big deal about “protecting democracy.” And why he will also continue to call you a racist, a Nazi, and a dictator. I’ll tell you what. In 1980, Jimmy Carter was worried too. He said Ronald Reagan was a racist, a Nazi, a right- wing fanatic, and a warmonger. Carter was so obviously out of his mind, that after a while, no one took him seriously. Barbara Walters characterized him as “vindictive, hysterical, and on the point of desperation.” And even then, the mainstream media was not the friend of Republicans, and they were always looking for opportunities to bring us down. So, ignore this kind of baloney coming from Biden. As Slick Willie would say , it couldn’t be used to sell p#$y on a troop train. The one political hit they do have with some force behind it, is abortion. There, you are doing what you need to do, by moving to the middle. Keep on doing this. The Democrats are going to get some traction on abortion, with people who really care about this issue. Don’t waste your time trying to convince these folks, who will never be convinced by you. Stay in the middle, focus on eliminating late-term abortion and exemptions for rape and incest, with your supporters and swing voters in mind. In the end, abortion won’t be enough for Biden. Other than that, the Biden team is reduced to hoping for one of their partisan law cases to come through. Once again, keep doing what you are doing — talk about how this is all BS partisan politics. Politics is all about narratives, and you have already crafted a compelling narrative, which the people are listening to. Because it is true. You also have a break with the timing of the cases against you. The one most likely to be tried during this election year is the case from New York. If that Soros prosecutor Bragg completes it, you and I both know you will be convicted by the biased left-wing jury. But the Bragg case is incredibly weak, obviously partisan, and all about sex. And what did my old friend Jim Carville say about Presidential sex scandals? “In my world, you don’t abandon a guy over sex. You stick with him.” That advice should work for your voters, and those in the middle, too. The Bragg case — that dog won’t hunt. Let me tell you something. I have always believed that fear is a powerful motivator in politics. The American people are afraid this year, because the economy has fallen apart, prices are through the roof, and the international scene is in chaos. The American people also fear that Joe Biden, who his own Department of Justice thinks is too old and senile to be indicted for his multiple crimes, isn’t up to the job of being President. (READ MORE: A Letter From Lincoln to Donald Trump ) But you are. So, like some others have said , you should be hitting Biden hard on his economy, his foreign weakness, and his corruption. You should be comparing his sorry job as President to your jam-up job. And most especially, you should be pounding him on the fact that his lights are on, but nobody’s home. The U.S. needs a president who is as sharp as a tack, as stubborn as a mule, and a bull in the China shop, in order to make Congress listen to the people, and to scare off the foreign buzzards circling, such as Russia, China, and Iran. Americans also want someone who can fight the deep state. They want someone like you. Now, let’s talk about your “mean tweets” and other colorful commentary. I agree with the others that you should pretty much hush up. You never want to get caught up in a whopper. And if you really need to say something mean, then use an escape route — give it to Junior. A president needs to be presidential. You should also be pickier about who you fight with. Don’t punch down on people whose support you might want. But, at the same time, don’t apologize for who you are. Never show weakness, as it’s a sign of vulnerability. Instead, just shrug off those “mean tweet” attacks, and tell them that this is how you are — you are a fighter — and the U.S. needs a fighter in the White House. Now, more than ever. If you do all this, that is going to be enough to win ugly. And winning ugly is still winning. The debates are going to be a hoot. Biden said no, of course. That is because, as the Department of Justice just said, the old goat’s way past his prime. He will make up some excuse why he won’t debate; but nobody will believe him. They have eyes and ears. You need to make Biden own his weaknesses. As in 1980, there are going to be some 3 rd party candidates running. So, when Biden ducks, hides, and crawfishes, you should agree to appear on the stage with all the candidates who are on the ballot. (After all, polling shows that you benefit from the 3 rd parties.) Just like Reagan debated with Anderson. All the nation’s attention will be focused on the debate, and on you, the one candidate with a real chance to win. If you perform well enough, as Reagan did, Hidin’ Biden might be forced to join the next debate. But I doubt it — he can’t even talk plain. And, of course, you already know what your closing statement on the debate stage is going to be: The American people need to ask themselves some questions. Are we better off now than we were four years ago? Is it easier for us to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is it cheaper for us to buy gas for our cars? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do we feel that we are as safe, secure, and as strong as we were four years ago? And can Joe Biden, the guy who can’t remember what he did yesterday, struggles to communicate and walk, the president who is going to take us back to those better days? The answer to all of these questions is “no.” I am the only candidate who can bring us back to where we want to go. That is why I am running — to Make America Great Again. Everyone is expecting you to say this, because it so fitting. And Biden has no good reply to it. And, sometimes, you need to give the people what they want. Say hey to Roger from me. Harvey LeRoy “Lee” Atwater (February 27, 1951 – March 29, 1991) was a Southern based United States political consultant and strategist for the Republican Party. He was an adviser to Republican U.S. presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and chairman of the Republican National Committee. He still resides in an undisclosed location down in the deepest part of the South, where it is hot all the time, and where there are plenty of other American politicians to keep him company."
"2","On February 28, the Supreme Court will hear a case that could effectively make it legal for civilians to own automatic weapons capable of firing as many as nine bullets every second . The case, known as Garland v. Cargill , involves bump stocks, devices that use a gun’s recoil to repeatedly fire the weapon. Bump stocks cause a semiautomatic firearm’s trigger to buck against the shooter’s finger, as the gun’s recoil causes it to jerk back and forth — repeatedly “bumping” the trigger and causing the gun to fire as if it were fully automatic. A “semiautomatic” weapon refers to a gun that loads a bullet into the chamber or otherwise prepares itself to fire again after discharging a bullet, but that will not fire a second bullet until the shooter pulls the trigger a second time. An “automatic” weapon, by contrast, will fire a continuous stream of bullets — though the shooter often must hold down the trigger to do so. The Trump administration issued a regulation banning bump stocks in 2018, after a gunman used one to kill 60 people and wound hundreds more during a country music festival in Las Vegas. A 1986 law makes it a crime to own a “machinegun,” and the Trump administration determined that this law extends to bump stocks. But federal courts have divided on whether federal law defines the term “machinegun” broadly enough to include bump stocks, and the law does appear to be genuinely ambiguous on this point. If this case, which was brought by an individual gun owner who wants to own bump stocks, had arisen just a few years ago, it would have been a slam dunk victory for the government. The Supreme Court’s decision in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council (1984) generally calls for judges to defer to a federal agency’s reading of an ambiguous federal law, so Chevron calls for the courts to defer to the government’s interpretation of what constitutes a “machinegun.” But the Court is likely to overrule Chevron in a pair of cases it heard in January, shifting final authority over a simply enormous array of policy questions away from the executive branch of government and to the Court itself. And that means that the fate of the current ban on bump stocks most likely rests entirely upon whether five justices want such a ban to exist. The federal ban on automatic weapons is genuinely ambiguous Federal law defines a “machinegun” to include “any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.” The plaintiff in Cargill makes two separate arguments that this definition doesn’t extend to bump stocks. One of these arguments is fairly plausible, while the other is not. Starting with the plaintiff’s weaker argument, his lawyers claim that a gun equipped with a bump stock does not fire “automatically.” The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a far-right court that routinely issues dubiously reasoned decisions implementing conservative policy goals, agreed with this argument , concluding that the bump stocks at issue in this case do not allow automatic fire because they only function if the shooter maintains “manual, forward pressure on the barrel and manual, backward pressure on the trigger ledge.” The problem with this argument is that it proves far too much. If a gun cannot be an automatic weapon if it requires the shooter to maintain continuous pressure on some part of the gun, then virtually all automatic weapons do not qualify as “machineguns.” As the Justice Department explains in its brief to the justices, most traditional machine guns “ fire only by maintaining constant rearward pressure on the trigger ” — that is, the shooter must hold down the trigger or the gun stops firing. As the DOJ argues, there is “no meaningful difference” between a weapon that requires continuous pressure on the trigger and one that requires continuous pressure on some other part of the gun. Both types of guns should be considered automatic weapons because both kinds of guns continue firing until the shooter stops making the gun fire. The Cargill plaintiff’s stronger argument, meanwhile, turns on the federal law’s statement that a machine gun must engage in automatic fire “by a single function of the trigger.” Federal judges are quite divided on how to read this provision, which does appear to be genuinely ambiguous. Some courts, like the left-leaning DC Circuit, concluded that this reference to “a single function of the trigger” should be read to mean “a single pull of the trigger from the perspective of the shooter.” Thus, as that court said in Guedes v. ATF (2019), a semiautomatic weapon equipped with a bump stock counts as a machine gun because “the shooter engages in a single pull of the trigger with her trigger finger, and that action, via the operation of the bump stock, yields a continuous stream of fire as long she keeps her finger stationary and does not release it.” Alternatively, much of the Fifth Circuit concluded that a bump stock-equipped gun does not count as a machine gun because the trigger itself moves back and forth while such a gun is being fired. Although these judges conceded that bump stocks allow semiautomatic weapons to be rapidly fired, they claimed that “the fact remains that only one bullet is fired each time the shooter pulls the trigger .” So how should the Supreme Court resolve this ambiguity? Both sides of this case can point to competing rules guiding how statutes should be interpreted to support their preferred outcome. Many judges who’ve ruled against the bump stock ban point to something called the “ rule of lenity ” to justify that decision. Generally speaking, this rule establishes that, when a criminal law is ambiguous, it should be construed in favor of defendants. As the Supreme Court said in Rewis v. United States (1971), “ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.” But the rule of lenity is also a very weak peg to hang any legal decision upon. That’s because, in Barber v. Thomas (2010), the Supreme Court concluded that “the rule of lenity only applies if, after considering text, structure, history, and purpose, there remains a ‘grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute,’ such that the Court must simply ‘guess as to what Congress intended.’” The Justice Department, meanwhile, points to a rule known as the “ presumption against ineffectiveness ” to justify leaving the bump stock ban in place. This rule holds that statutes generally should not be construed in ways that aid in “evasion of the law.” It is also a very old rule. The DOJ’s brief cites a 200-year-old Supreme Court decision, known as The Emily and the Caroline (1824), which warns against reading laws in ways that would render “the law in a great measure nugatory and enable offenders to elude its provisions in the most easy manner.” (“Nugatory” means that the law is inoperative or unable to function.) “In construing a statute, penal as well as others,” the Court explained in The Emily , “we must look to the object in view, and never adopt an interpretation that will defeat its own purpose if it will admit of any other reasonable construction.” Thus, if a law can fairly be read in more than one way, a court should avoid reading it in a way that renders the law ineffective. There is some recent evidence, moreover, that a majority of the justices may be sympathetic to the DOJ’s argument that laws should not be read to make them ineffective — even though this very conservative Supreme Court tends to be sympathetic to arguments made by gun rights plaintiffs . Last August, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked a lower court’s decision permitting the sale of “ghost guns,” firearms that are sold in a dismantled state in order to evade certain federal gun laws. Federal law typically requires gun purchasers to submit to a background check, and it also requires guns to be marked with a serial number to help track the weapon if it is used in a crime. These requirements apply to “any weapon ... which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive .” To prevent gun sellers from evading this law by selling dismantled guns as individual parts, the same federal law also applies to “the frame or receiver of any such weapon,” the skeletal part of a firearm that houses other components, such as the barrel or trigger mechanism. Ghost guns seek to evade these requirements because they are sold dismantled, and the frame or receiver is sold incomplete — although often they can be completed with minimal work, such as drilling a single hole in the frame . In any event, a majority of the justices decided, in Garland v. VanDerStok , to block a lower court decision that would have allowed these ghost guns to be sold without background checks or serial numbers. VanDerStok was a 5-4 decision, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett crossing over to vote with the Court’s three Democratic appointees. So that’s, at least, some evidence that this Court will apply a presumption against ineffectiveness to gun laws like the one at issue in Cargill . Regardless, the bump stocks case does turn on a genuinely ambiguous provision of federal law. That means that, in a world without Chevron , the question of whether gun manufacturers can sell devices that evade the ban on machine guns will turn on which outcome a majority of the justices prefer.

"2","Jon Stewart’s return to The Daily Show has been, on the metrics, a success. According to Comedy Central, his first episode back on February 12 was watched by 1.85 million total viewers across premiere simulcasts and encores, up 110 percent from Trevor Noah’s final episode in 2022. It’s also a major improvement on Stewart’s last show. The Problem with Jon Stewart , which ran on Apple TV+ from 2021 to 2023, was routinely drawing in audiences as low as 40,000 people . “Jon Stewart” and “ The Daily Show” on their own are flawed brands. “Jon Stewart on The Daily Show ,” on the other hand? That’s a combination of such heady nostalgia that the viewers pour in. Still, Stewart’s first episode proved that his appeal is not just pure nostalgia. There is some kind of alchemy that occurs when Jon Stewart gets behind that old Daily Show desk. He knows the format of the show so well; he plays it like a virtuoso. He eases into his monologue with no rush, breaking out the same Borscht Belt voices and self-deprecating barbs he used to play with in 2015, talking in the same relaxed patter that builds to the same crescendo of righteousness. He is so delighted by the chance to play a gotcha reel (in this case, members of the Trump family repeating “I can’t recall” during depositions after a discussion of Biden’s allegedly failing memory ) that he almost manages to make the old trick feel new again. He almost manages to make you think, “Wow, Jon Stewart could have done something with the Trump era.” Almost. Jon Stewart’s great satirical gift is his ability to puncture hypocrisy, which is why he became one of the most trusted sources of news in America during the 2000s. George W. Bush was Stewart’s perfect foil: a president who talked of compassionate conservatism and grand existential battles of good versus evil while lying to the public and embroiling America in dirty, vicious wars that dragged on for decades . No one could puncture Bush’s pieties as well as Jon Stewart. Nothing was more satisfying to watch than Stewart’s mugging face, eyes wide with faux shock, next to a video montage that promised to expose, once and for all, that Bush administration doublespeak. Stewart’s version of The Daily Show lost some of its urgency during the Obama administration, as the brand of liberal centrism he championed ascended to cultural primacy and he lost his ability to position himself as the scrappy outsider unmasking a lying president. Still, most presidents have their hypocrisies, and Stewart found plenty to puncture during the Obama years: his initially tepid support of gay marriage , the drone warfare , the IRS targeting of Tea Party groups . He left The Daily Show in 2015, just before Trump became the Republican candidate and the liberal consensus worldview of Daily Show viewers shattered. Stewart, by and large, sat out the Trump years, so we don’t know for sure what his comedy would have looked like in that troubled era. We did, however, watch all the comedians who came up on The Daily Show try and fail to grapple with Trump, a president who never bothered to veil his indiscretions, who was so straightforwardly villainous that he had no hypocrisy there to be exposed. Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, John Oliver, Trevor Noah — the more they talked about Trump, the more they seemed to become less funny and more earnest. They could not make his actions more absurd by hyperbole. Sarcasm was no longer attractive to audiences , who craved clear demarcations between the comedians who were on their side and those on Trump’s side. Robbed of their most effective weapons, liberal comics ended up spending the Trump years like much of the left did: alternating between rage and tears. “For the last 20 years we [the left] have owned the cultural terrain of comedy and irony, arguably to good effect,” Nick Marx, a media scholar who studies political humor, told me in 2022. “The Trump era made liberals forget that. It made our comedians want to act like paternal figures who would pat us on the head.” As liberal comedy faltered, right-wing comedy rushed to fill the power vacuum. Conservative comedians now position themselves as the truly edgy and transgressive ones, the people speaking truth to the power of liberal elitists, the heirs apparent to the tradition begun by Jon Stewart. “There’s a rebelliousness in the way people think of this right- wing comedy, right?” Matt Sienkiewicz said in 2022. Sienkiewicz co-authored That’s Not Funny: How the Right Makes Comedy Work for Them alongside Marx. “Even if it really is regressive and pointing back to old dominant ideas. But it can be branded as being the opposite of Stephen Colbert crying about January 6 during his monologue, which is very much not cool to the teens.” Stewart’s return comes not during the Trump era but during the Biden presidency, just as the country begins to stare down the possibility of a second Trump term. Biden is the sort of traditional president Stewart excels at handling; it’s not surprising that the sharpest moment of his first episode came when he criticized Biden’s administration for trying to shame the press out of covering criticism of Biden’s age. But Stewart has yet to prove his ability to cover a man like Donald Trump , especially in a moment when the right has successfully positioned itself as the home of transgressive comedy. As good as Jon Stewart’s ratings were on his first night, The Daily Show wasn’t the most-watched show on late-night. Over on Fox News , Gutfeld! got 2.2 million views . No matter how skillful Stewart’s performance has been, it’s hard to avoid the sense that he’s delivering a coda to a golden age that ended long ago. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","“If you tried to reimagine your life without art ... it would look radically different,” says Karen K. Ho, a writer for ARTNews. “Art intersects with more things than people think.” It’s not just the van Goghs and Monets that hang on museum walls. It’s in works like Anish Kapoor’s innovative Cloud Gate (a.k.a. “The Bean”) in Chicago’s Millennium Park, or the spiral architecture of the Guggenheim building in New York. It’s the murals along the bike path or on the side of the school. Art adorns movie posters and storefront signage. Artists influence the clothes you wear, the music you listen to, the products you consume. Simply put, art is everywhere. If art’s such a central tenet of our culture, though, why do so many of us feel like we just don’t get it? In a YouGov survey released in 2023, nearly half of Americans said they didn’t consider themselves artistic. At 58 percent, even more respondents said they weren’t familiar with famous artistic movements or styles. For most of my life, that was me. I didn’t grow up surrounded by paintings or pottery. My elementary school art “classroom” was a windowless utility closet between the boiler and the gym that smelled like dirty socks and doubled as a tornado shelter; we met there every other day to scratch stars into linoleum and glue strips of newspaper together in an attempt at making sculptures out of papier- mâché. That limited education didn’t teach me much about art, or how to understand it. So when I arrived at the brutalist Kahler building housing Milwaukee’s lakefront art museum for the first time at 20, I had no idea what I was even looking at. I wanted to be a person who appreciated art, but to become an aficionado, I realized, I had to build a relationship with art. I not only had to take it in regularly — akin to something the writer Julia Cameron calls “artists’ dates” in her book on creativity, The Artist’s Way — but I would also need to sit with it when I did. As I began to build an art habit, visiting museums and galleries and fairs with regularity, I felt a lot like the child in the old Lynda Barry cartoon that’s been making its way around Instagram again. In the four-panel line drawing, a mother and child are standing in front of a framed sketch of another mother with a child on her lap. The childish viewer asks: “What’s sposta happen?” Look at art as an interactive adventure For a long time, I shared that sentiment, asking, “What does this even mean?” Using audio guides or listening to artists’ talks sometimes helped clarify a work’s history but it didn’t always help me connect with the art. It wasn’t until I landed in front of a Monet at Zurich’s Kunsthaus that I understood that deciphering the meaning of a work demands looking past its physicality. Looking at a painting of a Parisian pond with water lilies is only the first step to engaging with it. The strong response I had to the turn-of-the-century waterscape arose not because of its artistic qualities, but as a result of a memory it triggered — that of an art teacher who regularly insulted her students with the suggestion we would never understand the beauty of Monet. Connecting a work of art to other cultural artifacts while also relaying my own life experiences onto it follows the Surrealist belief that meaning is derived from the triangulation of the work itself, the artist’s intention, and the viewer’s response to it. Art’s meaning stems from the interaction between the viewer and the artist; what the viewer brings to the piece is important regardless of the artist’s intent. From that perspective, “getting” art should feel less intimidating, as there are no right or wrong ways of reading a piece — only ideas that can be expanded or guided by the artist. There are no right or wrong ways of reading a piece — only ideas that can be expanded “I don’t need the viewer of my paintings to know exactly what I meant, but I would like to have a handshake,” Molly Ovenden, an artist, poet, and creative coach in Duluth, Minnesota, said in an interview. “It’s more about an openness to a conversation ... or an invitation to an experience.” In that regard, considering your visit to a museum or gallery as an active, not passive, undertaking might help to solidify a relationship to art. Even in the days before mobile phones became such a central part of our lives, most of us were sparing just a short amount of time to engage with individual works. A 20-year-old study reaffirmed in 2017 revealed that on average, we only look at a work of art in a museum, including its title and accompanying information, for around 27 seconds. “There’s an effort to create work that you don’t have to spend a lot of time thinking about,” the multidisciplinary artist Gregg Deal told me. Yet he believes that critical thinking is vital to any art, on the part of both the artist and the viewer. “In school, we learn how to interact with poetry or art in a similar way that we learn to dissect frogs. We identify all of the pieces and we take them apart,” Ovenden says. In her work as a coach, she tries to get people to consider what comes after that dissection. “We don’t learn what we do once it’s all pulled apart. We kind of just move on.” It’s in the process of putting the world back together that Ovenden believes the relationship between a viewer and a work is formed. Be open to sitting with discomfort If art is a process of imagination that makes “reality conceivable, memorable, sometimes even predictable,” as culture philosopher Susanne K. Langer writes , such engagement can go even further, as it gives rise to feelings we aren’t in touch with every day, like disgust and awe. In viewing Deal’s works, I experienced that firsthand. Several of his pieces inspire humor as they remix Western cowboy tropes, while others depicting the Indigenous experience give rise to feelings of shame because the humanity portrayed reveals a disturbing truth about American conquest. “How do you teach a willingness to be uncomfortable?” “I’m not trying to make work and think that people are going to like it,” Deal told me, noting that his role as an artist is to convey his ideas with honesty. And truthful art can make people wildly uncomfortable. “But that discomfort is such an important part of the work,” Deal says. In this case, part of not getting the art could stem from a reluctance to confront that discomfort. As Langer writes, teaching art is an education in feeling; when art gives rise to emotions that we do not always have access to, it can feel too tough to manage. Yet it is in grappling with those emotions that the connection to art — and, ultimately, understanding it — is forged. “How do you teach a willingness to be uncomfortable?” asks Ovenden. Even as an avid lover of art, she finds the emotional response doesn’t always come easy. “It can be really overwhelming.” Perhaps that overwhelm is a positive sign, as it reveals an authenticity that we don’t confront in much of our daily lives. Keep an eye out for glimmers of your own experience In an interview with the Paris Review , the cartoonist Barry said that she saw the way we relate to art as proof of catharsis. “That’s what the arts do. In the course of human life we have a million phantom-limb pains — losing a parent when you’re little, being in a war, even something as dumb as having a mean teacher — and seeing it somehow reflected, whether it’s in our own work or listening to a song, is a way to deal with it.” That relatability could also serve to explain why Barry’s cartoon has remained so popular after being in circulation for years: it depicts the process of revelation the art onlooker experiences. After the mother lifts her child up to view the artwork more closely, they cuddle in a move that mirrors the model in the painting. Mom sees herself reflected in the painting and — epiphany! It’s a meta response to seeing ourselves in a cartoon depicting us seeing ourselves. Or, as Karen K. Ho told me, if you start to think about the arts as a way of transforming time or transforming your experience — if you move beyond the surface response of “this is a nice picture” or “this is a picture that sucks” — then looking at art can be a really interesting endeavor. She refers to the Vermeer exhibition at Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum in 2023 , a show that sold out almost immediately and drew visitors from around the world. While you might believe that your life bears little relevance to that of 17th-century Dutch aristocrats, she says that in portraying the beauty of everyday moments, Vermeer inspires you to look at your life anew. “Hopefully when you think about doing those things, you understand there can be beauty in that moment, too.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","F inally. The seriously out-of-control far-leftist Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron, he who has taken upon his Trump-hating self to fine the former president for $355 million for supposedly inflating his net worth, is finally getting some comeuppance. The New York Post front-paged the news: Trump-supporting truckers vow their boycott could ‘shut New York City down’ after $355M fraud ruling The Post reports: Truckers supporting Donald Trump are warning that their refusal to deliver to the Big Apple could paralyze New York City — as more drivers vow to join the boycott following the bombshell ruling in the former president’s civil fraud case. “It could shut New York City down,” said Jennifer Hernandez, a trucker who has joined in the protest against Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron’s decision to fine Trump $355 million for inflating his net worth by billions to dupe banks and insurers. “I’m not trying to hurt the people of New York, that’s not what I’m trying to do,” Hernandez insisted on NewsNation Monday morning. “But if New York loses just 10% of the trucks that go in there, their prices are going to skyrocket on everything — from milk to eggs, to any type of goods that the consumer needs. When that happens, it’s going to cost everyone more money,” she warned. Well, exactly. What’s of serious significance here is that finally the out-of-control authoritarian and decidedly corrupt New York legal establishment is being taken on — in this instance, by truckers. One question that comes out of this is: Just why did it take truckers to take on these people? Which is to say: Where is the New York Bar? Whether it’s Judge Engoron or New York Attorney General Letitia James — the latter openly campaigning on a vow to use her office to get Trump — the corruption each have brought to the New York legal system is vividly self-evident. Along with the truckers, New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik has also stepped up to the plate. As reported over at ABC News , Stefanik has sent a letter to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct, saying this of Engoron: Judge Engoron’s bizarre and biased behavior is making New York’s judicial system a laughingstock.…Simply put, Judge Engoron has displayed a clear judicial bias against the defendant throughout the case, breaking several rules in the New York Code of Judicial Conduct. Similarly, Stefanik has filed a complaint against James, the New York attorney general. Writes Stefanik, per NBC : Stefanik, R-N.Y., alleges that James is “conducting a biased investigation and prosecution” of Trump and “attacking” him through “extrajudicial statements,” her letter to the New York Committee on Professional Standards says. She also argues that James made “highly inappropriate and prejudicial comments on social media” and asks that the Attorney Grievance Committee investigate James and issue consequences, such as disbarring or suspending her. Bingo. Now come the truckers, who are turning to economic action in taking on the corrupt Engoron. In its own way, the truckers’ action is symbolic of the general revolt by millions of Americans against a political establishment that they see as decidedly corrupt. It is that belief that has so vividly animated the Trump movement, well on display at the former president’s decidedly energized rallies filled with enthusiastic thousands. So, as the former president once said, stand back and stand by. It seems to be forgotten that the heart of commercial New York City is Manhattan — a literal island. If truckers refuse to transport the most basic of goods into Manhattan, there will be serious economic problems. As mentioned, prices in the city will skyrocket. And in the larger sense, there is a decided lesson here for those paying attention. Which is to say, Americans have awakened to the reality that their once-honored legal and political establishments — here personified by Judge Engoron and Attorney General James — have been corrupted. And they will be looking closely at those unwilling to call out the corruption — and do something about it. The truckers are standing up for America. And, for that, they should be congratulated."
"1","W e spoke to Roger Kaplan, the regular American Spectator tennis correspondent, on the subject of Presidents Day, who admitted to feeling peeved by the lack of response from the White House to the offer from his organization, the East Side Athletic and Social Club, to give the First Couple some much needed PT on the tennis courts, with special attention to foot work, at a special sale price of only $225 per hour. His remarks (edited): It is Feb. 19, 2024, Adar I 10, 5784, and two questions occur to me that shouldn’t to someone my age: Why is “Presidents Day” celebrated with paid leave for federal workers and all manner of others who pattern their terms of employment on the feds’, spreading sloth and incompetence? And why are there two months of Adar? I can see the value of honoring George Washington’s birthday or marking the date of his passing with respectful remembrance, or Abraham Lincoln’s, or in fact any other’s — different states and localities even might want to decide which ones to observe — why not? — but an abstract “Presidents Day” is empty, even sinful — a kind of idolatry. Stronger cases can be made for Memorial Day and Veterans Day, for they underscore the debt all Americans owe to the veterans who fought in all the wars that preserved our country. We are saddened by the lives lost but strive the rationalize the bitter necessity or understand the shoddy policies that brought them about in the hope of preventing others. And yet, even here, I think it is far more meaningful — and emotional — to remember specific wars and specific veterans. We mark Nov. 11, Armistice Day, to remember the horror and meaning — if we can ever find it — of World War I. We mark Pearl Harbor Day and the V Days ending World War II in Europe and Asia to ponder the enormity of that fight. Being specific is always good advice. The perverse effect of these abstract holidays is not that they turn into “gimme” frenzies, with commercial establishments using the occasion to promote sales. Actually, there is nothing wrong with hucksterism, and we should not denigrate the commercial reflex in a land that was founded by commercial men and owes its greatness in so many fields, from space exploration to medical breakthroughs to great music and writing, to the culture of business, aka the spirit of enterprise, and the work ethic. You cannot blame a store owner for luring idlers into his shop; on the contrary, if they are idling instead of working, whose fault is it? It is the fault of the wannabe tyrants downtown (I’m writing from Washington) who grab every opportunity to buy votes for their awful policies. Unpaid leaves are ways to buy off, or at least demoralize, the people, but they are borrowing against their children and grandchildren. The other question is why there are two months called Adar, but I can ask a rabbi, or better, my friends on Long Island, who unlike me were yeshiva bochers in the day. However, the short answer is simple: the additional month occurs when there is a leap; in other words, it is a holy (and practical, the two go together) way to recognize the greatness of creation, which made the solar system such that there are leap years. Adar is a time of rejoicing, so it’s good to have two from time to time. It is the time of Purim — more on that from our resident sages as we get nearer, but basically it is another time to remember God’s rescue of the Jewish people, something quite germane these days, and as such a time for an extra drink. Just by way of short preview, the bad guy was a greedy and power mad scoundrel called Haman, who wanted to wipe out the Jews because they preached and tried to practice virtue as defined by the Higher Power, which went against his own preferences. But the king whom this sociopath was supposed to serve but against whom he plotted was, to use an anachronism, something of a philosemite since he was in love with a Jewish princess, Esther, crazy love at first sight like — I am not trying to be silly — Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Purim, in other words, is specific, as is the next holiday, Passover. Purim and Passover are not “deliverance days” (as in “Presidents Day”); they are there to remember specific people and events. And as for us, today, Americans in America, we must stop the futile effort to get to Nowheresville while obsessing over old rich guys running for president, consumed by their own distasteful vanity, nothing there but suits overstuffed with bile and mouths full of feet. We should be talking about young(er) guys — or even dolls — willing to serve the Republic and worthy of the voters’ gamble. We need specific names. It is not too late. On the contrary, it’s a long time to November. I say draft a few good men and women to make competitive teams, draw the starting line, and get a real, honest, exciting, patriotic race going, a race for America, and totally ignore the others. It will work. (And, yes, my vote will be influenced — not bought! — by an honest offer, such as managing the White House tennis court.)"
"1","M r. Biden, are you in favor of Hamas remaining a political and military force in Gaza? You know that they have stated publicly that they will continue to plan and carry out attacks like Oct. 7 as long as it takes. You know that they do not believe in a two-state solution. You know that wherever they are victorious and wherever they are in control, no Jew is left alive unless he or she is a hostage. Mr. Biden, are you in favor of rearming Hamas? Are you in favor of supplying their fighters and commanders with the food and material that enables them to fight another day? Are you in favor of their receiving what they need to rebuild their 250-mile system of military tunnels? Are you in favor of them deciding how the aid you give is distributed? Mr. Biden, surely you know how deeply the UNRWA has aided Hamas in establishing a culture of hate for generations of Arab youth? How complicit it is in Hamas’ war? How it has shielded Hamas command centers with its buildings, how its schools not only indoctrinate in hate but shield weapons and ammunition stores and serve over decades as rocket launching sites for indiscriminate bombardment of Israeli towns and cities? Mr. Biden, you know that Hamas is sponsored by Iran and bankrolled by Iran (as well as by the dupes or stooges of the EU and NGOs and your own State Department). You know that whether you recognize it or not, Iran is at war with the US and with Israel. You know that if you respond predictably with severe force to any warlike action, making them pay a penalty they cannot afford, they will stop. You know that temporizing and pretending has allowed Iran to come to the brink of employing nuclear weapons. You know that delaying establishing credible deterrence until they are fully nuclear armed will be make nuclear devastation more likely than at any time since the Cold War began. Why then, Mr. Biden, do you dither? Is it because you believe that crossing the violently antisemitic extreme-left wing of your party will hurt your chances for reelection? That would mean you put yourself before your country and before your obligations before God. Is it because you are too proud of your role as a founder of the pro-Iran policy instituted stealthily by Obama? Then lie about that, as you lie about the border policy, and pretend you always have been sane about Iran’s criminal intentions. Why do you hesitate? Is it because you can hide behind the successfully maintained front of likability in which you are so practiced? Surely in matters of life and death, appearances should not rule, only substance. You are capable, in the supreme crisis, to grasp the substance? Or are you, God forbid, so mentally incompetent that you can no longer fulfill your duties to America? (May we please not be delivered into the hands of Ms. Harris!) Your initial response to Oct. 7, Mr. President, was beyond anything I imagined. But you are fast beating a horrific change of course that can lead only to disaster. For all of our sakes, for God’s sake, Mr. President, act the man. I sincerely doubt that you are a regular reader of The American Spectator (though I’d gladly sport you to a subscription, if you’d like). But the connection between leaders and their people, for the good and for the ill, is a fact. For those of you who do read this, your asking the questions yourself help to clarify the smog and the stench of those murderous noxious ideologies that Biden has for too long flirted with, not taken seriously, and, through weakness, encouraged and emboldened. Help purify the air, dear readers. Your focus on the eternal truths that guide our course and on the emergent facts of the wars being fought against us help define who America is going to be. The front lines of the struggle run through our hearts and souls."
"1","Just in time for Presidents Day, the American Political Science Association released its 2024 survey of presidential greatness, which merely confirms the ideological and political bias of political science professionals — the very same people who teach (indoctrinate?) our children at colleges and universities throughout the United States. A survey like this should make parents think twice about whether to pay the exorbitant tuition to have political science professors miseducate their children. Some of the rankings are by now standard — George Washington (3 rd ), Franklin D. Roosevelt (2 nd ), and Abraham Lincoln (1 st ) at or near the top; Harry Truman (6 th ) and Theodore Roosevelt (4 th ) in the top 10; Calvin Coolidge and Richard Nixon near the bottom (34 th and 35 th , respectively); James Buchanan (44 th ) at or near the bottom; and Donald Trump (45 th ), of course, dead last. Some of the rankings are simply ludicrous and laughable. These political science “experts” rank Barack Obama (7 th ) ahead of Dwight Eisenhower (8 th ) and Ronald Reagan (16 th ); they rank Lyndon Johnson (9 th ), John Kennedy (10 th ), Bill Clinton (12 th ), Joe Biden (14 th ), and Woodrow Wilson (15 th ) higher than Reagan (16 th ) and Andrew Jackson (21 st ). (Jackson’s ranking continues to trend downward perhaps because he manifested a populism that reminds the professors of Trump). When asked which president should join Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt on Mount Rushmore, most said FDR, followed by Obama, then Eisenhower, Madison, and Kennedy. The participants ranked Trump the most polarizing president, followed by Andrew Jackson, Obama, Reagan, Nixon, and George W. Bush, even though we fought a polarizing civil war in which more than 700,000 soldiers lost their lives during Lincoln’s presidency. Indeed, these geniuses ranked Lincoln as the fourth least polarizing president. Here again, ideology trumps history. The survey participants selected Jimmy Carter as the most underrated president, Kennedy (surprisingly) as the most over-rated president, followed closely by Reagan (no surprise there). Reagan’s victory in the Cold War, no doubt, is overrated because it is likely that most of these professors give the lion’s share of the credit to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The survey, of course, fits within and confirms the media narrative that favors liberal presidents over conservative presidents, and that favors Biden over Trump as the 2024 presidential election season heats up. The Hill’s headline states, “Presidential experts rank Biden 14 th among presidents in survey, Trump comes in last.” The New York Times ’ headline similarly states , “Poll Ranks Biden as 14th-Best President, With Trump Last.” Newsweek’s headline says , “Donald Trump Places Last in New ‘Presidential Greatness’ Rankings.” The Los Angeles Times features this tease on Google: “Experts rank Biden among the best presidents. Trump? Not so much.” This is how an ideologically biased survey of so-called experts becomes a “news story” to the benefit of Biden as the 2024 election approaches. The greater long-term harm of ideologically driven political science professors is the influence they have on the minds and worldviews of young voters. Polls in the 2020 election showed that student voters favored Biden over Trump by a margin of 70 percent to 18 percent. After the election, the Hill reported that 61 percent of students voted for Biden. In a recent Economist/YouGov poll, Biden led Trump among all voters under age 30 by 53 percent to 24 percent . ABC News reported last October that voters under age 30 “are trending left of the general electorate.” This should surprise no one if what those students read and hear in their political science classes echoes the beliefs of their professors as manifested in the presidential greatness survey. The miseducation of our students, of course, occurs not just in colleges and universities but in our elementary, middle, and high schools too. But at the university level, ideology plays a greater role. And the mainstream media simply reaffirms what the students learn from their professors: FDR great, Coolidge bad; Truman and Kennedy great, Nixon bad; Obama great, Reagan bad; Biden good, Trump bad. This miseducation, of course, extends beyond presidential greatness to subjects like Watergate, McCarthyism, communism, the Korean and Vietnam wars, the Great Society, civil rights, the end of the Cold War, and other sources of liberal conventional wisdom. As long as the Left controls the education establishment in this country, the rankings of presidents will continue to be heavily skewed in favor of liberals and Democrats, and the miseducation of our students will continue. Think about that the next time the tuition bill comes due."
"1","Capitalism has proven itself to be an extraordinary engine for creating wealth and improving standards of living, as well as promoting the rule of law, representative government, and more free and open societies, in general. In fact, capitalism is unique among economic systems in these accomplishments. Indeed, the history of non-capitalist countries is largely one of brutal poverty and political oppression. Yet today in the United States — the ultimate example of the capitalist free-enterprise system — among our youth, capitalism is increasingly disdained in favor of various forms of collectivism, due, primarily, to the notion promoted by the political Left that capitalism is the enemy of “social justice.” Of course, the term “social justice” is used in a lot of different, and often perverse, ways. But if we stick to the actual meaning of “justice,” we have to come to the conclusion that there is no bigger ally in the quest for actual “social justice” than capitalism. Capitalism was born out of the Enlightenment idea that freeing people to pursue their own economic interests, instead of being directed by a monarch, feudal lord, or some other outside power, was both moral and efficacious. When people are allowed to use their talents and energies in the ways they deem best for themselves, not only are they far more productive and innovative, but also, as Adam Smith put it, they are led, as if by an invisible hand, to promote the public good. The reason for that is the simple basis of capitalism itself. The foundation stones of capitalism are freedom and law. Capitalism is rooted in the idea of freedom of choice and voluntary exchange (markets). Therefore, in order to prosper under capitalism, one must produce what others desire. This is in contrast to systems like socialism or communism, which are command economies where people must produce and consume as the governing authority directs. Further, capitalism requires the recognition of property rights. This recognition in turn demands respect for the rule of law. Again, socialism and communism are based on the negation of individual property rights and on the belief that the government can and should take anything from anybody as it determines will serve the “common good.” Predictably, it was in England that the Industrial Revolution first burst out, fertilized by the new ideas of capitalism and what the historian Thomas Macaulay described as “ordered liberty.” The old 17 th- century European powers of Spain and Portugal, not understanding the process of wealth creation , and still mired in ideas of government control and mercantilism, were, by the middle of the 19 th century, overshadowed by the early adopters of capitalism, the Netherlands, the United States, and Great Britain. Likewise, China, arguably the most advanced nation on Earth in 1700, was comparatively backward by 1840. It should also come as no surprise that an economic system based on freedom would progress hand-in-hand with an evolution toward more representative government — as we witnessed in Great Britain (and in its American colonies), where these new Enlightenment ideas were first to take root — whereas the societies that adopted socialism or communism (or had them imposed upon them) quickly developed into barbarous tyrannical regimes, such as the Soviet Union and its eastern European satellites, mainland China, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela. As capitalism encourages individual liberty in the economic sphere, it is also compatible with, and supportive of, individual liberty in other spheres of human existence, including representative government. Communism, socialism, and other forms of collectivism, on the other hand, provide a theoretical underpinning for the justification of authoritarianism and dictatorship. “Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,” wrote Lord Acton. And it is no coincidence that every country that has adopted communism or some other system based on strict government economic control has not become a shining example of “social justice” but has instead turned out like George Orwell’s Animal Farm . The “Equity” Trap The critics of capitalism often equate “social justice” with “equity.” Since capitalism does not produce “equity” — that is, approximately equal outcomes across individuals or certain identified groups — it is antagonistic to “social justice.” Capitalism does not produce this definition of “equity” because capitalism is based on freedom. (But, as Thomas Sowell has noted, no society has actually ever produced such “equity” — including communist ones.) Most ethnic groups, as well as the sexes, differ in many ways (including average age and education levels), act in different ways, and often want different things. Therefore, in a free society and in a free economy, there will always be inequality of economic outcomes. Most capitalist nations have chosen to use the wealth created through capitalism to help those at the lower end of the economic scale by instituting various degrees of welfarism, but any serious attempt to obliterate economic inequality must result in a strangling not only of innovation and wealth creation but also of freedom. In order to achieve economic equality among large groups that invariably have differing characteristics, some overriding power must inflict individual injustices, either to provide some individuals benefits they did not earn or to deny them to others who earned them. How can the term “social justice” be applied to a society in which the majority of individuals are being subjected to some form of injustice? The goal of a just society, and a just economic system, is to allow for individuals to be treated fairly, to be rewarded as markets (imperfect as they might be), instead of as government overseers (as imperfect, biased, and corruptible as they inevitably are), dictate. Individual justice is social justice, and individual justice is best served through capitalism. Though capitalism provides the advantage of dispersing power with the “impersonal” forces of markets determining many important things, like prices, it does so without removing personal accountability in decision making (though that can happen in larger companies). Owners of smaller capitalist business always, and managers in larger capitalist companies often, are directly impacted by decisions on hiring and firing employees. Their income and positions are dependent upon hiring and retaining the best people. As such, petty and irrational biases are penalized, and thereby discouraged, under capitalism. Anyone familiar with the workings of government bureaucracies, on the other hand, know that government managers can engage in petty and irrational biases all they want without fear that it will endanger their income or job. Removing accountability is not a recipe for increasing “justice.” Capitalism, like mankind, is not perfect. But its imperfections can be mitigated by modest regulation and are limited in scope, since it is a system based on diffused power. Bad individuals can do bad things to others under capitalism (just as they can in all other systems), but their power is limited and ultimately runs against the rule of law that capitalist society demands. On the other hand, under systems where the power of a select few over the many is necessarily near limitless in order to control economic activity and engender “equity,” the imperfections of those select few invariably have catastrophic consequences because such systems allow those faults to be expressed with near unlimited power. Capitalism is not a panacea that can cure all of society’s ailments, but it does provide a strong bulwark against the collectivist ideologies that caused such great misery to much of the world’s population in the 20 th century and continues to cause so much misery today. Will we learn from this history, or, in our quest for greater “social justice,” will we throw away the enviable justice we have and replace it with the grinding injustice of capitalism’s competitors?

"1","I’ll say this upfront: I think it’s most likely that Vladimir Putin, or elements of his regime, had Russian dissident Alexei Navalny killed. Putin is certainly capable of bumping off the political opposition — and with Navalny directly under Putin’s thumb, having been thrown in prison and then dropping dead suddenly at 47 years old, when he’d already been poisoned once with the chemical nerve agent Novichok, and then his body being withheld from his family — it’s hard to look any guiltier than Putin and his people do. Navalny was caught on film conspiring with Western intelligence agencies attempting to unseat Putin. From our perspective, that might make him a hero. From Putin’s, he was a domestic enemy. We don’t have to leave aside our disgust at what happened to Navalny to note that in the Russian way, what happened to him makes an ugly kind of sense. That’s how they roll in Russia. I also think that Navalny’s death plays — though I would imagine there were lots of reasons closer to home why Navalny would be killed by the Putin regime — as a profound boot to the testicles of Tucker Carlson. Carlson, after all, had barely left Moscow after interviewing Putin, making the statement and following up with video to the effect that the Russian capital is a nicer and better-run place than most major American cities, and then he was immediately humiliated by Navalny’s death. Kurt Schlichter, writing at Townhall on Monday , was spot on in noting that Carlson’s basic point was that those cities are horrifically run, and whether Carlson is correct in comparing Moscow to New York isn’t the point. New York isn’t run as well as it should be, and the people who run New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, St. Louis, Detroit, New Orleans, and pretty much all of the big blue shitty cities don’t care about running them well. What they care about is power and graft — and running a city into the ground, chasing away its tax base, and replacing it with federal swag that carries zero accountability, is a pristine way to achieve both. Power and graft have replaced the dollar as the going currency among America’s ruling elite, and that’s a damn shame, because power and graft are the currencies of totalitarian, kleptocratic, and lawless regimes — something ours is rapidly descending into. The examples are legion, but one that just showed up in Washington state has offered a clear view of just how ridiculous things have become: It could be a lot harder to find affordable and durable car tires under a bill being considered in the current legislative session. The bill would give the Washington State Department of Commerce the authority to ban tires it deems inefficient and bad for the climate. It would apply to any replacement tires for cars and light-duty trucks under 10,000 pounds. It would also give the Department of Commerce the ability to fine people anywhere from $100 to $10,000 for violations. “At the end of the day, we’re facing a climate crisis, and we need to use as many possible tools to get ourselves out of that,” Democrat Representative Chipalo Street told the House Transportation Committee. “This is one way to increase the gas efficiency of some of our vehicles.” There is zero evidence by anything remotely close to a credible source to indicate that “inefficient” tires play a measurable role in predicting the weather over the next century. The stated justification for that bill is nothing short of gibberish. But that’s not what’s really going on — what’s really happening is that the radical leftists at the Washington state Department of Commerce would, thanks to this bill if it were to pass, have the ability to make supplicants out of tire suppliers and vendors in that state, something they will monetize to the hilt both above and below the table. That might be a bit more subtle than using nerve agents on the political prisoners, but when it comes to power and graft, the general societal outcome isn’t all that different. And besides, using tires as a stealth means of practicing petty tyranny on the citizens is about as subtle as it gets from the modern Democrat Party; the American state, which is supposed to be our financial capital, has just used its judiciary to effect a bill of attainder on one of its most prominent former citizens for “fraud” that contained no victim and no harm. And the people defending this utter outrage are some of the stupidest humans on the planet. To wit: Trump said his fraud had no victims. Wasn’t the taxman cheated when he devalued his property for that purpose? Weren’t banks cheated when he negotiated more favorable rates based on fabricated numbers? What am I missing here? — Being J Wood (@BeingJWood) February 17, 2024 And by the way, today’s Democrat Party is no stranger to killing its political prisoners — or have you not noticed the rash of suicides among the inmates of the Jan. 6 gulags? — or even taking them. Just ask Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, or Donald Trump. Or Mark Houck . Or Douglass Mackey , who got seven months for making memes in a travesty of justice that wouldn’t have been believed 15 years ago. Then there’s the story of Gonzalo Lira , the American journalist who died in a Ukrainian prison for doing his job with zero meaningful assistance from the Biden administration to get him out. Schlichter called Carlson an American patriot for demanding better of his government, and Schlichter is correct. Did Putin lie to Carlson? Absolutely. If nothing else, he told a lie of omission when he recited 30 minutes of Russo-Ukrainian history and never once mentioned the Holodomor. Carlson might not have felt comfortable arguing the subject with someone who lives and breathes it, and that’s understandable. But the effect was not good. On the other hand, is Carlson’s softer-than-optimal treatment of Putin really any worse than this? How utterly pathetic. Anyone who has paid attention to the controversy in question knows that the House Republican position on aid to Ukraine has never been “no.” It has been that such aid cannot be unconditional; it has to be accompanied by a strategic plan, if not an exit strategy, and it must come in concert with a commitment to stop the flood of unvetted migrants across our borders. This is by no means an unreasonable position, particularly when there is an actual invasion of America by tens of thousands of single, military-age Chinese men whose intentions here are utterly and completely unqualified in any way: A large amount of the illegal crossings in San Diego sector happen in Jacumba where there is a small gap in the wall that illegal immigrants pour through every day. (We shot this a couple weeks ago). Inexplicably, the Biden admin has made no effort to fill or fix this small gap. pic.twitter.com/wqQRI917VU — Bill Melugin (@BillMelugin_) February 13, 2024 You are not negotiating in good faith when you openly allow China to invade America while demanding $60 billion to stop Russia from invading Ukraine, which isn’t even part of NATO. And when the regime media frames questions to the decrepit figurehead atop the government in a way that blames Mike Johnson for Alexei Navalny’s death, we’re down a rabbit hole beyond anything we could have thought possible 15 years ago. Last week when Navalny died, there was a rash of the most disgusting social media attacks on Johnson that I’ve ever seen: MAKE IT TREND: #MoscowMikeJohnson is a traitor to America & Democracy. #MoscowMike https://t.co/OpnV7D6cc5 pic.twitter.com/5eO9rnyXUK — Metal Gear Fella 🇵🇱🇺🇦🇩🇪🇺🇸🇪🇺 (@BonkGearMetal) February 16, 2024 Ukrainian troops withdraw from Avdiivka, Donetsk region because of ammunition shortages.

His death horrifies everybody who values human life, but the truth of the matter is that Navalny’s fate has nothing to do with Ukraine. The only real connection is that Team Biden and the mouth-breathing social media and legacy corporate media goons who can’t wait to shovel our money into the meat grinder in southeast Europe, from which more power and graft comes more easily than anywhere else on earth, have found Navalny a convenient poster child. Especially in death. Want a theory about Navalny? I’ll give you one. Perhaps Putin decided now was a good time to kill Navalny because he knows he’s going to win in Ukraine regardless of the $60 billion. Perhaps he knows that prolonging the war in Ukraine will further expose the rot that infects our defense industry and its manufacturing capabilities. Perhaps he knows that what ails Ukraine isn’t a lack of weapons and ammunition — a problem that long precedes the need for that $60 billion, by the way, and Joe Biden and his team spent months spinning lies about how the Ukrainians were going to retake the Donbas and Crimea in their “spring offensive” when that time could have been spent at the peace table salvaging something — but a lack of manpower. They’ve been worn down by a bigger, stronger, more populous, and better organized nation, and a huge portion of the Ukrainian people have demonstrated their level of faith in the Zelensky government by bugging out for other countries. It turns out that Victoria Nuland’s brand of “our democracy” doesn’t inspire all that much loyalty among people who have deserved better treatment from politicians inside and outside their country. And if that’s true, then the new narrative of Ukrainian desperation at the hands of “Moscow Mike” is a double lie. Hell, it might be a quadruple or quintuple lie, depending on how far down the rabbit hole you’re willing to go. I’ve had enough of these lies. I think Vladimir Putin is a dirty son of a bitch who will burn in hell someday, and I earnestly hope that some semblance of Ukrainian sovereignty can be preserved. But I think Joe Biden should be held to a higher standard than Putin, because while I can’t think of a Russian ruler — other than maybe Boris Yeltsin — who wasn’t a dirty son of a bitch who deserved to burn in hell, an American president exists to further the interests of our people and to uphold our Constitution. And Joe Biden never once in his miserable life — from the time he voted against the Alaska pipeline in the middle of the 1973 Arab oil embargo to his current attacks on Mike Johnson and Donald Trump amid a special counsel’s report showing that he’s committed multiple felonies for which he’s not worth charging because he lacks the mental faculties to stand trial — has given a tinker’s damn about those responsibilities. As president or in any of the other offices he holds. Putin is a stone-cold killer and a master practitioner of the game of power and graft. He’s hardly pretended to be anything else, and he’s the president of a country in which there are no expectations that politicians would ever pursue anything else. And yet Joe Biden shows zero ability, or even desire, to rise above that standard in a country that, at least historically, demands a whole lot more. Putin isn’t my problem. Joe Biden is. And so are those mindless, empty-souled spawns of the modern Obamunist Democrat Party who enable and amplify him. Last week Jonathan Martin, while conceding at Politico that Biden is a rotting piece of political meat but journosplaining to ignorant Republicans that he isn’t going anywhere, actually attempted to call Biden a “decent” man. Decent? The decline in our politics, our rule of law, our economic capabilities, and our national prestige and credibility — or even our national sovereignty — on this man’s watch is more pronounced than it has been at any time since our founding. And as scandalous as Alexei Navalny’s killing surely is, what Joe Biden and the rest of the cabal behind him is inflicting on our people is a far more horrific and much more actionable outrage."
"2","At the end of November, Israeli reporter Yuval Abraham broke one of the most important stories of the war in Gaza to date — an inside look at the disturbing reasoning that has led the Israeli military to kill so many civilians. Citing conversations with “seven current and former members of Israel’s intelligence community,” Abraham reported that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had changed its doctrine to permit far greater civilian casualties than it would have tolerated in previous wars. IDF leadership was greenlighting strikes on civilian targets like apartment buildings and public infrastructure that they knew would kill scores of innocent Gazans. “In one case,” Abraham reported, “the Israeli military command knowingly approved the killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in an attempt to assassinate a single top Hamas military commander.” Abraham’s reporting showed, in granular detail, the ways that this war would not be like others: that Israel, so grievously wounded by Hamas on October 7, would go to extraordinarily violent lengths to destroy the group responsible for that day’s atrocities. In doing so, it would commit atrocities of its own. At least 28,000 Palestinians are already confirmed dead, with more likely lying in the rubble. Around 70 percent of Gaza’s homes have been damaged or destroyed; at least 85 percent of Gaza’s population has been displaced . The indirect death toll from starvation and disease will likely be higher. One academic estimate suggested that nearly 500,000 Palestinians will die within a year unless the war is brought to a halt, reflecting both the physical damage to Gaza’s infrastructure and the consequences of Israel’s decision to besiege Gaza on day three of the war. (While the siege has been relaxed somewhat, limitations on aid flow remain strict .)

Said Khatib/AFP via Getty Images The Israeli government describes civilian death as a regrettable but inevitable consequence of waging a war to eliminate Hamas. But as of right now, that goal is still very far away — and may ultimately prove to be impossible. There’s no doubt that the IDF has done significant damage to Hamas's infrastructure. Israel has killed or captured somewhere around one-third of Hamas’s fighting force , destroyed at least half of its rocket stockpile , and demolished somewhere between 20 and 40 percent of its tunnel network under Gaza . The more the war goes on, the higher those numbers will become. But as significant as these achievements are, “none of them come close to eliminating Hamas,” says Dan Byman , a professor at Georgetown who studies Israeli counterterrorism policy. The group, he explains, has “very deep roots in Gaza” — ones that could only be permanently removed if Israel had a good plan for a postwar political arrangement in Gaza. Yet at present, Israel still has no plan at all . With support for Hamas rising in reaction to Israeli brutality, Israel runs a real risk of actually strengthening the terrorist group’s political position in the long run. A world where hundreds of thousands of Gazans suffer and only Hamas benefits is the worst of all possible worlds. Yet it is increasingly looking like a likely one. How did we get here? The truth is that this nightmare was depressingly predictable. When I surveyed over a dozen experts about the war back in October , they warned that Israel had a dangerously loose understanding of what the war was about. The stated aim of “destroying Hamas” was at once maximalist and open-ended: It wasn’t clear how it could be accomplished or what limit there might be on the means used in its pursuit. Israel’s conduct in the war so far has vindicated these fears. The embrace of an objective at once so massive and vague has dragged Israel down the moral nadir documented in Abraham’s reporting, with unclear and perhaps even self-defeating ends. It is a situation that Matt Duss , the executive vice president at the Center for International Policy, terms “an era-defining catastrophe.” Things did not have to be this way. After the horrific events of October 7, Israel had an obviously just claim to wage a defensive war against Hamas — and the tactical and strategic capabilities to execute a smarter, more limited, and more humane war plan . The blame for this failure lies with Israel’s terrible wartime leadership: an extremist government headed by Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu , a venal prime minister currently on trial for corruption who has placed his personal interests over his country’s even during wartime. “You couldn’t have had a worse government to respond to a worse moment,” says Dov Waxman , the director of UCLA’s Center for Israel Studies. “People like to separate the war from the government that’s running it, but I think you can’t.” It’s not too late for Israel to try something different. While Netanyahu won’t change course voluntarily, both Israeli voters and the Biden administration have significant leverage over their policies. Their combined pressure might produce either a change in policy or a change in government, pulling Israel away from the abyss. And in the longer run, a postwar Israel might begin reckoning with the deeply mistaken assumptions behind its terrible policy — and, in doing so, transform the future of the Israel-Palestine conflict . The inevitability of atrocity Michael Walzer is the world’s greatest living military ethicist. His 1977 book Just and Unjust Wars is the seminal modern text in what’s called “just war theory,” the branch of political philosophy dedicated to examining when and how war can be waged ethically. Whether one agrees with it or not, his work is the baseline by which all other work in the field is judged and has influenced law and policy around the world. On the American left, Walzer is also known as one of Israel’s most famous defenders. In a 2017 essay , he describes Just and Unjust Wars as the outgrowth of his attempt to reconcile his opposition to the Vietnam War with his support for Israel’s 1967 war against its Arab neighbors. After October 7, he has repeatedly defended Israel’s right to defend itself and put the majority of the moral blame for human suffering on Hamas. “Israel’s military response to the atrocities of October 7th is a just and necessary war,” he wrote in December . Yet when we spoke in early February, Walzer was far more critical of Israel’s war effort than I expected. “Israel has created new conditions on the ground [that] made it virtually impossible to continue the war” ethically, he told me. “I am hoping for a kind of ceasefire.” Walzer is referring to the geography of the fighting. When Israel began its ground offensive in Gaza, it concentrated the fighting in the northern Gaza Strip — instructing Palestinian civilians to flee to the south to stay out of harm’s way. But today, Israel is threatening a major ground offensive in the southern city of Rafah, where huge numbers of Palestinian civilians have fled with nowhere else to go. For Walzer, Israel cannot wage war justly when Gazan civilians truly cannot escape. Palestinians inspect the damage to residential buildings in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, on February 12, 2024. Fatima Shbair/AP Photo But Walzer also pointed to a deeper moral problem with Israel’s seemingly impossible objective of destroying Hamas. Generally, just war theorists believe that war cannot be ethically waged without having “reasonable prospects for success.” The logic is intuitive: War inevitably involves a lot of killing, and killing can only be justified if it accomplishes a greater good. If the objective behind the killing is impossible (or extremely implausible), then there is no greater good to be won from the bloodshed. Walzer believes that many Israelis, traumatized by the events of October 7, did not fully appreciate how intermingled Hamas — the de facto government of Gaza — was with Gazan society. It’s an organization made up of not only tens of thousands of fighters, but also many civilian functionaries and a vast physical infrastructure. Truly destroying such an entity cannot reasonably be accomplished through force of arms alone — at least not without a yearslong military campaign and an unthinkable amount of civilian death. Some Israelis are beginning to acknowledge this reality. In January, Gadi Eisenkot — a senior minister in Israel’s wartime Cabinet — declared that “whoever speaks of absolute defeat [of Hamas] is not speaking the truth,” and that Israeli hostages in Gaza could only be brought home as part of a ceasefire deal. A classified Israeli military intelligence assessment , reported by Israel’s Channel 12 news station, predicts that Hamas will persist as a terrorist organization even if Israel destroys much of its more conventional military capabilities. “It was when they grasped the extent of the embeddedness and the tunnel city that they realized that was not a possible goal and therefore not a just goal,” Walzer says, speaking of his contacts in Israel. “The goal as stated on October 8 wasn’t wrong because we [outside Gaza] were so ignorant of what Hamas had become.” Walzer may be judging Israel’s leadership a bit too leniently. Hamas’s deep entrenchment in Gaza was well-known prior to the war and was part of the reason previous Israeli governments had opted not to destroy the militant group. But Walzer is correct that the nature of the objective shapes the war’s morality — even down to the kinds of tactics Israel was willing to employ. In previous wars with Hamas, Israel’s primary objective had been degrading Hamas’s military capabilities and deterring it from attacking Israel in the near future. These are relatively limited aims that can be accomplished through more discriminate military means. Israel didn’t need to destroy every Hamas rocket launcher or kill every commander — but rather do just enough damage to buy itself some safety. “If your war aim is complete destruction of your adversary, then the military advantage of every strike increases because it’s a greater contribution to that aim,” says Adil Haque , a professor who studies the law and ethics of war at Rutgers University. “Given the physical layout of Gaza, you’re already setting yourself on a path toward killing tens of thousands of civilians.” A significant level of civilian death is inevitable in urban warfare, and especially in Gaza given Hamas’s despicable tactic of stationing military assets in and around schools and hospitals . The IDF is facing a profoundly challenging operating environment with few true historical parallels. Yet this does not absolve Israel of its decision to adopt a maximalist war aim or the unusually brutal tactics that followed from it. These were choices Israeli leaders made — and they were the wrong ones. Men walk through the rubble of a mosque that was destroyed during Israeli bombardment in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on February 14, 2024. Mohammed Abed/AFP via Getty Images The damning failure to plan for war’s end Lt. Col. Raphael Cohen is no one’s idea of a dove. As a US Army military intelligence officer, Cohen served two tours of combat duty in Iraq at the height of the anti-American insurgency. Now a reserve officer, he spends his days running a program on military strategy and doctrine at the RAND Institute. He has publicly argued that the reality on the ground in Gaza left Israel with little choice but to engage in the kind of war that it’s currently waging. Yet there’s one area where Cohen’s review of Israel’s conduct is quite harsh: its lack of planning for the day after the war. “They need to take the non-lethal side of the operation seriously,” he told me in late January. “If you don’t get the postwar planning right, whatever tactical gains you get are going to be fleeting.” In the outlines offered by Israeli leadership early in the war, “destroying Hamas” could only be accomplished by replacing its regime in Gaza with something new and durable. In October, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said this explicitly — that the war must end with the “creation of a new security regime in the Gaza Strip [and] the removal of Israel’s responsibility for day- to-day life in the Gaza Strip.” Regime change is the only conceivable way Israel could deliver on its long-shot objective of destroying Hamas. Yet, shockingly, Israel has no clear plan for what comes next. Every source I spoke to with knowledge of Israeli planning confirmed this; so does a volume of publicly available reporting and some recent comments from Netanyahu spokesperson Avi Hyman . “All discussions about the day after Hamas will be had the day after Hamas,” Hyman said during a press briefing. For quite some time after the war began, Israel refused to even conceive of a postwar plan. Some sources told me that preparations are getting underway, but there are still no firm conclusions nor any clear route to them. Netanyahu has publicly rejected an American proposal to place the Palestinian Authority (PA), led by the moderate Fatah faction based in the West Bank , in charge of Gaza after the war. He has offered no alternative in its place. Without a postwar plan, Israel risks something worse than failing to defeat Hamas: bolstering it. Masked men wearing Hamas headgear at a demonstration in Beirut on October 20, 2023. Joseph Eid/AFP/Getty Images According to Devorah Margolin , an expert on Hamas at the center-right Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the entire point of the October 7 attack was to provoke a massive Israeli response. Handbooks and guidance sheets discovered on killed and captured Hamas fighters revealed instructions to be graphically, sadistically violent — instructions we know were fully carried out . “The goal of that [ultraviolence] was to create a visceral response from Israel that would be seen as so disproportionate that the violence it carried out on October 7 was pushed to the side, and that Israel would be seen as the irrational actor,” she tells me. “In that sense, I think they actually succeeded.” In the long run, making Israel look like the depraved side serves two strategic goals for Hamas. First, it puts the Palestinian issue back at the top of the Arab and international political agenda. Second, it convinces Palestinians that Israel must be fought with arms — and that Hamas, rather than the more peace-oriented Fatah, should be leading their struggle. Polling data both in Palestine and elsewhere suggest that they have made inroads on both fronts since October 7. By inflicting mass suffering on Palestinians without a long-term plan for addressing the political consequences of their misery, Israel is playing right into Hamas’s hands. The current Israeli approach is less likely to destroy the militant group than to strengthen it. Blame Bibi Natan Sachs is the director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution — making him, more or less, the leading Israel expert at one of Washington’s leading nonpartisan think tanks. Few people outside of Israel know the country’s politics better than he does. When I spoke with Sachs in February, he told me that the mood in Israel “remains extremely grim and extremely vulnerable.” Israel’s war reflects a public that remains traumatized by October 7 and is convinced that they can only be protected by inflicting maximum destruction on Israel’s enemies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is intentionally stoking the fury. “Responsible leadership would not only channel the anger and the need for prevention in the future,” he says. “It would also try to shape public expectations about what the future might be.” This behavior is even worse than it sounds. Netanyahu is stoking war fervor without engaging in any serious planning for the postwar environment. It’s clear, both from speaking with knowledgeable observers and reading the Israeli press, that Netanyahu’s government is at the heart of this essential gap. “When you talk to the IDF folks, their issue is like any military’s — they follow the guidance they’re given from politicians, and there is no clear guidance,” Cohen tells me. “They feel hamstrung because they can’t get out too far ahead of where the government is.” Discontent with Netanyahu from inside the military is starting to go public. In late January, Defense Minister Gallant warned that “political indecision may harm the progress of the military operation” — suggesting that the government is shirking its duty to “discuss the plan … and determine the goal.” Why is Netanyahu refusing to do his job? The most likely explanation is crass politics. The prime minister’s ongoing corruption trial is very serious, with a conviction potentially leading to an extended stay behind bars . His primary motivation is staying in office and using that power to keep out of prison, which requires keeping his government together. As a result, his far- right coalition partners in the Religious Zionism faction — who oppose any Palestinian political control over Gaza and want to rebuild Israeli settlements there — have extraordinary influence over his decision-making. Benjamin Netanyahu with far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir last May. Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP/Getty Images To avoid crossing the far right, Netanyahu won’t allow for any serious planning for the war’s end. The necessary parts of any plan — adopting a concrete and achievable vision for victory and a realistic vision for a postwar order — would necessarily infuriate Religious Zionists and likely cause them to quit the coalition, thus throwing the country to new elections that Netanyahu will likely lose. The prime minister is very literally putting his own interests above the nation’s — something that Sachs says “wouldn’t be the case with many other [Israeli] leaders.” “This specific individual,” he adds, “is a constant politician — even in the worst of times.” Of course, pinpointing the roots of Israeli failures isn’t quite that simple. Israelis across the political spectrum immediately called for “destroying” Hamas in the wake of October 7, an understandable response to the day’s horror. Polling shows that the public is deeply divided on what the postwar political order in Gaza should look like, with no single option commanding majority support . Israelis are still traumatized and adrift, confident only that a return to the prewar status quo isn’t an option. But, as Sachs pointed out, it’s not a leader’s job to follow public opinion but rather to mold it. A moment when people are scared and uncertain, where the old security paradigm seems broken and no new one has emerged to replace it, is exactly the kind of time where leaders with vision can convince the public to follow them toward a better future. “Every question about Israel’s response has to be considered in light of the members of this government, and particularly Netanyahu’s dependence on the far right,” says Waxman, the UCLA professor. So if “Blame Bibi” is an oversimplification, it’s not much of one. At its heart, the war has gone badly because the man leading it is not up to the task. So long as his government remains in power, the odds of Israel climbing out of its moral and strategic nadir are negligible. Can things get better? Dana El Kurd is a senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington and a leading expert on Palestinian politics. When we talked about the scale of suffering in Gaza, the pain in her voice was palpable. “There’s not even words I can put to it,” she told me. Despite this, she managed to have some empathy for Israelis — and warn that their current approach isn’t going to make anything better for them. Based on everything she knows about the internal political dynamics of Palestine, continued mass killing will only empower its violent radicals in the long run. “I totally understand the shock of the October 7 moment, and what it might have meant to Israelis who thought they were immune,” she tells me. But making [Gaza] uninhabitable...is not going to resolve the conflict.” Palestinian children are silhouetted on a damaged tent following an Israeli airstrike in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, on February 12, 2024. Fatima Shbair/AP Photo Palestinians inspect damage to residential buildings in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, on February 12, 2024. AP Photo/Fatima Shbair The first step for things getting better is for Israel to take what El Kurd is saying seriously — and fundamentally revise its war aims accordingly. Israel could do this by committing to a version of the American proposal for the PA to take over Gaza, reorienting its strategy around laying the groundwork for PA entry. The PA has its flaws — it is both demonstrably corrupt and authoritarian — but it is at least credibly committed to peace. And there is no real alternative: An international occupation of Gaza is extremely unlikely, and an indefinite Israeli occupation would be a disaster for Israelis and Palestinians alike . “The big thing is that something needs to replace Hamas in Gaza, and I think the Biden administration pushing the PA is appropriate,” Byman says. “God help us all, but this is the best we got.” An alternative option is Israel abandoning its current hope for regime change in Gaza, instead seeking an indefinite ceasefire with Hamas in exchange for full release of the remaining Israeli hostages. This outcome would almost certainly leave Hamas in power. But it would stop a war that’s currently helping no one, allow for a flood of humanitarian aid to help Gazan civilians, and accomplish what a majority of Israelis now see as the primary war aim , bringing the hostages home. These approaches have their problems, but both are much better than the status quo. Yet Netanyahu has ruled them out, believing that his right flank would abandon him were he to take either option. This means one of two things has to happen: Netanyahu needs to be forced to hold elections or somehow pressured into changing policy. Part of the pressure will inevitably come domestically. Israeli frustration with the government’s handling of the war, especially its inability to bring the hostages home, is rising. 2024 has seen some return to anti-government protests that were common before the war (though currently at a much smaller scale). Relatives of Israeli hostages protest against Netanyahu’s government’s refusal to call a ceasefire and exchange hostages with Gaza, in Jerusalem on February 10, 2024. Saeed Qaq/Anadolu via Getty Images Other forms of pressure should come from foreign powers — which is also already happening. A group of Arab states are drafting a proposal in which they offer to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel in exchange for a ceasefire and “irreversible” moves toward a Palestinian state. The United States has issued a first-ever executive order sanctioning violent settlers in the West Bank — an economic weapon that could easily be directed against the extremist ministers in Netanyahu’s cabinet. These efforts can and should be expanded, especially on the American side. President Biden’s early and loud support for Israel after October 7 has bought him extraordinary goodwill inside Israel, where he has a roughly 68 percent approval rating . His popularity vastly outstrips Netanyahu’s, which means that the prime minister’s current antagonistic approach toward the White House may be a political miscalculation. But even if Netanyahu can be forced to change course — or simply forced out of power — the underlying problem will not be resolved. What is needed is not just a temporary peace, but a means to start addressing the roots of the conflict to ensure that the fighting doesn’t start up again. “The main thing is that people aren’t trying to solve the conflict,” el-Kurd insists. “That’s why the conflict is ongoing.” Any kind of real solution, then, aims at not just a temporary end to the fighting but resetting the fundamental dynamics of the conflict that brought us to such a terrible place. “Out of a deal to secure the release of the hostages could become a lasting ceasefire. And out of a lasting ceasefire could become a political process leading to the creation of a Palestinian state,” says Waxman. This is hard to imagine in the midst of war, with Hamas’s popularity among Palestinians surging and the two-state solution polling poorly among Israelis. But what’s true now may not continue to be true after the shooting stops. Aluf Benn, the editor of leading Israeli newspaper Haaretz, calls the period after October 7 “ a turning point ”: a moment where the traditional contours of politics have been called into question and it’s possible for things to go differently. “It is up to Israelis to decide what kind of turning point it will be,” he writes in Foreign Affairs . Benn is pessimistic that Israelis will take the opportunity to turn toward peace on their own. But there are also signs that the far right’s star is fading in Israel . And with the rest of the world renewing its attention to the conflict, new ideas are starting to emerge. The Arab states’ decision to tie future normalization to a Palestinian state, together with at least some American willingness to put pressure on Israel to change course, are signs that fundamental assumptions are being challenged. “The only silver lining of things being what they are is that, when they are so bad, people are actively thinking about making it better,” says Mira Sucharov , a political scientist at Carleton University in Ottawa. That this passes for optimism is a testament to the grim reality on the ground. So many innocent people have already died, and more will die every day until the war ends. Nothing can bring them back to life. But holding out some hope, even amid the darkness, is better than a descent into nihilism: a belief that Palestinians are defined by Hamas or Israelis by Netanyahu. They are not.

"2","The false idea that getting an abortion makes women irreparably depressed and anxious, that it causes a deep psychic wound, has for decades been used by anti-abortion activists to support abortion restrictions. But the argument is entirely based on anecdotes, personal beliefs, and vibes. No good science has demonstrated this link. That’s not because nobody’s tried to answer the question of what the mental health impacts of abortion are on the women who obtain them. It’s because the answer to that question, over and over again, is: none. In study after study , researchers have consistently shown that getting an abortion does not cause mental health problems. What does reliably worsen women’s mental health, however, is banning or restricting abortion access. A wealth of research has shown that when people are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies, it negatively impacts their physical health and finances — and mental health. In a survey conducted before the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, women living in states with more abortion restrictions had higher rates of mental distress . In another study, states enforcing abortion restrictions between 1974 and 2016 had higher suicide rates in women of childbearing age in particular. But when the court decided to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 , it wasn’t making a decision grounded in science. Now we’re more than a year and a half into living with the consequences. And when it comes to women’s mental health, the fallout is following the exact pattern scientists predicted. Research shows the thing we thought was true is, in fact, true In a study published last month, researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that people living in states that banned abortion in the immediate wake of the Court’s decision have worse symptoms of anxiety and depression than those who live in states without bans. Using data gathered as part of US Census Household Pulse surveys, the researchers looked at respondents’ self-reported anxiety and depression scores from about six months before and six months after the Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. They compared scores on a scale of zero to 12 among people in states with and without trigger bans , abortion restrictions that went into effect as soon as the Supreme Court issued its ruling. What they found was, frankly, predictable: Before the Court’s decision, anxiety and depression scores were already higher in trigger states — a population-wide average of 3.5 compared with 3.3 in non-trigger states. After the decision, that difference widened significantly, largely due to changes in the mental health of women 18 to 45, what the authors defined as childbearing age. Among this subgroup, anxiety and depression scores subtly ticked up in those living in trigger states (from 4.62 to 4.76) — and dropped in those living in non-trigger states (from 4.57 to 4.49). There was no similar effect in older women, nor in men. These differences were small but statistically meaningful, especially since they sampled the entire population, not just women considering an abortion. Moreover, they were consistent across trigger states, whether their policies and political battles around abortion had been high- or low-profile. Even when the researchers omitted data from states with particularly severe restrictions on women’s reproductive health ( looking at you , Texas ), the results held up. It’s notable that the different levels of mental distress across states after Roe was overturned weren’t just a consequence of worsened anxiety and depression in states with trigger bans. Also contributing: an improvement in these symptoms in states without these bans. We can’t tell from the study exactly why that is, but it seems plausible that women living in states that protect their right to access necessary health care simply feel some relief . Americans don’t need more mental health stressors right now In bird’s-eye-view studies like this, it can be hard to pick apart the nuances behind a finding. For example, it’s possible other social or cultural factors are more likely to disproportionately affect women in trigger states — like variability in gender equity, interpartner violence, abortion stigma, and mental health care access. Still, it should set off our alarm bells when high-quality research finds a causal relationship between big societal shifts and worsening depression and anxiety on a population-wide level. People who sense limitations to their personal freedom and autonomy feel a sense of “violation and powerlessness,” says Benjamin Thornburg, a health economics PhD student who led the study. It stands to reason that the opposite of that, a sense of freedom and autonomy, would improve people’s overall mental health. Anxiety and depression rates are reaching record highs and are especially pronounced among young adults , and suicide deaths are ticking up . At the same time, Americans are living in an age of broadly unmet mental health care needs: 160 million Americans live in areas with provider shortages and insurance denials, and only one-third of people diagnosed with a behavioral health condition get the care they need.

"2","The Supreme Court announced on Tuesday that it will not hear Coalition for TJ v. Fairfax County School Board , a lawsuit attacking a school admissions program that was considered a cutting-edge conservative idea a quarter century ago — and whose most prominent champion was Republican former President George W. Bush. Two justices dissented, with Justice Samuel Alito writing an angry opinion attacking a school admissions policy that closely mirrors Bush’s signature racial justice program. In the late 1990s, when Bush was governor of Texas, he signed legislation creating that state’s “ top 10 percent ” law for university admissions. As the name implies, Bush’s law guaranteed that Texas high school students who graduated in the top 10 percent of their class would be admitted to state-run universities. The program is still in effect, although the state’s flagship school, the University of Texas at Austin, only accepts the top 6 percent or so of students due to increased applications. Bush proudly touted this program as a way to racially diversify Texas universities and as alternative to race-conscious admissions programs that Republicans have long disdained (programs that were recently declared illegal by the Supreme Court’s GOP-appointed majority). As Bush said in 2000 while campaigning for the presidency, top 10 percent-style programs “ affect the pool of applicants of minority students available for higher ed in a positive way .” What sets Bush’s program apart from the Harvard and University of North Carolina affirmative action programs that were recently invalidated by the Court is that it does not consider the race of applicants. Under Harvard’s system, race could be used as a kind of tiebreaker to determine which of several exceptionally qualified applicants should be offered one of the very limited slots in Harvard’s freshman class. Under Bush’s program, by contrast, students are mechanically admitted based on their class ranking. Nevertheless, as Bush made perfectly clear many times, the purpose of this program was to achieve some degree of racial diversity in Texas’s public universities. It did so by leveraging the fact that many American communities remain racially segregated, which causes Black and Latino students to cluster in certain public high schools. The Coalition for TJ case involved the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (“TJ”), a public magnet school in northern Virginia known for outstanding STEM instruction. Until a few years ago, TJ used standardized tests to identify “semifinalists” for admissions, and admitted students were selected from these semifinalists based on their test scores, teacher recommendations, GPAs, and writing assignments applicants were required to complete. In late 2020, however, TJ changed its admission process to use a program similar to Bush’s system. Under TJ’s new system, the top 1.5 percent of students from middle schools eligible to send students to TJ are automatically admitted. The school then admits an additional 100 students based on other factors, such as GPA and whether the student comes from a middle school that has historically sent few students to TJ. Like Bush’s plan in Texas, this new admissions process does not take explicit account of race — indeed, TJ officials who screen applicants are not told each student’s race, gender, or name . However, also like Bush’s plan, there is considerable evidence that it was adopted in order to racially diversify the school. Among other things, the chair of the school board that adopted the new admissions program said it “ needed to be explicit in how we are going to address the underrepresentation ” of Black and Latino students at TJ. The question presented by the Coalition for TJ case, in other words, was whether a school may adopt admissions standards that don’t consider race, but that officials choose specifically because they know they will increase racial diversity at that school. As Alito notes in his opinion , the Supreme Court’s precedents ordinarily do not allow states to enact policies that were created for the “purpose” of giving an advantage to a particular racial group, even if they operate in a racially neutral way. That said, before the Supreme Court’s decision last year in the Harvard case, selective schools were allowed to take some limited account of race for the purpose of diversifying their student body. Harvard suggests that these sorts of programs are no longer allowed, but the Court’s decision to turn away the Coalition for TJ case is also a sign that most of the Court may still tolerate some attempts to racially diversify schools — so long as they use methods previously approved by Republicans. Notably, only Justice Clarence Thomas joined Alito’s Coalition for TJ opinion. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who often forms a three-justice MAGA coalition with Thomas and Alito, did not. In any event, the Court’s decision not to hear the case is evidence that a majority of the justices may tolerate top 10 percent- style programs, but it does not guarantee that they will. The Court could still agree to hear a similar case in the future — and it could potentially strike down Bush’s program when that happens. Should the Supreme Court rule that schools may not have such programs, it would be an extraordinary blow to diversity on campus that would stretch far beyond TJ. Top 10 percent-style programs now exist in several state university systems, including Texas and California — the two largest states. A decision against these programs, moreover, would show just how much the Republican Party has radicalized on the issue of race in the last two decades. Such a decision would almost certainly be joined only by Republican appointees to the Court, much like the Court’s decisions striking down Harvard and UNC’s policies.

"2","Russian dissident Alexei Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, announced Monday that she would take up her husband’s crusade against President Vladimir Putin following his death while in prison. “I have no right to give up,” Navalnaya said in a video address Monday. “I will continue the work of Alexei Navalny. I will continue to fight for our country, and I urge you to stand next to me.” Navalny campaigned against the Kremlin for more than a decade following widespread anger over Putin’s 2011 move to retake power. He was Putin’s most internationally known critic, and was the most recognizable to Russians, too, despite Putin’s refusal to say his name. In what amounts to an opposition in Russia , Navalny was essentially the only figure with broad name recognition. Now, Navalnaya will take up that mantle, but it’s not clear how far the Navalnys’ fight for a free Russia can go under such brutal repression — and with its most charismatic leaders either dead or in exile. Who is Yulia Navalnaya? Because of her husband’s work, Navalnaya has been in the public eye for over a decade — not exactly as a political wife or first lady figure, but more as a quiet, stoic partner, although she was a critical part of Alexey’s political activism as his closest adviser. That was intentional on her part; she supported her husband’s activism but wanted to make sure their children were well-adjusted. But that changed in 2020, after her husband was poisoned by the Kremlin. While her husband was fighting for his life surrounded by government agents in a hospital in the city of Omsk, she stood up to Putin, issuing a public letter demanding Alexei’s release to travel to Germany for care. It helped establish her as a national figure in her own right, projecting stoicism, grace under pressure, and defiance of the Kremlin all at once. “Russia is still a sexist country,” economist Sergei Guriev, a friend of the Navalny family and former adviser to Alexei, told journalist Julia Ioffe in 2021 . “People think that a woman is not an independent person, especially if she doesn’t work. Therefore, they didn’t understand that Yulia is an independent person. And then they understood. They saw Yulia fight the machine and win. I think for many people it was eye-opening.” In a 2013 interview with the now-exiled Russian TV channel TV Rain — her first, and one of few, according to Ioffe — the interviewer asked Navalnaya if she wanted her husband to stop his political activism, if only for the sake of their children, Zakhar and Daria. No, she told the interviewer, “Because it’s them he’s fighting for!” Navalnaya was always present in Navalny’s social media posts and in photos at protests and trials. Though she has occasionally spoken in public to supporters, in the past she has rarely granted interviews, in part to keep her family’s home life as normal and private as possible, but that is already changing as she takes up her husband’s cause; her surprise appearance Friday at the Munich Security Conference was the first signal of her new, more public role. The space for dissent in Russia is vanishingly small — but dissent is showing a different face That Navalnaya may become the most prominent Russian opposition figure says as much about Navalny’s organization and reputation and her own charisma as it does about the space for political dissent in Russia. Her self-imposed exile in Germany poses obvious challenges to creating any real political change — she is already being branded a Western puppet in Russian media, according to Reuters , and her distance will make it more difficult to unite a weak and fractured Russian opposition — but it also perhaps makes it possible to dissent at all. “For years before [Navalny’s death], the overall message has been, ‘There’s no alternative to Putin,’” Eliot Borenstein, vice provost for Global Programs at New York University, told Vox in an interview. “But that was within the pretext of there being some sort of democratic electoral system and so on. Now, there’s not even the slightest public wiggle room when it comes to opposition .” That leaves little opportunity for political organization even when causes and figures do emerge, but in addition to Navalnaya, there are vocal critics of the regime still inside Russia. “We should never underestimate the bravery and the brilliance and the courage of many, many Russians,” Graeme Robertson, director of the Center for Slavic, Eurasian, and East European Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told Vox. “People tend to paint Russians all with one brush as long-suffering and patient, and that’s not true of everybody, by any stretch of the imagination.” Ilya Yashin , another opposition politician and friend of Navalny who is now serving an eight-and-a- half-year prison term for sharing information about Russia’s murder of civilians in the Ukrainian city of Bucha, is a compelling, charismatic figure. On Tuesday, a letter mourning Navalny appeared on his X account, in which he vowed to continue his friend’s cause. “As long as my heart beats in my chest, I will fight tyranny. As long as I live, I will fear no evil. As long as I breathe, I will be with my people,” Yashin wrote. Vladimir Kara-Murza, a British Russian journalist and democracy activist currently in prison in Russia for opposing Russia’s invasion, is also a vocal figure with international ties and name recognition — and boasts a partner who has vocally taken up the cause for a free Russia while her husband is in prison. Evgenia, Kara-Murza’s wife, spoke to Time magazine about Navalny’s death and Navalnaya’s decision to carry on in his stead: “I see that this fight is getting an increasingly pronounced feminine face,” she said. “It’s those women who stand up because their loved ones were either killed or are in jail, both in Russia and in Belarus. And I believe this is actually a good thing because women can bring that long-forgotten understanding of values back to the world of politics; that understanding that you should act based on your values and not on your interests.” That “feminine face,” as Kara-Murza said, is not new, but it could be effective in connecting with and organizing Russian women, especially around opposition to the war as Russian men come back from the front line permanently injured, psychologically damaged — or not at all. Feminist Anti-War Resistance (FAR), which is one of the fastest-growing protest movements within Russia, according to the Financial Times , already threw its support behind Navalnaya in a Facebook post . Another important activist space is the Russian LGBTQ community, which has faced increasing repression under Putin. Alexandra Skochilenko , a queer artist jailed for seven years over an antiwar protest — switching five price tags in a grocery store with information about the war — has gained international attention for her protest. “How weak is our prosecutor’s faith in our state and society if he thinks our statehood and public safety can be ruined by five little pieces of paper?” Skochilenko said at her trial. “Everyone sees and knows that you are not judging a terrorist. You’re not trying an extremist. You’re not even trying a political activist. You’re judging a pacifist.” Though there are still glimmers of opposition within Russia, any real challenge to Putin likely will not come from society, as Liana Fix and Maria Snegovaya wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this month. When Putin goes — whether it’s because of his health, the war, or his policies — it’s likely to be the political elite that pushes him, and that almost certainly will not result in a Russia aligned with Navalnaya’s goals.

"2","For the third time since war broke out in Gaza in October, the US vetoed a ceasefire resolution at the United Nations on Tuesday — even as it unveiled its own draft resolution that goes further in criticizing Israel than it had in the past. It’s a sign that, despite increasingly critical rhetoric from American officials and President Joe Biden , the US is still trying to influence strategy by working with Israel rather than openly opposing its war efforts, which comes in response to Hamas ’s October 7 attack on Israel and in which more than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed. The failed Algerian-led resolution called for an immediate ceasefire, an end to the “forced displacement of the Palestinian civilian population in violation of international law,” the unconditional release of all Israeli hostages, and “unfettered humanitarian access into and throughout Gaza.” That’s in contrast to an alternative draft resolution proposed by the US, which calls for a temporary ceasefire “as soon as practicable,” condemns Hamas, rejects a planned Israeli ground invasion in southern Gaza, demands the release of all hostages captured by Hamas, and reiterates the US vision for a two-state solution to end the conflict. That’s further than the US has been willing to go in the past. But in keeping with US policy, the resolution does not go so far as to make any urgent demands of Israel that would potentially drive the country away from the negotiating table, which the Biden administration argues is the avenue most likely to produce a lasting end to hostilities. “It seems to me that all of this has to be premised on the idea that everybody is involved in the negotiation,” said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They didn’t want the word ‘immediate’ because they thought that would undermine discussions about hostages.” There has been increasing pressure, in Israel and internationally, to secure a hostage deal. An estimated 132 of the original 250 hostages taken by Hamas and its allies during their October 7 attack on Israel remain captive or are presumed dead . Thousands recently protested in Tel Aviv to demand a hostage deal and new elections . Families of hostages and their supporters also interrupted a meeting of the Israeli Knesset last month to press for a deal. Biden sent CIA director Bill Burns to Cairo to meet with Egyptian, Israeli, and Qatari officials in his latest attempt to shepherd a deal. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had embarked on a similar mission earlier this month before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the proposed terms as “ delusional .” Echoing Alterman’s point, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield argued Tuesday that the Algerian resolution would “hinder ... sensitive ongoing negotiations” around a hostage deal. The resolutions come as Israel considers a ground invasion of Rafah , the southernmost city in Gaza whose border crossing with Egypt has remained largely closed. Israel claims Rafah is the last remaining Hamas stronghold, but any operation there would lead to “carnage,” according to the United Nations . That’s in large part because the city’s population is roughly five times larger than it was before the war , swollen by refugees fleeing the fighting further north. Amar Bendjama, the Algerian ambassador to the UN, said Tuesday that the UN had waited long enough for hostage talks to progress without any results to show for it, including for several weeks after the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel has to take stronger measures to protect Palestinian civilians and to provide humanitarian aid. “Throughout this process, we have heard calls to give time to a parallel track, with concerns raised that any action from the Council would jeopardize these efforts. However, almost one month after the ICJ orders, signs of hope are still absent for improvement on the situation in Gaza,” he said. “Silence is not a viable option. Now is the time for action and the time for truth.” What a US-sponsored temporary ceasefire resolution would mean The fact that the US would support a ceasefire resolution at all marks a significant shift in rhetoric: The last time there was a ceasefire resolution under consideration at the UN, the US objected to using the word “ceasefire” at all. That no longer appears to be the case, with Biden saying earlier this month that Israel had been “over the top” in its approach in Gaza and that civilian suffering and death “had to stop.” “The tides are shifting,” Alterman said. “The US is still trying to maintain a compromise position between global opinion that is increasingly impatient for an end to the fighting and the Israeli view that the fighting stops when the work is done.” Opinion isn’t just changing in the US. All the other UN Security Council member states supported the Algerian resolution, except the United Kingdom, which abstained. The resolution would have needed nine votes to be adopted and no vetoes from permanent members: the US, UK, France, Russia , and China . The question is whether this will have any impact on Israel’s war strategy. Though Israel would be legally bound to abide by any resolution adopted by the UN Security Council, the US’s draft resolution doesn’t actually impose any meaningful obligation for Israel to cease hostilities; just that it do so “as soon as practicable,” which likely won’t be anytime soon by Netanyahu’s definition. A vote is not yet scheduled on the US resolution, and it’s unclear when, and if, it will be. Netanyahu has vowed to continue Israel’s fight until it has achieved a “ total victory ” that involves Hamas’s destruction. Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, reiterated that point on Tuesday, saying that a ceasefire would be a “death sentence” for Israelis and Gazans because it would allow Hamas to regroup and rearm. But Hamas has so far withstood Israel’s attacks; it’s unclear that a ground invasion in Rafah would change that. It’s also unclear how much of the US’s resolution — and Israel’s threats of a Rafah invasion — are just posturing to increase pressure on hostage negotiators to work out a deal. It’s clear that American goodwill is running out, and Israel does not want to lose its staunchest defender. But at the same time, Israel may be hoping to secure more favorable terms in any deal by proving to the world that it’s not bluffing about invading Rafah and potentially displacing Palestinians into Egypt. Meanwhile, the US is continuing to offer military support to Israel. The US is making major arms sales to Israel , and Israel is already receiving $3.8 billion annually from the US through 2028 under a decade-long memorandum of understanding signed under the Obama administration. The US Senate approved an additional $14 billion in military aid for Israel earlier this month. House Republicans are so far refusing to vote on the bill, which they want tied to border security provisions, and House progressives could also undermine the Democratic effort to push it through. If that aid goes through, Biden has attached requirements to it that would require foreign recipients of US aid, including Israel, to provide assurances that they’re abiding by international humanitarian law or else risk having that aid suspended. But the question is whether those requirements will be enforced. Israel is already subject to similar requirements in existing US law, but historically, they have not been used to withhold military aid . “I think the hope is they can shift Israeli decision-making without materially restricting support — to leave it in a more cooperative context,” Alterman said.

"2","The moment the US Supreme Court released its decision overruling Roe v. Wade , pretty much everyone who closely follows constitutional law wondered which rights would be next on the chopping block. Justice Clarence Thomas stoked these fears with a concurring opinion calling for the Court to “reconsider” the rights to contraception, marriage for same-sex couples, and the right to choose who you have sex with (and whether those sexual partners share your gender). Justice Brett Kavanaugh, meanwhile, published his own concurrence claiming many of these rights were safe. In Alabama, at least, it now appears likely that the right to conceive a child through in vitro fertilization will be the next to fall. On Friday, that state’s Supreme Court released an opinion holding that frozen, fertilized embryos stored in a cryogenic facility count as a “child” under the state’s law permitting lawsuits while a child is killed. As the Medical Association of the State of Alabama warned the state’s justices before they handed down this decision, this decision is likely to “substantially increase” the cost of a common fertility treatment pursued by many parents who have trouble conceiving. Indeed, it could make these costs “prohibitive” (or, at least, even more prohibitive than they already are). In vitro fertilization (“IVF”) is a process where human eggs are fertilized outside of the womb, and later implanted in a human uterus. Typically, more eggs are fertilized than will actually be used, and the unused eggs are frozen. Among other things, this allows the unused eggs to be used later if the couple wants to have another child, and it also allows them to be used if the first attempt to implant some of the eggs does not take. At some point, however, the stored eggs are destroyed or used in medical research. Moreover, according to the Mayo Clinic, “ not all embryos will survive the freezing and thawing process .” So the destruction of at least some embryos is a normal part of IVF. The potential implications of the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision in Burdick-Aysenne v. Center for Reproductive Medicine , the decision holding that Alabama’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act extends to frozen embryos, are pretty obvious. If it is illegal to destroy an embryo, then it is unclear if IVF can happen. And, if it can happen, medical facilities may have to pay outlandish costs to store frozen embryos long after it is clear that no one will ever use them. That said, there are some quirks in Alabama law that may prevent this decision from reaching too far. The Wrongful Death of a Minor Act only permits civil lawsuits in limited circumstances. And Alabama’s criminal homicide law applies only to “ an unborn child in utero ” — meaning that the embryo or fetus is inside a uterus — so it is far from clear that someone may be criminally prosecuted for homicide if they harm an embryo stored in a cryogenic facility. Nevertheless, Burdick-Aysenne is the latest of several decisions by the state Supreme Court that read that state’s law creatively to expand the state’s authority over fetal or embryonic life. And the Alabama Supreme Court is an elected body controlled entirely by Republicans. So there is good reason for Alabamans seeking IVF treatment to fear that this court will shut down such care altogether. Burdick-Aysenne involves activity that should be illegal, just not necessarily under Alabama’s wrongful death statute The facts underlying the Burdick-Aysenne case are very unfortunate, and they allegedly involve negligent actions that very much should have triggered a lawsuit. Three couples received IVF treatments, and many of the resulting embryos were stored in a medical center’s cryogenic nursery. According to the state Supreme Court, in 2020 “a patient at the Hospital managed to wander into the Center’s fertility clinic through an unsecured doorway ,” where they removed several embryos and destroyed them. The couples then sued the medical facility for failing to adequately secure these embryos. So, if you ignore the fact that Burdick-Aysenne involves fertilized embryos, it could be a fairly unremarkable case. The plaintiffs entrusted something precious to the defendants’ care, and the defendants failed to protect it. In addition to suing under the Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, the plaintiffs also raised ordinary negligence and breach-of-contract claims. That said, they had good reason to prefer a court decision awarding them victory under the wrongful death statute because that statute allows them to collect more money than they would be entitled to under their alternative legal theories. As Justice Will Sellers wrote in a partial dissent, “these cases concern nothing more than an attempt to design a method of obtaining punitive damages .” The state’s wrongful death statute permits the parents of a deceased “minor child” to sue anyone who caused the death of that child, if the death was “caused by the wrongful act, omission, or negligence of any person, persons, or corporation.” The plaintiffs claimed that a frozen embryo counts as a “minor child” under this statute. Most of the state’s justices obliged this attempt to read the wrongful death statute broadly, and they did so in an opinion that is laden with the sort of rhetoric commonly found in anti-abortion literature. Among other things, the court’s majority opinion claims that a provision of the state constitution proclaiming that “it is the public policy of this state to ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child in all manners and measures lawful and appropriate” requires Alabama’s courts to “ construe ambiguous statutes in a way that ‘protect[s] … the rights of the unborn child’ equally with the rights of born children ” — at least when such a construction is “lawful and appropriate.” The path that led the state Supreme Court to conclude that a frozen embryo counts as a “minor child,” however, involved some fairly tortured construction of state law. And it also is just the latest step in a series of decisions stretching back more than a dozen years. In 1993, the state Supreme Court held that the wrongful death statute does not apply “ if the fetus was not viable at the time of death .” This decision, however, was overruled in Mack v. Carmack (2011). Mack justified this decision to overrule precedent by pointing to a new Alabama criminal law, which made it a homicide crime to kill “ an unborn child in utero at any stage of development, regardless of viability .” The Wrongful Death of a Minor Act permits civil lawsuits, not criminal prosecutions, so it is far from clear why this amendment to the state’s criminal law should have any impact whatsoever on a separate, civil statute. Nevertheless, Mack concluded that “it would be ‘incongruous’ if ‘a defendant could be responsible criminally for the homicide of a fetal child but would have no similar responsibility civilly.’” And so it read the criminal statute to effectively extend the scope of Alabama’s civil law. More recently, in Burdick-Aysenne , the defendants argued that Mack does not apply to cryogenic embryos. Again, Mack relied on a criminal statute that prohibits killing an “unborn child in utero” to extend the state’s civil wrongful death statute. But embryos stored in a cryogenic facility are not “in utero.” The Alabama Supreme Court, however, rejected this argument. If you are confused by all of these legal developments, you should be. In Mack , the state Supreme Court held that a criminal statute could be read to modify an entirely separate, civil statute. Then, in Burdick-Aysenne , the Court held that the civil statute should be extended again to apply to embryos outside of the uterus — even though the statute that the court relied on in Mack applies only to an “unborn child in utero.” Needless to say, this is not how legal interpretation typically works — especially in an age when “ textualism ,” the idea that judges should hew closely to a statute’s text while interpreting it, is very much in vogue. So what are the broader implications of Burdick-Aysenne ? Two fairly strong legal arguments could be raised in a future case to limit the scope of Burdick-Aysenne — and to potentially, prevent the catastrophic consequences for IVF patients predicted by the state medical association. One is that the state’s wrongful death of a minor statute only allows three individuals to sue if a child (or, after Burdick-Aysenne , a frozen embryo) is killed: the mother, the father, or the child’s “personal representative” — the term Alabama uses for the executor of a deceased person’s estate. So, in the hypothetical case where a cryogenic facility destroys long-unused embryos produced by a long-ago-forgotten IVF procedure, the facility could only be sued by one of these three individuals. The other argument that could be raised to limit the scope of Burdick-Aysenne is that the state’s criminal homicide law only applies to “an unborn child in utero.” So, even if the wrongful death statute permits civil lawsuits against a medical facility, the state’s criminal law explicitly does not permit prosecutions for destroying an embryo that is not inside a uterus. But the tortured legal reasoning animating Mack and Burdick-Aysenne should cause any medical facility pause before they rely on the explicit language of Alabama’s criminal statutes to determine if they can be prosecuted. If the court can hold that a criminal statute amends a different, unrelated civil statute, then there’s no guarantee it won’t read that criminal statute to exclude the words “in utero.” More broadly, the story of reproductive freedom in post- Roe America has been a story of uncertainty . After Roe was struck down, a raft of criminal abortion prohibitions suddenly sprung to life in many red states. Many of these prohibitions have never been construed by any court, and some health providers have been reluctant to perform even lifesaving abortions that are protected by state law — because they have no way of knowing if the state courts will honor that protection. In Alabama, that uncertainty now extends to medical facilities that provide IVF care. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Wisconsin now has legislative maps that align more closely with voters’ political preferences, a significant development that will fuel more competitive contests and could break Republicans’ longstanding grip on its legislature. The maps, which were approved by both chambers of the Republican- led state legislature and signed into law by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers on Monday, change the breakdown of the state’s Assembly and Senate districts from predominantly GOP leaning to nearly evenly split between the two parties. This redistricting means that Democrats actually have a shot of retaking the majority of the State Assembly in November, a prospect that was virtually impossible under the state’s prior maps, which the GOP had heavily gerrymandered in their favor. Shifts in the composition of the legislature could be huge both for the types of policies passed and for executive power. Shortly before Evers first took office, GOP lawmakers in the state voted to weaken the governor’s powers — something Democrats could change. In a state fairly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, the new maps could also make the legislature more representative of the distribution of voters’ political beliefs. ( Per the AP , of the last 17 statewide elections, Democrats have won 14, but Republicans have maintained control of the legislature for more than a decade.) And new toss-up districts will create real campaigns in purple areas, giving those voters an actual say in who represents them. “When I promised I wanted fair maps — not maps that are better for one party or another, including my own — I damn well meant it,” Evers said. “Wisconsin is not a red state or a blue state — we’re a purple state, and I believe our maps should reflect that basic fact.” The key changes to the maps, briefly explained According to an analysis from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the state will move from having 64 Republican-leaning Assembly seats to 46 out of 99; 45 will lean Democratic, and eight will have no partisan lean. Additionally, it will go from 22 Republican-leaning Senate seats to 15 out of 33. Fourteen will lean Democratic, and four are expected to be true toss-ups. “This is a turning point in the balance of power in Wisconsin state government. It upends over a decade of guaranteed Republican control,” University of Wisconsin-La Crosse political scientist Anthony Chergosky tells Vox. Previously, Wisconsin’s gerrymandered maps ensured that Republicans would maintain their hold on the legislature even if Democrats won the statewide popular vote in an election. The new changes follow significant court battles over Wisconsin’s legislative maps, which the GOP had been fighting to keep as is. That fight went all the way to the now liberal-leaning state Supreme Court , which declared the old maps unconstitutional last year. Faced with a choice between adopting a map drawn by the Wisconsin Supreme Court or the maps passed Monday, which were proposed by Evers, GOP lawmakers chose the latter, fearing a court-drawn map would be even more favorable to Democrats. Chergosky noted that the election of liberal justice Janet Protasiewicz in 2023 “utterly transformed the politics of redistricting in this state.” Protasiewicz’s presence gave liberals a majority on Wisconsin’s State Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years. The impact this could have The near-term impact of the new maps could be evident this fall, when Democrats have a real chance of winning the majority in the state Assembly. Because half of Wisconsin’s state Senate terms are up every two years, Democrats won’t have a chance to flip enough seats to take the majority in that chamber for at least a few terms. But that they even have the potential to win the state Assembly this year is groundbreaking, and it has major implications for democracy in the state. “The most likely outcome this November is that the party that wins the majority of the vote will win the majority of the state Assembly. That has not been the outcome for over a decade in Wisconsin,” John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette Law School, told Vox. Under divided government, with the Assembly controlled by one party and the Senate another, there would likely still be gridlock. But Democratic control of even a single chamber would force more compromise on items like the state’s budget, which could mean different levels of funding for key priorities like education and childcare. Longer term, if Democrats gain control of both chambers (and if Evers or another Democrat wins the 2026 gubernatorial race), they’d be able to pass even more expansive policies, with experts noting that marijuana legalization and Medicaid expansion are likely to be on the docket. Under those circumstances, lawmakers could also approve stronger protections for abortion rights in the state, where its Supreme Court is being asked to review whether access to legal abortions can continue. Michigan, which has a Democratic trifecta in both its legislative chambers and governor’s office, has rolled back restrictive abortion and labor laws and approved new policies that promote the use of clean energy , for example. Johnson notes that it’s a good case study of what’s possible with Democratic control. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","T he Office of Global Michigan is encouraging “everyday Americans” to volunteer to house illegal immigrants and “ make a difference by welcoming refugees from around the world.” “Volunteers [are] needed” to “support refugee resettlement efforts in Michigan,” says the office’s website, which was recently launched by the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Development. (READ MORE: Chaos at the Border, Finger-Pointing in Congress ) The initiative comes as states around the nation struggle to house the millions of illegal immigrants flooding the nation — leading many state governments to take unprecedented and fiscally irresponsible steps to try to address the situation. With the lack of regulations or oversight for those entering the United States, these moves to house illegal immigrants with residents aren’t just unwise, they threaten the safety of everyone involved. A Migrant Wave Like Never Before U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it has apprehended 169 individuals whose names appear on the terrorist watchlist, arrested 35,433 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions or outstanding warrants nationwide, including 598 known gang members, and seized 27,293 pounds of fentanyl, which is enough to kill more than 6 billion people, at the southern border in just fiscal year 2023. In a five-day period in December, Border Patrol processed and released nearly 50,000 illegal immigrants into the United States, according to data obtained by CBS News. During that month, 300,000 migrants, or enough to fill the city of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania, crossed the border. That number doesn’t account for so-called gotaways, or illegal immigrants who don’t encounter Border Patrol agents. According to the Washington Examiner , there have been at least 1.6 million gotaways since President Joe Biden took office, the majority of whom are “ single, military age men.” These massive numbers of largely unvetted illegal immigrants are a safety concern, especially when a program is encouraging citizens to allow migrants into their homes. (READ MORE: True Facts About America ) It’s even more concerning that just last week, published emails between journalists and Department of Homeland Security officials revealed that the federal government is not tracking the movements of illegal immigrants once they are released into the country. “It is hard for us to be able to answer that,” the official wrote in response to a question about the movements of migran ts. Michael Chamberlain, the director of Protect the Public’s Trust, spoke to Just the News about the emails. “DHS attempts to claim they are not responsible for the crisis at the border and lack any means to solve the fast-developing disaster,” he said. “At the same time, they admit to friendly members of the media off the record that they fail to perform even the most basic of functions.” States Are Scrambling All this has left states scrambling to find some way to deal with the record numbers of migrants crossing the southern border every day and they are quickly running out of resources to deal with the problem. Massachusetts is spending $64 a day per migrant just to feed the migrants it is housing in hotels across the state — which it is required to do under the state’s “Right to Shelter” law. In August, the state began pushing for residents, busines s owners, and colleges to house illegal immigrants. New York has also been hard hit by the massive influx of migrants, infamously forcing some students into remote learning so it could house illegal immigrants in the school buildings. Many homeless advocates and politicians, on both sides of the political aisle, have pushed back against these measures supporting illegal immigrants. “Refugees in their 20’s get more than what retirees who worked & paid taxes get from social security,” U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said . (READ MORE: Mayor Eric Adams: The $53 Million Man ) New York City Mayor Eric Adams is also facing a lawsuit from homeless advocates, who are arguing that American citizens are being neglected as the city works to provide housing for 65,000 migrants a year. “The mayor’s disrespect for everyday New Yorkers, especially those facing homelessness, not to mention this council and our speaker, is shameful,” said Democrat New York City Council Member Tiffany Cabán. The concerns about these issues are widespread around the nation. “Americans need to be first,” said a veteran in the Tribune Chronicl e, a small paper in Ohio. Is Michigan Next? In Michigan’s case, many are concerned that the measures to house migrants that are currently voluntary will soon become “mandatory.” These concerns aren’t unfounded. The U.K. recently began seizing properties to house illegal immigrants. There is also some evidence that population experts and the Michigan government are intentionally pushing for foreign migrants to come to the state, as a solution to the state’s “shrinking population.” “Last week, after pointing to the fact that this was occurring to replace existing Michigan residents…I was censured, defamed and had my staff/office budget displaced,” said state Rep. Joshua Schriver on X, in response to the news about the housing program. “Can’t stop. Won’t stop. I love all Michigan residents too much.” Last week, after pointing to the fact that this was occurring to replace existing Michigan residents…I was censured, defamed and had my staff/office budget displaced. Can’t stop. Won’t stop. I love all Michigan residents too much. – Representative @JoshuaSchriver (MI-66) — Rep. Joshua Schriver (@JoshuaSchriver) February 19, 2024 Residents who participate in the housing program must make a 90-day commitment, according to Fox 2. Michigan is also asking residents to make donations so it can provide housing, legal services, and interpretation to migrants and education for K–12 children. “The Office of Global Michigan’s goal is to make Michigan the home for opportunity for our immigrant, refugee and ethnic communities,” said Poppy Hernandez, Michigan’s chief equity and inclusion officer and director of the Office of Global Michigan. “With expanded refugee resettlement pathways, everyday Michiganders can provide refuge and build a state where people are welcomed with open arms.” Welcoming unvetted migrants with open arms is what states like Massachusetts and New York have tried — and it is destroying them. Michigan should learn from those failed policies, or taxpayers will be the ones opening their wallets and their homes."

"1","T he day had started out calm and sunny, until, for some strange reason, I opened the newspaper. There I learned that there is a mad scientist working to resurrect the extinct woolly mammoth . Seriously. A company named Colossal is working on it. And the mammoth could be running around the Arctic Circle again in 2027. It must be quite an experience to come back to life in Siberia after 4,000 years and have your head smashed in by Putin with a missile. The plan is seamless. They are creating a mammoth embryo from DNA samples from previous investigations. Since they are missing some parts of the DNA, they have borrowed some from the Asian elephant, with which the mammoth shares 99 percent of its genetic code. The remaining 1 percent will be taken from Al Gore. Environmentalists are worried, but not because, instead of a mammoth, a giant dinosaur could be born and end up crushing children in parks and pushing little old ladies on pedestrian crossings — nothing like that. They are worried because they consider it cruel to bring into the world an animal that may have forgotten how to defend itself in its habitat. In fact, I don’t know much about the evolution of species, but, if it’s extinct, I imagine it failed in that area once already. I’m fine with scientists having fun in their labs. I do it in my work, too, when I sit down drunk, to write, fill the page with random characters, and tell my editor I’m taking a conceptual writing approach. But then you have to accept the consequences. I say that because there was a Chinese guy having fun once in a lab in Wuhan, and you know the rest of the story. It is likely that the guy is now more extinct than the woolly mammoth, even though to this day nobody assumed the consequences of all that. A few years ago, we learned that Bill Gates invested in a solar geoengineering company. To put it in a way we can all understand, it’s all about blocking the sun a little bit. What you do with your finger sometimes, but on a cosmic scale. The consequences are so uncertain that 400 scientists signed a letter asking for an agreement not to use this technique. As this is a crazy and completely stupid idea, the U.N. is now very interested in advancing it. Just this week, Switzerland has proposed the creation of the first U.N. expert group on solar geoengineering to examine opportunities to turn off the sun. I hope I will be called in as an expert, as no one spends more hours than I do in the sun at the beach bar from May to September, and I know exactly how to defend myself from the heat in those circumstances, although my doctor is always critical of my techniques. Now all scientific experiments are sold as a form of salvation for Humanity. The same people who proclaim the climate apocalypse invest in multimillion-dollar projects to curb its consequences. You know — you ride a scooter to work, and they invest a week’s profits in a company that manufactures rockets to take children and women to another planet when everything starts to burn. We all save the planet, and in the meantime, I guess, they speculate and win. Because guys like Gates never lose. Now that farmers all over the world are at war against green laws that cause their ruin, I miss guys like Gates in the middle of the tractor demonstration, explaining to the farm kids that they’re going to spray the sun with I-don’t-know-what to make it less hot. That would be a nice sight. Especially when they ask him what happens if something goes wrong and a blue screen appears on the sun, forcing us to warm up in the future with Scarlett Johansson movies. Not so long ago, the scientific community and the media were talking about bioethics. There were discussions arguing about where the moral boundaries of scientific experimentation should be. As the Left wanted, today there are no moral limits in almost any field, and mad scientists and entrepreneurs are taking advantage of the vacuum. Now they are merely outraged by the consequences when something goes wrong. I don’t know about you, but, personally, from politics to science, I’m starting to get a bit fed up with experts creating a problem for every solution. The only good thing about this is that, if they finally manage to bring back the extinct woolly mammoth, we will be one step closer to them being able to bring Joe Biden back to life.

"1","Russia recently placed Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas on a “wanted” list , accusing her of “crimes” that include the destruction of Soviet-era monuments in memory of Soviet soldiers in Estonia — a significant escalation in Putin’s pressure campaign in Eastern Europe. In the Estonian parliamentary system, Kallas is the head of the government, the person empowered to lead the country (the president is merely a ceremonial figurehead). Targeting her as a “criminal” represents a major step for several reasons, she not only has a senior governmental position, but she is also well-connected throughout the EU and NATO communities, well-spoken in English, French, and Russian, and widely identified as one of Europe’s most dedicated and articulate supporters of the Ukrainian cause. (READ MORE: Alexei Navalny’s Death Is Not the Most Outrageous Demise Today ) When Kallas speaks — and she has spoken with great frequency and passion regarding the threat from Putin’s Russia — her voice reaches well beyond what one might expect from the leader of a country roughly the size of Vermont or New Hampshire. One might mock the “crimes” she is accused of or dismiss them as simply yet another example of random bluster from Putin, but this would be a grievous error. Viewing what happens to Putin’s enemies — for example, the death of Alexei Navalny — one hopes that Prime Minister Kallas has a very good security detail. Regardless of the personal threat to Kallas, this Russian threat, and similar ones aimed at officials in Latvia and Lithuania, signal that the ground is being prepared for a Russian attack on the Baltic states. As we’ve seen before in Ukraine and elsewhere, an attempt to criminalize a country’s leaders and institutions represents the preparatory stage for, first, escalating subversion and, eventually, an outright attack. Moving In on the Baltic States When might this attack take place? A recent and widely publicized report from Estonia’s foreign intelligence service suggests that the Russian military threat is already materializing. How soon and to what extent remains, in large part, a function of what Russia will be able to set aside while continuing its war with Ukraine , but the report posits the emergence of a significant threat within the next decade and, were Ukraine to collapse, the threat could come much sooner — perhaps in as little as three years, timed to take advantage of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, frequently mooted for 2027 . It’s not for nothing that tiny Estonia, in addition to ramping up its own military expenditures and training posture, has also diverted scarce weaponry to Ukraine, which they believe is fighting NATO’s fight. Like the other “frontline” NATO members, its defense spending is above the much-discussed 2 percent of GDP target. Unfortunately, an attack on Estonia might not begin with Russian tanks rolling across the Narva bridge. More likely there would be a first phase — a “gray zone” that combined cyber attacks and terrorist actions conducted by the proverbial “little green men.” After the debacle of its march on Moscow, the Wagner group was allowed to relocate to bases in Belarus, strategically placing it near Poland and the Baltic states. Moreover, each of the Baltic states has a substantial minority Russian population, the legacy of Stalin-era forcible relocations and outright colonization. Subversion and destabilization, after all, have become the coinage of Russia’s way of war. A further component might be called “de- legitimization.” While Putin assured Tucker Carlson that he had no interest in attacking the Baltic states or Poland, Prime Minister Kallas was being threatened by the Russian state. Repeatedly, and in all three Baltic states, the Russian government has promoted a narrative in which the Russian minorities are suffering various forms of mistreatment. The template being used is precisely the same as the one used in Ukraine: Undermine the legitimacy of the government, attack the culture as “racist,” “Nazi,” or simply “corrupt,” and then invent provocations that might justify the invocation of Joe Biden’s infamous “minor incursion.” (READ MORE: Putin Loves Biden ) The salient difference between Estonia (and its equally vulnerable Baltic neighbors, Latvia, and Lithuania) and Ukraine is that, unlike Ukraine, it is a NATO member, and, under Article 5, an attack on it constitutes an attack on all NATO members, including the United States. Unfortunately, this means less than we might hope. Contrary to widespread belief, even among foreign policy mavens, Article 5 does not obligate other members to respond militarily in the event one member is attacked. Instead, the relevant language reads : “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all and … each of them … will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking … such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force.” Article 5 Doesn’t Protect the Baltic States This qualifying language, so often ignored, was included in the original NATO treaty at the insistence of the U.S., contrary to the wishes of many of the original European signatories. At the height of the Cold War, what guaranteed a U.S. military response was not treaty language but the presence of the U.S. Seventh Army astride Germany’s Fulda Gap, squarely in the path of a likely Soviet attack. Dead American soldiers assured a U.S. military response, not the language of Article 5. Significantly, the only time that Article 5 has called forth a response came following the 9/11 attacks. When the U.S. was attacked, virtually every NATO country came to our assistance by sending troops to Afghanistan, some at considerable sacrifice. Estonia, for example, placed no restrictions on the troops it deployed, which led to their operating in conjunction with the British in the hellhole that was Helmand province. Nine Estonian soldiers were killed. For most Americans, this sounds trivial. But when considering them as a percentage of a country’s population, viewed in terms of the numbers of friends and families directly affected, their casualties were equivalent to some 2200 Americans — not notably less than the number of American soldiers killed in Afghanistan. (READ MORE: Ukraine and Russia Battle for Avdiivka ) Did this earn them the “right” to our protection? Unfortunately, talk of “rights” rarely survives first contact with the dictates of realpolitik . One could argue, after all, that we assumed a measure of moral responsibility for Ukraine in 1994 when Bill Clinton pressured them to surrender what was then the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world, offering in return only contemptibly nebulous security assurances. Put very simply, there’s nothing in writing that obligates the U.S. to a military response in the event of a Russian attack on Estonia, its Baltic neighbors, or indeed any of the other NATO “frontline” states. Few American voters understand how these states came to our assistance after 9/11, or that, unlike some larger NATO states, these countries now devote much more than the oft-ballyhooed 2 percent in defense expenditure. Few American voters seem to care. America First Doesn’t Equal Isolationism They might care more if they understood that it’s in our interest to stand up for countries that have chosen to stand with us, not out of some emotional tie or obligation, but rather to assure a world aligned with our most practical political, social, and economic interests. A “realistic” foreign policy takes its cue from Lord Palmerston’s famous dictum , that nations have neither eternal allies, nor perpetual enemies, but rather “interests that are eternal and perpetual.” What are our eternal and perpetual interests? Above all, our interests include our right to live unmolested here at home, within our borders, and our right to interact freely around the world, with other similarly independent and like- minded nations. It’s worth noting that just such a vision was articulated by President Donald Trump in his (now sadly ignored) major foreign policy speeches in Saudi Arabia and Poland in 2017 and his speeches before the United Nations in 2019 and 2020 . But this is a vision going back to Thomas Jefferson’s campaign to clean up the Barbary pirates and James Monroe’s promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine. Our world is much larger than that of Jefferson or Monroe, but the challenge remains the same. “America First” means putting our interests first, but it cannot mean recourse to the shopworn concept of “isolationism.” Instead, “America First” should mean a clear-headed insistence on pursuing the genuine interests of the American people in both our domestic and foreign policies. It rejects the magical thinking that allows China a free pass on environmental regulation while crippling our economy in pursuit of arbitrary and wrong-headed climate agendas. It rejects promoting an international LGBTQ agenda as a feature of our foreign policy, and, for similar reasons, it rejects presenting Vladimir Putin as an avatar of family values while giving him a free pass to pursue the literal destruction of families in Ukraine. Why should we care about the rising threat to a little country like Estonia? Or, why should we care about the independence of Taiwan or other countries threatened by Russia, China, or Iran? The answers may vary in detail, but the fundamentals remain the same. These hostile countries are united by a desire to reshape the world in their favor by reducing the U.S. to a vulnerable and marginal player — they’ve been quite explicit in their desire to take us down , not just in their respective regions, but globally . We should care because the world today is much too dangerous to go it alone. A century ago we could speak of the “ Two-Ocean Navy ” as a perfect guarantor of our security. But no longer. We once scaled our military to counter two adversaries, today we can scarcely afford to keep up with one. We often talk about how our actions affect the minds of our potential adversaries, and that is important. But it’s also worth reminding ourselves that our friends and potential friends are also watching. Friends, true friends, are worth having. As our mothers once taught us, the only way to have a friend is to be a friend. There’s a schoolyard logic to all of this. We are — and I suspect we would like to be — the big kid that all the little kids look up to. But if we don’t stand up to bullies on their behalf the whole schoolyard will turn against us. We can bemoan the rise of the Chinese threat, or complain about the military deficiencies of the larger NATO countries, but China’s rise and the hollowing out of NATO came at a time when we were eagerly spending our so- called “peace dividend” back in the 1990s under Bill Clinton. If NATO countries decided at the time to draw down their military capabilities, they were in many cases simply following our lead. No one wants a war with China, Russia, or Iran, not in defense of Taiwan, Israel, or even little Estonia. But, at this critical juncture in our history, ensuring peace means standing up, strongly, for ourselves and our friends. For too long, we’ve sent a message of weakness, of a willingness to allow ourselves to be pushed around, a message of “calibrated” half-measures as a response when our service members are killed. As I argued in a previous American Spectator article, we refuse to defend our border, even against an obvious terrorist threat . Reversing this message of weakness means more than acquiring hypersonic missiles or AI-guided drones. Put very crudely, our message to the world should be “mess with the U.S. and you will regret it.” In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain dismissed Hitler’s threat to Czechoslovakia as a “quarrel in a faraway country, between people of whom we know nothing.” He assured the world that, having tossed the Czechs under an armored steamroller, he’d guaranteed “peace for our time.” Winston Churchill was having none of it, saying of Chamberlain, “[y]ou were given a choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor and you will have war.” We now know who saw things more clearly. Sometimes you have to stand strong for peace. Prime Minister Kaja Kallas knows this — even as she’s directly threatened by Putin. We need similar courage in our leaders. Would that we might find it. James H.

"1","I The Hall of the Order of St. Catherine is the most intimate of the five staterooms within the forbidding walls of the Grand Kremlin Palace. Lacking the martial character of the Hall of the Order of St. George, and the gilded ostentation of the Hall of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, the Catherine Hall, formerly the throne room of the Romanov empresses, retains a Rococo charm all its own. Its vaulted ceiling is supported by pilasters adorned with inset slabs of malachite, its walls are studded with rhinestones, and its glistening parquet floor shows off the complex geometric patterns designed by the academician Fedor Solntsev — all decorative features that delicately reflect the light cast by the crystal chandeliers and bronze ceiling lamps suspended above. On the wall and the main doors are inscribed the words За Любовь и Отечество , “For Love and the Fatherland.” Here the visitor is greeted by the acceptable, and deceptive, architectural face of Muscovite absolutism, in which the militarism, the grandiosity, and the heroic scale of the other ceremonial halls are temporarily set aside in favor of more refined sensibilities, making this room a fitting venue for foreign diplomatic receptions. It was in the glittering and harmonious Catherine Hall, on Jan. 14, 1994, that Russian President Boris Yeltsin received his American and Ukrainian counterparts, Bill Clinton and Leonid Kravchuk, on the momentous occasion of the signing of the Trilateral Statement, which laid out the terms by which newly-independent Ukraine would transfer its nuclear arsenal to Russia. President Yeltsin began his remarks in an exultant tone, gratified as he was that the agreement had “put to rest one of the last problems of the Cold War,” thereby cementing “the global regime of non-proliferation.” He then offered the floor to President Clinton, who graciously turned to President Kravchuk. The Ukrainian leader, in a very brief statement, confirmed that “there is no alternative to nuclear disarmament,” and that his country would “take the stable path,” something his nation’s tortuous, even torturous, history had long prevented. Then it was President Clinton’s turn. “This agreement,” he declared, “makes the world safer and each of our countries more secure. I am especially pleased to see the development of progress between Ukraine and Russia. As both President Yeltsin and President Kravchuk said to me separately, it is in Russia’s interest for Ukraine to be stable and strong and it is in Ukraine’s interest for Russia to be stable.” He then pointed to his necktie. “It says carpe diem , seize the day, and you have done exactly that. I am convinced that in times of change, those who survive are those who seize the day. We have all said enough. I think we should go sign the agreements.” The three leaders exchanged letters spelling out each party’s solemn commitments, clasped their hands together, smiled for the cameras, and made their way into an adjacent hall to put pen to paper. Later that evening, Clinton attended a 24-course dinner, including moose lips in a succulent wine sauce, held at Yeltsin’s official dacha. The banquet’s host tentatively raised the possibility of the Russian Federation joining NATO — “Russia has to be the first country to join NATO, then the others from Central and Eastern Europe can come in” — and advanced the notion of “a kind of cartel of the United States, Russia, and Europeans to help to ensure and improve world security.” Clinton’s response was diplomatically non-committal, though he did recognize a growing Russo-American “relationship of trust and confidence” that “could guarantee the countries of Europe a century of peace or more.” At which point the American president, true to form, broke out his tenor saxophone. II The studious cordiality of the Moscow signing ceremony masked the fact that the entire affair had been something of a near-run thing. On the very eve of the summit, Leonid Kravchuk had voiced second thoughts about Ukraine surrendering its nuclear warheads because the Ukrainian people, 92.3 percent of whom had just voted in favor of independence a few years earlier, might object to such powerful weapons being handed over to their former oppressors. During a courtesy stop in Kyiv on the way to Moscow, Clinton had warned his Ukrainian counterpart that a withdrawal from the non-proliferation process would lead to dire consequences for Ukrainian-American relations. Cooperation, on the other hand, would enable Ukraine to become the third leading recipient of American foreign aid after Israel and Egypt. Kravchuk relented immediately. Ukrainian accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was, however, dependent on the security “assurances” (which are different than “guarantees,” according to State Department lawyers) contained in the Budapest Memorandum , which was signed on Dec. 5, 1994. According to that political agreement, the Russian Federation, the United States, and the United Kingdom all agreed to “respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine,” to “refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine,” and to “refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind.” Ukraine, which for centuries had been partitioned, torn asunder, and exploited by neighboring empires, could finally rest easy knowing that its sovereignty and territorial integrity were recognized and backed by international law and binding international instruments. Two decades later, the memorandum would be weighed on the scales of global geopolitics and found wanting, to say the least, but in the meantime Ukraine acted in consummate good faith, committed as it was to follow the “stable path.” Its nuclear weapons stockpile, the third largest in the world at the time, was duly liquidated, and its air force gutted. Eleven Tu-160 strategic bombers and 27 strategic Tu-95 bombers were destroyed, alongside nearly 500 Kh-55 air-launched cruise missiles, and at a Feb. 2, 2001 ceremony held at the Pryluky Air Base in north-central Ukraine, American and Ukrainian defense officials looked on with satisfaction as the last of Ukraine’s strategic bombers, a Tu-160 Blackjack and a Tu-22M Backfire, were comprehensively dismantled using industrial equipment provided by the Raytheon Technical Services Company. It was not just Ukraine’s long-range strike capability that was being systematically eliminated. Over the next decade, NATO also assisted Ukraine in a program described as “strengthening demilitarizing capacity,” which entailed the destruction of 1,000 man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), some 15,000 tons of conventional ammunition (artillery shells, cluster munitions, mortar rounds, and small arms ammunition), and 400,000 small arms and light weapons. During a 2005 visit to the Donetsk State Factory of Chemical Products, then-Senator Barack Obama posed grinning for a photo-op in front of a vast pile of dismantled shells, later announcing that “we can start using our resources to dismantle these arms and create a more peaceful and safe future for the people of Ukraine and for people all around the world.” Ukraine’s “demilitarizing capacity” continued to be “strengthened” in the years to come, as tens of thousands of tons of conventional ammunition and millions of antipersonnel mines were processed by the small arms destruction facility in western Ukraine and the explosive waste incinerator in Donetsk. There would be no need for these instruments of death going forward. After all, Ukraine had taken the peaceful path of stability, and had been granted explicit security guarantees — my apologies, security assurances — by the great powers. Europe was gearing up for a post-Cold War “century of peace or more.” It was time to leave the conflicts of the past behind, let the dead at long last bury their dead, and concentrate on the future. III With all the benefits that hindsight brings, we know that President Leonid Kravchuk’s last-second reservations about the surrender of Ukraine’s nuclear weapons and long-range strike assets were prescient. Nuclear weapons, or at the very least nuclear umbrellas, represent the ultimate guarantors of a nation’s sovereignty and security and are far more effective than any memoranda. Pariah regimes like North Korea and Iran have come to recognize this, as did Muammar Gaddafi , we can assume, upon being captured by the Misrata militia, sodomized with a bayonet, and unceremoniously executed, a fate that he likely would have avoided had he accelerated, rather than eliminated, the Libyan weapons of mass destruction program in 2003. At the time, however, few would have blamed Kyiv for fulfilling the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, or for pursuing a broader policy of demilitarization. The Cold War was over and it was time to reap the peace dividend. Strategic bombers designed to strike NATO targets, and nuclear missiles once aimed at western cities, were entirely surplus to requirements and expensive to maintain. Conventional weapons stockpiles were also dangerous, as was made abundantly and tragically clear by a 2004 depot explosion in Melitopol that killed five people and damaged 1,500 buildings. Sheltered under the aegis of the Budapest Memorandum, Ukrainians could choose butter instead of guns, and focus their efforts on purely domestic considerations, as they emerged bleary-eyed from the darkness of the Soviet era into the blinding light of political pluralism and market economics. The last of the Cold War problems had supposedly been put to rest, and there was even talk of an “end of geopolitics” and an “end of history,” a welcome development in a country that had struggled for so long under the weight of geopolitics and history. Ukraine, known variously as the “breadbasket of Europe” and the “gates of Europe,” straddles what the Poles used to call the dzikie pola , the “wild plain” situated between the forests of Central Europe and the vast Eurasian steppes. Its abundant mineral wealth and fecund black earth — Ukraine ranks fourth globally in terms of the assessed value of its natural resources — provide blessings as well as the infamous “resource curse,” and its position between East and West has made it a transit country par excellence. Edmund Burke notoriously proclaimed that “with respect to us, Poland might be, in fact, considered as a country on the moon,” and Neville Chamberlain even more notoriously described Germany’s invasion of Czechoslovakia as “a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing.” All too many in the West seem to feel the same way about Ukraine, oblivious to the economic and strategic importance of the country, and the untold value of its human capital. In the 20th century, Ukraine became the chief battleground between the Nazis and the Soviets. As a result, Ukrainians suffered more deaths from state-sponsored violence than any other European country during this period. Lenin understood that the Soviet experiment was dependent on a steady stream of Ukrainian wheat and coal, while Stalin conceived of Ukraine as “a real fortress of the USSR.” Timothy Snyder, in his magisterial Bloodlands (2010), described how “purged, starved, collectivized, and terrorized, [Ukraine] fed and defended Soviet Russia and the rest of the Soviet Union,” and how Hitler “dreamed of the endlessly fertile Ukrainian soil, assuming that Germans would extract more from the terrain than the Soviets.” A German military study , released in 1940, determined that Ukraine was “agriculturally and industrially the most valuable part of the Soviet Union,” and Hitler was informed by his civilian planners that “the occupation of Ukraine would liberate us from every economic worry.” Stalin felt likewise, and Ukraine, caught in this geopolitical vice, paid an unfathomable price. Mass graves from Stalin’s purges and Hitler’s massacres are still being unearthed to this day. The end of geopolitics and an era of democratic peace would thus bode extremely well for Ukraine. So too would the end of history. Ukraine’s past, so deep and so remarkable, is a source of justified pride for its people, and as Serhii Plokhy has noted, Historians look to those [medieval] principality-based identities for the origins of the modern East Slavic nations. The Vladimir-Suzdal principality served as forerunner of early modern Muscovy and, eventually, of modern Russia. Belarusian historians look to the Polatsk principality for their roots. And Ukrainian historians study the principality of Galicia-Volhynia to uncover the foundations of Ukrainian nation-building projects. But all those identities ultimately lead back to Kyiv, which gives Ukrainians a singular advantage: they can search for their origins without ever leaving their capital. All roads lead to Kyiv, but those roads invariably bring Russian invaders, filling the historical record not just with triumphs but with painful tragedies: political domination and cultural genocide, Bolshevik revolution and civil war, Soviet collectivization and de-kulakization campaigns, the Holodomor, Stalinist purges, the Executed Renaissance of Ukrainian intellectuals, killing fields and torture chambers, world wars, genocide, millions upon millions of dead, and tens of millions more brutalized. It was this history that Ukrainians hoped had ended with the fall of the Soviet Union. Systematic demilitarization was accompanied by an increasingly westward orientation, evident in the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2014 Revolution of Dignity , as Ukrainians took the advice of the poet, political activist, and victim of the Executed Renaissance Mykola Khvylovy: “Get away from Moscow!” In 1976, the Ukrainian Helsinki Group announced that “We Ukrainians live in Europe,” but attempts to integrate politically with Europe eventually led to an armed confrontation with Russia, first in 2014, and then in 2022, when the purple testament of bleeding war was opened, accompanied, as ever, by swarms of Russian invaders, and by the age-old phenomena of mass graves, pulverized cities, and columns of refugees. Now we see muddy trench warfare reminiscent of the First World War, and aerial bombing campaigns reminiscent of the Second World War. So-called Storm-Z battalions of Russian convict soldiers are thrown into “meat assaults,” in a hellish reprise of the conflicts of the 20th century. The ruined, lunar cityscapes of eastern Ukraine reflect the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and fire-bombed Tokyo and Dresden. Temporarily occupied cities have become epicenters of partisan resistance, while Russians operate torture chambers and fill mass graves throughout the country, as in the days of the Cheka, the NKVD, and the Waffen-SS. Libraries and monasteries burn, museums are looted, and graves are robbed. Ukrainian religious groups are once again ruthlessly persecuted, as in Melitopol, where Russian soldiers have desecrated Protestant churches and tortured pastors and youth leaders like Mark Sergeev, leaving no Protestant or Evangelical churches standing in a place where they once outnumbered Orthodox congregations. The pro-Russian Donetsk militant leader Pavel Gubarev casually admits that “we can’t commit genocide against them all,” so “we will have to re-educate them, create concentration camps, but for this we must win at any cost.” All the savagery of the past is being visited upon the present, plain for all to see. Escape has become a necessity. IV It is Ukraine’s particular misfortune to share a 2,295-kilometer-long border with Russia, where the weight of the past falls just as heavily, and far more oppressively, as was very much in evidence during Tucker Carlson’s recent , much-discussed, but ultimately pointless interview with Vladimir Putin. During the Russian dictator’s interminable neurodivergent history of the Slavic Peoples, viewers were treated to a tedious disquisition on everything from the legendary Varangian chieftain Rurik to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, when “the Poles overplayed and forced Hitler to start World War Two by invading them,” a spurious history lesson that carefully avoided any mention of Ukraine’s distinct history, language, and culture in a cynical attempt to deny the indisputable fact of Ukrainian identity. It was an effort that could only have convinced the most gullible or ideologically poisoned spectators, of which there are, unfortunately, quite a few in our benighted and morally ignorant age. (READ MORE: Utterly Conventional: Thoughts on the Tucker–Putin Interview ) This Muscovite obsession with history has become genuinely pathological. Normally-constituted people acknowledge the past, revere the past, or engage in what the Germans call Vergangenheitsbew ä ltigung , or coping with the past, but they still live in the present and for the future. In the ruins of post-war Germany, Hans Habe rightly observed that “birth and death, pregnancy and sickness, poverty and toil, a room, warmth, copulation — even in the most glorious hours of mankind these remain the symbols of a life that goes on, of hope springing anew.” In Putin’s necrophiliac empire, it is death that reigns supreme. Recall Putin’s remarks on Feb. 7, 2022, directed at the Ukrainian people: “Whether you like it or don’t like it, bear with it, my beauty,” a sinister reference to a song by the Soviet-era punk rock group Red Mold, which features the altogether charming line “Sleeping beauty in a coffin, I crept up and f——- her. Like it, or dislike it, sleep my beauty.” This horrible sickness in the body politic is only partially masked by mottos like “For Love and the Fatherland,” or Russia’s trademark preoccupation with ersatz traditionalism and Orthodoxy, despite it having, oh, let’s see, the highest abortion rates in Europe, a globally-leading divorce rate of 73 percent , a culture of brutal physical and sexual abuse ( dedovshchina ) in the military, and a church attendance rate this last Christmas of roughly 1 percent. But Russia has metro stations and grocery stores, so naturally, Tucker Carlson and his ilk have become positively enamored with Putin’s kleptocratic banana republic. Consider, if you have the stomach for it, the events of the night of Feb. 10, 2024, when an Iranian-manufactured Shahed drone, one of 31 launched by Russians against targets in eastern and southern Ukraine, struck a fuel depo t in the city of Kharkiv, igniting a fire that consumed 3,700 square meters of the residential neighborhood located along Kotelnaya Street in the central Nemyshlyan neighborhood. First responders were able to save 25 houses from destruction, but 15 buildings were lost before the blaze was brought under control. In one of the destroyed homes, rescuers made a harrowing discovery : five members of a family that had perished in its entirety. Grigory Putyatin, husband and father, was found in an interior hallway. It appears that when he lost consciousness, his son, the four-year-old Mikhaylo, left his father’s side and crawled into the kitchen, where he died alone. When firefighters entered the bathroom, they found the remains of Olga Putyatina, Grigory’s wife and a local prosecutor, preserved in a final embrace with the charred bodies of her seven-year-old son Oleksiy and her ten-month-old son Pavlo. I would very much like to know what the legend of Rurik the Varangian chieftain has to do with the deaths of Olga Putyatina and the children she held on to until her last desperate breath. I would like to know what Yaroslav the Wise’s order of succession has to do with the death of Grigory Putyatin, who tried to comfort his son as their lungs filled with smoke, or with the death of Mikhaylo Putyatin, who spent his last moments alone in the inferno that was once his home. Does Russia’s bestial behavior, so brazenly on display that night in Kharkiv, really call out for a long-winded historical explanation, or does it simply require, as the Russian dissident Alexander Nevzorov characterizes it, “a purely zoological explanation”? If history, in the so-called Russian World, constitutes not a source of pride and inspiration but of ressentiment, revanchism, irredentism, and murderous impulses, then surely Ukrainians are right to head in the diametrically opposite direction, westward, away from Moscow, and towards a democratic and freedom-loving future, and the sheer bravery of their struggle should be recognized and rewarded. V Last autumn, at a charity concert organized by our local Ukrainian cultural committee, I heard a particularly stirring rendition of the famous song Oy u luzi chervona kalyna , or “A Red Viburnum in the Meadow,” performed by a Ukrainian opera ensemble. First composed in 1875 by the archaeologist Volodymyr Antonovych and the ethnologist Mykhailo Drahomanov, and then given a more modern treatment by the composer Stepan Charnetskyi in 1914, Oy u luzi was adopted by the Sich Riflemen of the First World War, by members of the Ukrainian People’s Army in 1918, and by patriotic Ukrainians ever since. As the glorious lines resounded in the church hall where the performance was held, I was struck, as I always am, by the rousing song’s third verse, which tells of how: Марширують наші добровольці у кривавий тан, Визволяти братів-українців з московських кайдан. А ми наших братів-українців визволимо, А ми нашу славну Україну, гей-гей, розвеселимо! Marshyruiut nashi dobrovoltsi u kryvavyi tan, Vyzvoliaty brativ- ukraintsiv z Moskovskykh kaidan. A my nashykh brativ-ukraintsiv vyzvolymo, A my nashu slavnu Ukrainu, hei-hei, rozveselymo! Our volunteers are marching in a bloody dance, To free our brother Ukrainians from the Muscovite shackles. We will free our brother-Ukrainians, And hey! Hey! We will bring joy to our glorious Ukraine! On Jan. 14, 1994, Presidents Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton, and Leonid Kravchuk were certain that they had put an end to the Cold War, made the world permanently safer, chosen the path of stability, and paved the way for a century or more of peace in Europe. Yet still, the same bloody dance goes on. Ukrainians have learned from experience how difficult it is to escape the shackles of the past. The task is not, however, impossible. I am reminded of the words of the Albanian Hoxha-era dissident Fatos Lubonja, who once told the Polish journalist Margo Rejmer of the relationship between destiny and determination: What is destiny? The river of events that flows through our lives? Imagine this: life is a river formed of two streams that join together. The first is fate: everything that happens because of God’s will — major forces that are stronger than us. We’re defenseless against them … But there’s also the second stream, which I’ll call determination: all the events on which we have an influence, that we shape by means of our own will. What we want to do, who we want to be. Anyone would want these two streams to form a single current, for blind fate to match our inclinations and desires. I was born in wretched Albania — my God, why not in France? You were born in Poland, why not in Germany? That’s our fate — we can’t escape it, but we can put up resistance. We can refuse to let it rule our lives. The Ukrainian people were fated to contend with the forces of geopolitics and history, but they have shown themselves eminently capable, over the centuries and particularly over the last two years, of resisting and showing a determination against seemingly impossible odds, which outside observers first underestimated and now seem to take for granted. Since that terrible day of Feb. 24, 2022, the Ukrainian military has performed admirably, parrying Russian thrusts towards Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv, reclaiming the territory around Izium and Kherson, disabling a third of the once-vaunted Black Sea Fleet, and restoring the Ukrainian sea corridor so that maritime exports have returned to pre-war levels. But Ukraine’s nemesis still represents the world’s second-largest military, replete with a massive stockpile of Soviet-era armaments that is replenished by a steady stream of drones, artillery shells, and ballistic missiles from Iran and North Korea. The legacy of the American-imposed process of “strengthening demilitarizing capacity” haunts Ukraine, which has desperately sought to ramp up its defense industry to make up for lost time, while accepting aid from international partners who furnish what they can. Efforts on Ukraine’s behalf have not been negligible, as can be seen from commitments made just in recent days and weeks. A coalition of allies led by Latvia is aiming to provide Ukraine with one million drones by Feb. 24 of next year. Denmark has pledged to provide all its available artillery, the Czech Republic has scrounged together some 800,000 155mm and 120mm artillery rounds, Finland has approved its 22nd military aid package, Germany’s last aid package includes self-propelled tracked and wheeled howitzers, 120,000 rounds of artillery, Skynex air defense systems, and missiles for IRIS-T SLS air defense systems. France has signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine, pledging €3 billion of assistance for 2024 and vowing to increase cooperation on artillery-related matters, not long after the United Kingdom signed a similarly “unprecedented security agreement” with the government in Kyiv. Still, the nations of Europe, which strengthened their demilitarizing capacity in the aftermath of the Cold War in reliance on American security guarantees, cannot support Ukrainian efforts on their own, and the effects of congressional dithering and entirely underserved vacations are being felt on the Ukrainian frontlines, where the heroic but ammunition-starved defenders of Avdiivka were deprived of fire support and counter-battery fire. America risks abdicating its status as the sole guarantor of international peace and stability. Ukraine faces a far greater peril even than that. I have precious little time for the reflexively Putin-apologetical “realist” international relations scholar John “Putin rarely lies to foreign audiences” Mearsheimer, but there is a modicum of truth to his 2015 prediction that “the West is leading Ukraine down the primrose path.” Now, it is profoundly offensive to blame the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine on the United States or NATO, as Mearsheimer invariably does, instead of on the obviously Putin regime. Putin himself typically forgets to attribute the war to the potential of NATO expansion, preferring (as he did in the recent Carlson interview) to ramble about the “gathering of the Russian lands” and other such tripe. And bear in mind that in May 2002 Putin even admitted that “Ukraine will not shy away from the processes of expanding interaction with NATO and the Western allies as a whole. Ukraine has its own relations with NATO…At the end of the day, the decision is to be taken by NATO and Ukraine. It is a matter for those two partners.” If Ukraine can be said to have journeyed down the “primrose path,” it was a trip that began in Catherine Hall on Jan. 14, 1994, when it took the “stable path” of disarmament following the Trilateral Statement. Ukraine’s “demilitarizing capacity” was systematically “strengthened” by its newfound allies, who assured its security, but in doing so rendered it vulnerable to its rapacious neighbor. Amidst the ongoing invasion, Ukraine’s defense industry conglomerate Ukroboronprom has valiantly strived to make up for lost time, and allies have provided desperately needed aid, but five months of congressional inaction have taken a toll, the cost of which Ukrainians bear in the currency of blood and land. The immortal words of the Ukrainian poet, ethnographer, and activist Ivan Franko, from his 1897 poem “If,” often come to my mind these days: Якби могучість, щастя і свобода Відмірялись по мірі крові й сліз, Пролитих з серця і з очей народа, – То хто б з тобою супірництво зніс? Yakby mohuchist, shchastia i svoboda Vidmirialys po miri krovi i sliz, Prolytykh z sertsia i z ochei naroda, – To khto b z toboiu supirnytstvo znis? If power, joy, and liberty Were measured by the blood and tears Shed by the people’s hearts and eyes Who could ever rival you? The flow of blood and tears continues, amidst a sanguinary centuries-old dance that has been in full swing for two full years. Three decades ago, Ukrainians nobly chose the path of stability and European integration, and are paying the price for their aspirations, while demonstrating an awe-inspiring determination in the face of a barbarous onslaught. If our own internal strife and limited attention span endanger Ukraine’s achievements, it will not only be to our eternal discredit. The world will consequently be far less safe and secure if all the wrong lessons about non-proliferation are learned, if the value of American security assurances is rendered worthless, and if a nation’s immense sacrifices in the cause of freedom are treated with casual indifference."
"1","Gateway to Statesmanship : Selections from Xenophon to Churchill By John A. Burtka IV (Gateway Editions, 344 pages, $20) The publication of Johnny Burtka’s Gateway to Statesmanship : Selections from Xenophon to Churchill strikes as a most peculiar election-year book. The genre, which in 2024 includes such offerings as White Rural Rage: The Heartland Threat to America ; Find Me the Votes: A Hard-Charging Georgia Prosecutor, a Rogue President, and the Plot to Steal an American Election ; and Amateur Hour: Kamala Harris in the White House , normally consists of hastily written tomes as hastily disposed of after November. Most possess the literary value of a bumper sticker. The motivation to write involves pushing the conversation, and, especially, voters, this way or that way. The genre’s successes generally hype readers already predisposed to head in the direction the author pushes them. Gateway to Statesmanship discusses neither Donald Trump nor Joe Biden and, given the 2,300-year range of the included selections, seems as appropriate reading to prepare for November 2024 as for November 2224 (though one guesses the formats expand beyond paper, digital, and audio to include implantation and mind-meld by that point). Yet, it falls into this election-year book category. And, still, it doesn’t. Burtka characterizes the included readings as part of the “mirror for princes” tradition. This means that the offerings targeted a limited audience, primarily the leadership class, of a time and place. Their inclusion indicates a universal, rather than parochial, quality that enabled the writings to transcend their time and place. The book consists of an author’s introduction more than 50-pages long and selections across cultures and millennia. “They demonstrate concretely that it is possible for great men and women to live with principle in a messy and fallen world,” Burtka writes in the introduction of wise ancient leaders. “When necessary, they prudentially ‘get their hands dirty’ in order to achieve the greater good for their communities. Yet there are limits to their behavior.” Burtka divides the book into that ancient period that includes classical Greece and Rome, Medieval times, the Renaissance, and the Modern era encompassing writings by George Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, and Winston Churchill. “The Renaissance period marked the pinnacle of the mirrors-for- princes tradition in the West,” he explains. “Scholars first rediscovered classic Roman texts like those of Cicero and Seneca, which were scattered across Europe but not widely studied. Then, with the fall of Constantinople, exiles from the East brought Greek texts by the likes of Homer and Thucydides to Italy, helping popularize them for wider audiences. This spurred the publication of new texts that built upon or, in some cases, openly challenged them.” The universality that enables texts to time-travel across the centuries unsurprisingly enables them to journey from continent to continent as well. “The ruler of men too has his bristling scales,” Han Fei pointed out. “Only if a speaker can avoid brushing against them will he have any hope for success.” Five thousand miles and 750 years away in Constantinople, the deacon in the Hagia Sophia Church illustrated the wisdom of the emphasis on the sovereign rather than the citizen. “As on a voyage, when a sailor makes a mistake, he brings little harm to those sailing with him,” Agapetus wrote. “But when the helmsman does so, he brings about the destruction of the whole ship. So too with cities: if a subject errs, he does not so much harm society as himself. But if the ruler does wrong, then he damages the whole state.” The phrase “mirrors for princes” strikes Western readers of 2024 as arcane in the way “the education fit for a king” might. In a monarchy, the sovereign-in-training reading Aristotle’s Nicomachian Ethics and St. Augustine’s City of God seems essential to the continued prosperity of the nation. In a republic, where 335 million instead of one guy rules, the education fit for a king must become the education for the everyman. When liberal education — the instruction fit for a free man — yields to ideological indoctrination and professional training, then the everyman becomes not only not a king but a despot unfit to govern his fellow man or even his own soul. One senses that Burtka, though writing a mirrors-for-princes book, understands this. “Most important,” he writes in emphasizing the salience of such an education, “it’s vital for those with the courage to pursue such an arduous task to understand that this project will only succeed if the teachers, mentors, and pupils involved possess a vision for the flourishing of the whole body politic. The common good—not narrow partisan or class interests—must capture the political imagination and shape the vocabulary of the leaders produced by such an undertaking. Only then, when the totality of the people, laws, culture, and customs are lifted up and transfigured in light of the enduring and ennobling truths from the mirrors- for princes tradition, can the decline, divisions, and decadence of our present moment begin to heal and happiness spread.”"
"1","T o live in America in the third decade of the 21st century is to experience something similar to that which many, particularly those on the right, warned about not long after the turn of the millennium. Following the jihadist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which shook the country to her core, there was a great concern that the waning Christianity in our cities and cultural institutions would open a wide door to the growth of a militant, hostile, imperial Islam. And the response to 9/11, which included two wars, neither of which were won despite not a single lost battle over the course of 20 years of combat, did little to calm those concerns. There’s an awful lot of damage to consider if you look back over those 20 years. But the more I think about our spiritual decline and loss of Judeo-Christian cultural primacy, the less I can help to consider one data point — perhaps among many — that marked an unmistakable break from our tradition as a confident, biblical civilization and has led to this … whatever it is that we now are. I’ll get to that data point in a second. But what brought it to mind is this disgusting little nugget of news : Outagamie County’s human resources director was arrested overnight and is in a southern Wisconsin jail. Jail records from Sauk County show Adam Westbrook was booked at 3:40 a.m. Friday. According to the records, sheriff’s officials are recommending he be charged with four counts of possession of child pornography and four counts of sexual exploitation of a child. No formal charges have been filed in the case. FOX 11 has learned Westbrook was taken into custody in Neenah after multiple agencies, including the Neenah Police Department and the State Department of Justice, executed a search warrant as part of a Kenosha County investigation. The Kenosha County Sheriff’s Office told FOX 11 it won’t be releasing any information about Westbrook’s arrest yet, as it’s part of a much larger investigation where the safety of children is a concern. According to his LinkedIn account, Westbrook started working for Outagamie County in September of 2023. He worked in a similar capacity for the City of Sheboygan and City of Oshkosh in 2022 and 2023, staying in each position for less than a year. Before working in human resources, he was the city attorney in Neenah. Why would we care much about a local news story, however despicable, in the context of our societal evolution? Because it turns out that Adam Westbrook isn’t so much a nondescript public-sector employee with a perversion for kiddie porn; he’s a member of the local Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence anti-Catholic drag queen troupe: BREAKING: Anti-Catholic Drag Queen Adam Westbrook was arrested and is facing four counts of possession of child p*rn and four counts of sexual exploitation of a child. Adam was also the human resources director for Outagamie County, WI and is pictured in drag with the Mayor of… pic.twitter.com/XauXfKwc14 — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) February 18, 2024 It’s a sick society that gives government jobs to pedophiles and open blasphemers. If you despair that America isn’t lost just as a post-Christian civilization but as a burgeoning anti-Christian one, too, you might be guilty of overdramatizing the situation, but you certainly aren’t wrong to have the concern. What’s more, you probably saw a lot of this coming. One warning sign of it came from overseas. As you know, American troops spent two decades in Afghanistan and left without making much of a dent in the barbaric and perverted practice of bacha bazi — the use of young boys as sexual playthings by mature men. So complete was our complicity in sanctioning that practice as it had been “enjoyed” by the locals in many an Afghan village that there are today quite a number of American soldiers wasting away in prison for using force in an effort to stop it and other iterations of child molestation in that benighted country. And an even larger number of soldiers who were drummed out of the Army. One of those who managed to save his career was a Green Beret, Sgt. 1st Class Charles Martland , who had to endure a months-long fight and solicit the help of U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter in order to ward off a dishonorable discharge: Martland has admitted that he and a supervisor were “absolutely wrong” to hit the Afghan Local Police commander while deployed in Kunduz Province. But he said they were moved to act after the commander kidnapped and raped a local boy, and beat the boy’s mother for seeking the Americans’ help. “We already had two other ALP commanders receive no punishment from the Afghan government for the rape of a 15-year-old girl and the honor killing of a commander’s 12-year-old daughter for kissing a boy,” Martland wrote in a January 2015 memo that Hunter’s office provided to NBC News. “My Detachment Commander and I felt that morally we could no longer stand by and allow our ALP to commit atrocities.” Martland and his supervisor, Capt. Dan Quinn, were pulled from Afghanistan. Quinn left the military, while Martland fought his punishment. He eventually turned to Hunter, a former Marine, who fought Martland’s removal and drafted a bill that would allow U.S. troops to confront sexual abuse. And yet when our Taliban enemies recaptured the country, they made a concerted effort to stamp out bacha bazi and punish the rampant pedophilia in that society. The lack of will to impose even the most basic of our values — protecting young boys from sexual slavery — on a culture that had harbored the people who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks stands as one of the most crucial inflection points in our spiritual decline. And now it appears that the American version of bacha bazi features adult men attempting to dress up as whores while grooming and molesting children. It’s hard to say this is any better. A confident Christian America would have insisted on eradicating bacha bazi , just as a confident Christian Great Britain eradicated the similarly barbaric practice of sati , or the burning of widows on the funeral pyres of their husbands. A famous story of Gen. Sir Charles James Napier, at the time the commander of British troops in India, outlined what such a response would look like. Told of the practice and given the excuse that sati was a long-standing custom among the Indians, Napier laid down the law , as one would expect of a commander secure in the belief his society was superior morally as well as militarily: Be it so. This burning of widows is your custom; prepare the funeral pile. But my nation has also a custom. When men burn women alive we hang them, and confiscate all their property. My carpenters shall therefore erect gibbets on which to hang all concerned when the widow is consumed. Let us all act according to national customs. The United States spent two decades in Afghanistan, and one reason our puppet regime could not hold power there when our troops finally pulled out was a local public disgusted with what it saw as the moral rot America had brought and allowed while occupying the country. The fear was that Islam would rush in to replace a waning Christianity in America, as it has done to an extent in a disintegrating Europe. That didn’t materialize. What did was worse. Wokeness — and the perversity it celebrates and elevates according to the principles of intersectionality — is worse. America is in palpable decline concurrent with the decline of Christianity in our culture. What has replaced the values of Christianity is not a vibrant, enlightened, and scientific secular liberalism. It’s arguable whether such a thing exists or is even possible. So we might just find that the barbarism of bacha bazi could outlive our status as a Christian nation — and if it doesn’t, we’ll have the Taliban, and not the two decades and $4 trillion spent in Afghanistan, to thank for that. And worse, we might just find that while failing to stamp out that disgusting practice in Afghanistan, we’re made to surrender to a version of it here at home."
"2","Seventeen years ago, the British novelist John Lanchester puzzled over a “strange and striking” fact: No one was blowing anything up to fight climate change . This was strange, Lanchester wrote , because “terrorism is for the individual by far the modern world’s most effective form of political action.” What’s more, there was no shortage of soft targets for an anti-carbon terror cell to attack. Gas stations were highly flammable. SUVs, ripe to be keyed, sat unguarded along every city’s streets. So why was no one engaging in such property destruction? Why did activists remain committed to pacifism, even as the world hurtled toward catastrophe? Perhaps, Lanchester mused, “even the people who feel most strongly about climate change on some level can’t quite bring themselves to believe in it.” The concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere is now nearly 10 percent higher than when Lanchester wrote those words. In 2007, limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels remained plausible. Today, it is not . The absence of violent resistance to carbon power might therefore seem even more curious in 2024 than it was when Lanchester wrote his essay. Still, there are ways of resolving the apparent tension between the severity of the climate crisis and the absence of ecoterrorism. One is to question whether terrorism is, in fact, “the modern world’s most effective form of political action.” Another is for climate activists to start detonating pipelines. Andreas Malm recommends the latter. In 2021, the Swedish academic published a case for climate activists to embrace property destruction titled How to Blow Up a Pipeline (aspiring bombers will be disappointed by the volume’s lack of step- by-step instructions). The book was a surprise bestseller. Mainstream media does not typically shower coverage on calls for violent resistance penned by Swedish Leninists . But given the perennial failure of ordinary politics to answer the demands of climate science, the liberal intelligentsia was ready to hear Malm out. His book won respectful notices in the New York Times , the New Yorker , and the Economist , among other publications, and even generated a much-acclaimed cinematic adaptation . Malm and his ideas received a new wave of scrutiny last month, after David Marchese of the New York Times Magazine conducted an adversarial Q&A; with the author and activist. Marchese suggested that socialists who endorse left-wing political violence but condemn the far right’s attempts to override democratic decision-making through similar shows of force are moral hypocrites. Malm disagreed. Much debate over the permissibility of blowing up pipelines ensued. Yet Malm’s true failing is not hypocrisy, but dogmatism. And the fundamental problem with How to Blow Up a Pipeline isn’t its radical prescriptions, but rather, its doctrinaire diagnosis of the social crisis that it aims to cure. In that book, Malm makes some plausible arguments for the efficacy and morality of property destruction in some contexts. But he also paints a deeply misleading portrait of the climate crisis, one that is oblivious to many of the most vexing economic, technical, and political obstacles to rapid decarbonization. Unable or unwilling to see these barriers, Malm fails to articulate a persuasive vision for how they can be overcome in his book (and declined an interview request). Instead, he evangelizes for a course of action that would (almost certainly) undermine the climate movement’s political standing while doing little to contain global temperatures. Malm’s argument, in brief The perils of climate change are increasingly vivid. Wildfires , floods , and heat waves regularly take lives and make headlines. Last year was the hottest in recorded history . With each passing day, our prospects for preventing global temperatures from exceeding the red lines set by scientists grow more remote. Yet fossil fuels continue to dominate the world’s energy grids. This disconnect between ecological necessity and economic reality is central to How to Blow Up a Pipeline . Its case for property destruction rests on the demonstrable failure of nonviolent resistance to bring about the fossil fuel industry’s demise. Malm argues that the climate movement has been scrupulously honoring Gandhian principles for decades; disrupting global economic forums, marching through city streets, and appealing to the better angels of policymakers’ nature. And none of it stopped our species’ headlong sprint toward ecological collapse. Even if we stopped building new fossil fuel plants tomorrow, Malm writes, the lifetime emissions of existing power plants would be enough to lift global temperatures more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Yet capitalists are blithely financing new coal and gas infrastructure that will only pay off if the world’s nations blow past their emissions targets. In Malm’s words, “these capitalists do not see any wrecking balls coming their way. They think they have nothing to fear.” And make no mistake: For Malm, it’s the capitalist class that is (more or less single-handedly) frog-marching us all to hell. How to Blow Up a Pipeline acknowledges no technical obstacles to rapid decarbonization, nor any regrettable economic trade-offs. Rather, it suggests that an immediate green transition would be relatively painless for ordinary people. Renewable energy is now “consistently cheaper” than the carbon variety, Malm writes. For this reason, the world’s poor and working classes have no compelling interest in even the near-term use of fossil fuels. Malm insists that “all emissions must be brought to zero in no time,” but that such radical measures will “not condemn the poor to eternal poverty, for what they need is not emissions but energy, and with the renewable kind cheaper across the board, the transition does not require the sacrifice of their material aspirations.” With few technical challenges left to resolve, and no lamentable economic downsides to a swift green transition, victory, in Malm’s view, would seem close at hand — were it not for the greed of the ruling class. The wealthy, he suggests, would rather drown every coastal city than take losses on stranded fossil fuel assets. And since the world’s governments deem capitalist property “sacred,” they’re unwilling to prioritize humanity’s future over Shell’s profits. Climate activists can liberate governments from their ruinous deference to capital, but only if their movement forsakes its sentimental commitment to nonviolence. This is where blowing up a pipeline comes in. By sabotaging fossil fuel infrastructure, militants can demonstrate, he says, that “Property does not stand above the earth.” With each “refinery deprived of electricity” or “digger in pieces,” the idea of stranding fossil fuel assets will grow more politically thinkable. And militants can do this without doing bodily harm to a single soul. Property destruction, he argues, can also change the calculus of capitalists themselves. Much fossil fuel infrastructure is highly vulnerable to sabotage. Pipelines traverse long stretches of thinly populated territory and become inoperable if even a single segment is destroyed. If pipelines became subject to routine attacks, they would cease to be attractive investments. Capitalists might not be sensitive to climate risks, but they are highly responsive to financial ones. At the same time, the emergence of a violent, militant wing of the climate movement will make the demands of more mainstream green groups appear more reasonable. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Malm argues, violent resistance helpfully supplemented many of history’s most successful, supposedly nonviolent movements. A pipeline cannot suffer. But poor people in frontline communities can. In Malm’s view, we should not hesitate to do violence to the former to stop CO2 emissions from devastating the latter. Why soaking the rich won’t cleanse the atmosphere If Malm were right, and the ruling class’s power and avarice were the overriding obstacles to a green transition, then the outlook for both ecosocialism and the climate might seem bright. In that circumstance, radicals like Malm would have a decent chance of mobilizing a mass base behind their agenda, which includes an immediate ban on all new C02-emitting devices. Attacks on fossil fuel infrastructure, meanwhile, would be liable to provoke considerable public sympathy, since most people would have no interest in the ongoing production of oil and gas. But the ideological convenience of Malm’s narrative comes at the expense of its accuracy. It is true that rich people in general, and fossil fuel shareholders in particular, wield disproportionate political influence. And in the United States, this influence has long undermined efforts to decarbonize the economy . The fossil fuel sector’s clout has kept the Republican Party from fighting for climate policy of virtually any kind, while constraining the Democrats’ environmental ambitions. Although the political power of Big Oil is an obstacle to decarbonization, it is far from the only one. And the same can be said of How to Blow Up a Pipeline’s other main target, the carbon-intensive consumption of the super-rich. If every fossil fuel lobby shuttered its doors tomorrow, and all billionaires forfeited their yachts and jets, the climate crisis would persist. This is because How to Blow Up a Pipeline’s narrative is at odds with some basic facts about the climate crisis. Decarbonizing at Malm’s preferred pace would require technologies that do not yet exist and economic sacrifices that few wish to make. And those sacrifices would not just burden rich people in the West, but also working people in the Global South. Malm is right that, by many metrics, renewable energy is now cheaper than carbon power. Yet wind and solar power remain highly variable, generating more energy than needed during certain times of day and meteorological conditions, and little in others. This liability can be mitigated by massively overbuilding wind and solar assets in geographically diverse regions, and connecting them all to the grid through transmission lines. But such overbuilding could eliminate renewables’ apparent cost advantage and would require large quantities of land. Advances in battery technology may eventually resolve the intermittency problem. But for now, renewable-heavy electricity grids need to be undergirded by firm (i.e., non- intermittent) power sources. There are some carbon-free sources of firm power, such as nuclear and geothermal energy. But the former has high upfront costs, and the latter is not currently accessible in most areas. In practice, this means that even climate-conscious jurisdictions generally need fossil fuels to avert blackouts when the sun hides and wind grows still. Meanwhile, carbon- free approaches to aviation and heavy industry remain far from commercial viability. The global economy’s persistent demand for fossil fuels derives less from the machinations of nihilistic capitalists than from the genuine difficulties of decarbonization. For this reason, it is not just private investors who are bankrolling new fossil fuel infrastructure, but also developmental states in the Global South. Malm’s book suggests that the energy policies of middle-income countries, and the rising living standards of their people, play only a marginal role in the climate crisis. “Look at it which way you will,” Malm writes, “from the angle of investment, production or consumption, it is the rich that drive the emergency[.]” But the truth is far more complicated. Last year, the world’s annual CO2 emissions increased by 398 million metric tons. China and India accounted for more than 100 percent of that increase. Take those two nations out of the equation, and global emissions would have fallen in 2023. These trends are poised to continue in the coming decades. According to the International Energy Agency, as much as 80 percent of the global growth in demand for electricity between now and 2030 is likely to come from emerging markets and developing economies. None of this says anything about moral responsibility for the climate crisis. The cumulative emissions of Western nations wildly outstrip those of Asia. And the per-capita emissions of an American billionaire vastly exceed those of a middle-class Chinese household. But the atmosphere does not care about moral responsibility. Through sheer force of numbers, the Indian and Chinese people emit more carbon than American billionaires. Any political strategy for achieving decarbonization must therefore have an answer for how the Global South can industrialize sustainably. Malm’s assurance that renewables “are cheaper across the board” does not qualify. Due to wind and solar’s intermittency problem, and the high upfront costs of renewable infrastructure, it is often more economical for developing countries to rely heavily on carbon power, according to an analysis from the World Bank. To be fair to Malm, global capitalists are implicated in that problem. Lenders generally demand higher interest rates when financing renewable projects in developing countries than they do when bankrolling such infrastructure in wealthy nations. These elevated borrowing costs make it even harder for low-income nations to shoulder the large infrastructure expenses that low-carbon grids require. Still, the economic incentives for carbon development persist, even when states take the reins from private investors. Take China: Following widespread blackouts in 2021, the Chinese Communist Party has made a concerted effort to increase its nation’s reserves of electricity. Theoretically, it could have done this largely through the expansion of renewables. But China’s wind and solar installations are concentrated in the nation’s sunny, windy northwestern regions, far from population centers, and would have required the construction of massive transmission lines to transport power to cities. So it was much cheaper and easier for the Chinese state to rapidly scale up electricity production by building new coal plants. Greening the global economy isn’t much like overthrowing apartheid None of this is meant to exonerate jet-setting plutocrats and fossil fuel lobbyists, or to deny capitalism’s structural defects. Wealthy countries should reduce the CO2 emissions of both their superrich citizens (by redistributing much of their wealth and income) and affluent households (by, among other things, expanding mass transit and urban housing). And such nations should also cease subsidizing oil companies, and increase public investment in clean energy . Nevertheless, contrary to Malm’s populist rhetoric, the carbon economy’s persistence cannot be chalked up to the greed of wealthy shareholders, decadence of yacht owners, or corruption of democratic states. In reality, switching out the energy basis of industrial society is a genuinely difficult technical challenge. Abruptly phasing out fossil fuels and carbon-emitting devices would have significant economic costs for ordinary people. Malm’s blindness to these facts impairs his political analysis. At one point in How to Blow Up a Pipeline , the author mulls the mystery of why people in the Global South haven’t been sabotaging fossil fuel infrastructure. He decides that it must be due to “the demise of revolutionary politics” and “insufficient politicisation of the climate crisis.” The possibility that people in developing countries want to keep the lights on in their homes, and are therefore uninterested in breaking their nations’ energy infrastructure, goes unconsidered. Which is odd, since many low-income nations are unabashed in their enthusiasm for new fossil fuel pipelines. Indeed, such enthusiasm has driven one of this decade’s biggest conflicts in global energy politics: Wealthy states in the Global North have been choking off financing to fossil fuel projects in the developing world, a policy that has generated furious protest from poor countries, which tend to be more concerned with mitigating their extreme poverty than minimizing their emissions. Malm is similarly inattentive to the climate movement’s political challenges in the Global North. In making his case for the legitimacy and efficacy of property destruction, he notes that many of history’s most lauded social movements have featured violence at their fringes. He argues that the Black Power movement served to make Martin Luther King Jr.’s demands appear more reasonable. And he observes that the African National Congress had no compunction about deploying political violence in South Africa when it seemed strategically helpful, while violent insurrections abetted India’s independence. Malm posits that one reason why the struggles against Jim Crow, South African apartheid, and British rule in India succeeded — while the West’s climate movement has thus far failed — is that the former all availed themselves of violence while the latter has largely forsworn it. He acknowledges that Western environmentalists made forays into sabotage in the 1990s , and that these experiments yielded far more state repression than tangible progress. But he attributes such failures to both the unpopularity of the saboteurs’ goals (which included a large reduction in the human population), and the imprecision of their targets. Malm is sensitive to the threat of backlash, and chastises activist group Extinction Rebellion for attempting to shut down the London Underground in 2019 . In his view, inconveniencing ordinary people who are trying to use a low-carbon form of transit advances nothing but the climate movement’s own marginalization. If activists directly target “the plinth of fossil capital,” however, he believes they are more likely to win some public sympathy, and less likely to undermine their more respectable allies. Yet a commitment to nonviolence is scarcely the only thing that distinguishes the climate movement from all of the auspicious precedents that Malm cites. In many respects, climate radicals simply face a much more difficult challenge than did the celebrated social movements that they wish to emulate. The struggles against Jim Crow, apartheid, and British colonialism consisted of mass movements to secure basic rights. The injustice and indignities of apartheid structured Black South Africans’ daily lives, constraining their economic opportunities and denying their political freedoms. And the same can be said of Jim Crow’s implications for Black Americans . By contrast, the typical Westerner does not find their basic aspirations frustrated by climate change on anything like a daily basis. Extreme weather events periodically call the problem to mind, but even then it is not always clear that rising global temperatures are responsible for a specific flood or fire. Further, the anti-apartheid and civil rights movements could plausibly promise to redress their animating grievances, and without the advent of any new technology or cooperation of any foreign power. No technical challenge stood in the way of universal voting rights . Formal political equality could be established with the stroke of pen and enforced by existing institutions of federal law enforcement. The climate movement, on the other hand, cannot credibly promise to eliminate the problems that it seeks to politicize. The world is going to get warmer, no matter how much we reduce emissions from this point forward. In any given rich country, climate activists can’t honestly say that their agenda will improve climatic conditions, only that it might limit the extent to which those conditions get worse, assuming that other nations enact similar policies. Malm’s radical vision of decarbonization pairs this meager, uncertain prize with clear and immediate economic costs: Any near-term ban on fossil fuels would dramatically increase energy prices, and undermine the functioning of electricity grids. It is not surprising, then, that Malm’s cause commands far less widespread and intense support among contemporary Westerners than the anti-apartheid struggle did among Black South Africans or the civil rights movement among Black Americans. In fact, at least in the United States, polling and election results indicate scant public support for decarbonization efforts that entail any significant material costs. Last year, an Ipsos poll asked Americans whether they would be willing to pay higher income taxes to combat climate change. Just 25 percent of respondents said yes. That comports with a 2019 Reuters survey , which found that nearly 70 percent of Americans backed “aggressive” action on climate change — but only one-third would be willing to pay $100 more in annual taxes to address the crisis. Issue polling can be unreliable. Different question phrasings can generate contradictory results. But the idea that Americans are unwilling to shoulder substantial costs for the sake of reducing emissions is buttressed by the electorate’s political behavior. In deep blue Washington, voters have repeatedly rejected a carbon tax at the ballot box, even when that levy was offset by tax breaks for working-class households. The fact that roughly half of US voters are open to supporting the Republican Party, despite its unabashed complacency about carbon emissions, further testifies to climate change’s limited political salience. Perhaps most tellingly, even some climate activists routinely refuse to prioritize decarbonization over conflicting ideological commitments. In recent years, Maine’s Sierra Club fought to block a transmission line that would have enabled Americans to avail themselves of Canadian hydropower, New York environmentalists increased their state’s carbon emissions by shuttering the Indian Point nuclear plant, and a chapter of the Sunrise Movement backed a moratorium on large-scale solar farms in Amherst, Massachusetts. There is little reason to believe that climate radicals’ failure to deliver decarbonization derives from the pacifism of their tactics, rather than the complexity and unpopularity of their demands, and consequent narrowness of their social base. All this undermines Malm’s pragmatic case for pipeline destruction. Acts of violence conducted in the name of goals that the public opposes seem more likely to induce backlash than a leftward lurch in political consciousness. To be sure, acts of sabotage don’t need to be popular to cost fossil fuel investors money. But to meaningfully deter investment in fossil fuel infrastructure, radicals would need to commit sabotage at an extraordinary scale. This is an inherently difficult feat, which public backlash and state repression would make even more daunting. How to decarbonize the economy (without blowing up a pipeline) Ultimately, Malm’s account of the climate crisis is at once too rosy and too bleak. On the one hand, he makes the task facing climate activists look deceptively simple by suggesting that there is only one fundamental problem to be solved: Governments must be forced to subordinate the financial interests of the wealthy to the well-being of humanity. But the actual challenge facing proponents of decarbonization is much more complex and multifaceted. On the other hand, Malm exaggerates the political power of fossil fuel interests. Yes, governments haven’t found the will to put oil companies out of business by fiat (partly because doing so would increase energy costs for the broader public). But they have allowed market forces to strand all manner of carbon assets, in defiance of industry complaints. Competition from renewables and natural gas , combined with new EPA rules , devastated America’s coal industry over the past decade. By 2026, the US is expected to have only half as much coal power generation as it did in 2011. If we can solve the technical and economic liabilities of non-carbon energy sources — which is to say, if we can make them truly “cheaper across the board” — we can euthanize the fossil fuel industry. Doing this will require a great deal of political agitation and policy action. We need to increase public investment in green technologies, slash regulatory barriers to clean energy deployment, provide generous aid and financing to green development projects in the Global South, and solve myriad other problems, all without imposing large costs on electorates, lest support for (relatively) climate-conscious political parties disintegrates. Reasonable people can disagree about which political tactics will best advance these goals. But when self-styled climate hawks privilege ideologically flattering dogmas over inconvenient truths, they make progress on all these fronts more difficult. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","If you pay for car insurance, you’ve probably noticed that rates are really high lately. You’re not alone. Last week’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report — the government’s method for tracking what people are paying for goods and services and how that’s changing over time — noted that the price of car insurance was up more than 20 percent over the same time last year. What’s particularly painful is that rates were already rising: CPI reports have shown that, overall, car insurance rates are up more than 38 percent since January 2020. What’s going on? The big insurance companies have been relatively quiet about what’s driving rates up. Inflation is definitely a big part of the equation. Everything now costs more, including cars and car repairs, and insurance companies are passing those costs on to consumers. But industry insiders and experts I spoke with say there are a few under-the-radar trends also driving rates up, and they relate to the subjects I cover at Vox, so let’s dive in. We’re driving more dangerously One reason rates are up is that driving became much more dangerous during the pandemic. People started engaging in risky behaviors like speeding and using their phones while driving more. vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Subscribe “Since Covid, we saw this incredible increase in distracted driving,” says Ryan McMahon, senior vice president of strategy for Cambridge Mobile Telematics. “You could almost track it by the day schools started to shut down.” He’s not just speculating: CMT has access to driver data for millions of drivers, who download apps via their insurance companies that measure things like speeding, hard braking, and cellphone use while driving. McMahon told me that the huge jump they saw in distracted behaviors during the pandemic hasn’t come down since. Maybe not surprisingly, the number of fatal accidents spiked ; so did the severity of auto insurance claims, meaning cars came in severely damaged and requiring expensive repairs. Costs keep rising While drivers were getting more dangerous, law enforcement in many parts of the country began pulling back on traffic safety enforcement , likely due to Covid-related staff shortages and criticisms over racial biases following the murder of George Floyd. Traffic enforcement has always been a deeply imperfect mode of safety enforcement, one that leaves Black drivers susceptible to racial biases from law enforcement. But it’s also one of the factors insurance companies use to determine individual rates. “Ultimately, without traffic violation data, insurers aren’t able to accurately assess and underwrite a driver’s risk. With the compounding cost from accidents, carriers are now increasing rates for everyone, meaning we are all paying for this problem,” Mark McElroy, executive vice president and head of TransUnion’s insurance business, said in a recent report . Cars have also become more technologically advanced, making car repair more expensive. Think of a car made in 2004 versus a car made in 2024. If the two crashed, the car from 2024 would probably be more expensive to fix because it’s more likely to have advanced technology like backup cameras and lane sensors. According to one report by industry analysts CCC , the average estimate for a front-end claim in 2022 was $3,706, up more than 15 percent over the year before. Vehicles more than seven years old, meanwhile, were over $1,000 less to repair. When does it end? This is, needless to say, not good news for consumers. The price of new cars has grown so much that they’re practically unaffordable for middle-class consumers now, and these rising costs hit low-income people even harder. It’s particularly difficult because for many, a car is often an essential means of keeping a good job. So they’re stuck with a kind of Catch-22: They can’t live with the rising costs of car ownership, but they can’t live without them, either . And their rates are already likely to be higher if they have poor credit or live in a high-crime neighborhood. “The people least able to afford it are paying the highest amount,” said the industry insider. The good news — if you can call it that — is that experts don’t think rates will keep growing so much over the next year. “You had this problem where the insurance companies fell behind, so the prices didn’t match the costs and they were losing a bunch of money,” another insider told me. Rates rose in an attempt by insurance companies to catch up with costs, but now inflation isn’t growing at the same runaway clip and insurers aren’t seeing the same levels of loss. “Costs shouldn’t be as high as last year,” he said.

"2","Everyone’s talking about polyamory. You might have read about it, at least if you pay attention to the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , the New Yorker , the Washington Post , the Atlantic , or New York magazine , or if you listen to podcasts like Esther Perel’s Where Should We Begin? and The Ezra Klein Show . Maybe you’ve seen versions of polyamory plots on TV, like Succession’s Shiv Roy and Tom Wambsgans’s shaky open marriage or the Riverdale finale’s reveal that its four main characters spend their senior year in a quad . Perhaps you’ve noticed that, in many of these cases, the news peg is the release of Molly Roden Winter’s new memoir, More , an account of the writer’s 10 years in an open marriage. Sign up for the Vox Culture newslett er Each week we’ll send you the very best from the Vox Culture team, plus a special internet culture edition by Rebecca Jennings on Wednesdays. Sign up here . Why this one account of polyamory — the practice of having consensual romantic or sexual relationships with multiple people — went so viral is anyone’s guess: It’s not as if people haven’t written memoirs about nonmonogamy before, and the reviews so far have been mixed. While many praise her perspective as a mother pushing back against stereotypes about who gets to have the sex they want and who doesn’t, much of the criticism has revolved around Winter’s privilege, some of which feels fair (that she seemed to lack empathy for the younger, less wealthy secondary partners involved in her marriage) and some less so (the fact that she’s a homeowner in a fancy part of America’s biggest city is obviously a main reason major media outlets are talking about her book, but it’s not as if she’s claiming a universal experience). Yet the current discursive fever pitch on polyamory isn’t just about Winter’s memoir. It’s also not just about polyamory, a practice that has existed for millennia , though mainstream interest in it has spiked from time to time. Christopher Gleason, historian and author of the new book American Poly , explains that in the ’80s and ’90s, poly activists attempted to destigmatize the practice by contextualizing it within Reagan-era moral standards. But this moment, he says, feels bigger than any we’ve had so far: “Americans in general, we’re rethinking intimate relationships on a much deeper level.” Consider the data: There’s currently a record-high share of 40-year-old Americans who’ve never been married (25 percent, as of 2021, an increase from 20 percent in 2010 and six percent in 1980), and according to a Pew Center study last year, only 23 percent of Americans see marriage as essential for living a fulfilling life. More than half of single Americans say they aren’t looking for a relationship or even casual dates, largely because they enjoy singlehood or have more pressing priorities. The birth rate has been steadily falling since the Great Recession, which the Brookings Institution argues stems from “ shifting priorities ” rather than political or economic changes. Young people are having sex later; from 1991 to 2015, a CDC survey found that the percentage of high schoolers who’d had intercourse dropped from 54 percent to 41 percent. The reasons people are having less sex, according to the viral “sex recession” Atlantic feature from 2018, range from smartphone access, surveillance culture, gamified online dating, and improved awareness of boundaries and gender politics. In other words, it’s likely a variety of cultural shifts that explain these changes rather than a single silver bullet. Americans’ attitudes toward monogamy have evolved in tandem: More than one in five single folks have engaged in some form of consensual nonmonogamy, nearly one-third of people in monogamous relationships say their favorite sexual fantasy involves some kind of open relationship, and 51 percent of adults under 30 say that open marriages are acceptable. Openly queer people, who tend to be more likely to approve of different forms of polyamory, now make up a larger percentage of the population, with 17 percent of adults under 30 identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Anyone who’s used a dating app has likely confronted the choice to list oneself as “ethically nonmonogamous,” and with the mainstreaming of apps like Feeld , which are specifically geared toward kink, threesomes, and other forms of polyamory, these terms are now part of everyday relationship discourse. The pandemic also may have accelerated this: Around 2021, explains Leanne Yau, polyamory educator and founder of the blog Poly Philia , “People came out of a very profound period of isolation, and it led to a lot of people reconsidering the decisions they made and perhaps wanting to explore something different.” In response, the pro-marriage cohort is getting louder. They cite studies that show married people are happier and wealthier , and are more likely to raise happy children. New York Times columnist David Brooks last year advised young people to “obsess less about your career and to think a lot more about marriage.” Economist Melissa Kearney’s recent book argues that the falling marriage rate is to blame for rising inequality . In the face of greater political polarization between the sexes (young women are increasingly likely to be liberal, young men conservative), a recent Washington Post op-ed suggested that “ someone will need to compromise” if they ever hope to marry. (Left unasked was why, say, a woman in a post- Roe world would ever want to date someone who did not think she deserved autonomy over her own body.) Loudest among them is University of Virginia sociologist Brad Wilcox’s book Get Married: Why Americans Must Defy the Elites, Forge Strong Families, and Save Civilization, which claims that liberal thought leaders’ denial of the importance of marriage amounts to “an unusual form of hypocrisy that, however well intended, contributes to American inequality, increases misery, and borders on the immoral.” And those are just the fancy people with book deals and newspaper columns. All over the internet, regular folks are freaking out about marriage, sexuality, and gender, too: You’ve likely heard of tradwives, or women who make public performances of their adherence to old-fashioned gender norms — some of whom do so while selling overpriced cookware and downplaying their connections to billionaires . Maybe you’ve seen men proudly claim to eschew masturbation because they believe that semen retention holds the key to one’s true masculine energy. (Heard of the Liver King ? If not, don’t Google it.) One of the most popular influencers among teenage boys is a proud misogynist who speaks frequently about his disrespect for women’s autonomy (and is currently awaiting trial for rape and human trafficking). Conservative talking heads moan about “ blue hair and pronouns ” while TikTok “experts” encourage women to date exclusively for money in a kind of depressing, warped version of feminism where the only thing a man might have to offer a woman is financial security and designer purses. All of these phenomena are responses to changing sexual norms and declining marriage rates. As is, I’d argue, the reason why polyamory is striking such a chord right now: People panic when they’ve been confronted with their own freedom. “It can be very comforting to go on a set path: be exclusive, get married, and have kids,” explains Yau. “Knowing that there are options outside of that can be a really terrifying prospect for people who might never have questioned this kind of thing in their lives.” “I think [people] are really nervous that it’s contagious” It is, naturally, quite difficult to have frank discussions about marriage and monogamy. There are feelings and money and families involved, and the idea of infidelity in particular is uncomfortable and emotional for many. “A lot of people have trauma around that, and seeing people enthusiastically embrace having [multiple partners] and openly practicing something they see as a betrayal of trust is a fundamentally destabilizing experience for them, even though the point of polyamory is that everyone is open and consenting,” says Yau. “I think [people] are really nervous that it’s contagious,” adds Jessica Fern, author of two popular books about navigating attachment and nonmonogamy, Polysecure and Polywise . “There’s a real fear, that, ‘If my husband hears that this is an option, he’s gonna want it, and I don’t necessarily want to do that.’” A big portion of society will also tend to view polyamory as something exclusively beneficial to men, which Gleason points out misunderstands polyamory’s roots in American culture. Sexual freedom has always been the end goal for the feminist and queer liberation movements, without which polyamory wouldn’t be a point of discussion at all. For single straight women, it can often feel as though the number of men listing themselves as ethically nonmonogamous on dating apps is an indication that they, as one woman described to Vogue , “use non-monogamy to convey a sense that they are so free-spirited that they simply cannot be pinned down” as a means to avoid any emotional responsibility in relationships. Dating apps, according to pretty much everyone, are “ in their flop era ,” overrun with bots and sneaky paid features designed to get you to fork over money to connect with anyone you’d actually want to date. “There’s a much bigger swath of the population that is experiencing their lives as single, and not just as a ‘phase’ in your 20s. Your long-term reality is a succession of relationships or short-term arrangements, and I think that percentage is probably going to grow,” says Emily Witt, author of Future Sex: A New Kind of Free Love . With more people marrying later and fewer people marrying at all, many of us will be rethinking how we organize our lives. That can be a hugely positive exercise: In The Other Significant Others: Reimagining Life With Friendship at the Center , NPR’s Rhaina Cohen makes the case for handling questions of child care, elder care, and living arrangements not with marriage as the de facto support system but strong platonic relationships. Polyamorists have also contributed to this reimagining: We live in a world “built for the couple,” per Fern, but what would it look like when parental rights, estate planning, or even architecture (why should a house only have one primary bedroom, for instance?) were built for more than just two people in a romantic relationship? “There’s been this deconstruction wave for the last few decades,” says Fern. “Straightness was deconstructed, and then gender’s been deconstructed. And now it’s monogamy’s turn.” While the prospect of a life outside monogamy and marriage might threaten peoples’ images of the lives they imagined they’d have, it could also allow people the freedom to create something potentially even more meaningful. “We all get really exhausted with internet dating, but I think it’s good to remind ourselves how amazing it is,” says Witt. “You can go have a drink with somebody, and even if they’re not the love of your life, at least you’re meeting people. You’re not doing this on your own, you’re not some social outcast, and there’s like a lot of other people in the same boat.” If the discourse around polyamory is encouraging people to be more honest about their desires, to examine their lives more clearly, and communicate more directly with their current and potential partners, and to question the value of societal expectations, then that feels like a win — even if you don’t have any interest in participating.

"2","If you take it for granted that nobody can listen in on your innermost thoughts, I regret to inform you that your brain may not be private much longer . You may have heard that Elon Musk’s company Neuralink surgically implanted a brain chip in its first human. Dubbed “Telepathy,” the chip uses neurotechnology in a medical context: It aims to read signals from a paralyzed patient’s brain and transmit them to a computer, enabling the patient to control it with just their thoughts. In a medical context, neurotech is subject to federal regulations. But researchers are also creating noninvasive neurotech. Already, there are AI-powered brain decoders that can translate into text the unspoken thoughts swirling through our minds, without the need for surgery — although this tech is not yet on the market. In the meantime, you can buy lots of devices off Amazon right now that would record your brain data (like the Muse headband , which uses EEG sensors to read patterns of activity in your brain, then cues you on how to improve your meditation). Since these aren’t marketed as medical devices, they’re not subject to federal regulations; companies can collect — and sell — your data. With Meta developing a wristband that would read your brainwaves and Apple patenting a future version of AirPods that would scan your brain activity through your ears, we could soon live in a world where companies harvest our neural data just as 23andMe harvests our DNA data. These companies could conceivably build databases with tens of millions of brain scans, which can be used to find out if someone has a disease like epilepsy even when they don’t want that information disclosed — and could one day be used to identify individuals against their will. Luckily, the brain is lawyering up. Neuroscientists , lawyers , and lawmakers have begun to team up to pass legislation that would protect our mental privacy. In the US, the action is so far happening on the state level. The Colorado House passed legislation this month that would amend the state’s privacy law to include the privacy of neural data. It’s the first state to take that step. The bill had impressive bipartisan support, though it could still change before it’s enacted. Minnesota may be next. The state doesn’t have a comprehensive privacy law to amend, but its legislature is considering a standalone bill that would protect mental privacy and slap penalties on companies that violate its prohibitions. But preventing a company from harvesting brain data in one state or country is not that useful if it can just do that elsewhere. The holy grail would be federal — or even global — legislation. So, how do we protect mental privacy worldwide? Your brain needs new rights Rafael Yuste, a Columbia University neuroscientist, started to get freaked out by his own neurotech research a dozen years ago. At his lab, employing a method called optogenetics , he found that he could manipulate the visual perception of mice by using a laser to activate specific neurons in the visual cortex of the brain. When he made certain images artificially appear in their brains, the mice behaved as though the images were real. Yuste discovered he could run them like puppets. He’d created the mouse version of the movie Inception . And mice are mammals, with brains similar to our own. How long, he wondered, until someone tries to do this to humans? In 2017, Yuste gathered around 30 experts to meet at Columbia’s Morningside campus, where they spent days discussing the ethics of neurotech. As Yuste’s mouse experiments showed, it’s not just mental privacy that’s at stake; there’s also the risk of someone using neurotechnology to manipulate our minds. While some brain-computer interfaces only aim to “read” what’s happening in your brain, others also aim to “write” to the brain — that is, to directly change what your neurons are up to. The group of experts, now known as the Morningside Group, published a Nature paper later that year making four policy recommendations, which Yuste later expanded to five. Think of them as new human rights for the age of neurotechnology: 1\. Mental privacy: You should have the right to seclude your brain data so that it’s not stored or sold without your consent. 2\. Personal identity: You should have the right to be protected from alterations to your sense of self that you did not authorize. 3\. Free will: You should retain ultimate control over your decision-making, without unknown manipulation from neurotechnologies. 4\. Fair access to mental augmentation: When it comes to mental enhancement, everyone should enjoy equality of access, so that neurotechnology doesn’t only benefit the rich. 5\. Protection from bias: Neurotechnology algorithms should be designed in ways that do not perpetuate bias against particular groups. But Yuste wasn’t content to just write academic papers about how we need new rights. He wanted to get the rights enshrined in law. “I’m a person of action,” Yuste told me. “It’s not enough to just talk about a problem. You have to do something about it.” Related Elon Musk wants to merge humans with AI. How many brains will be damaged along the way? How do we get neurorights enshrined in law? So Yuste connected with Jared Genser, an international human rights lawyer who has represented clients like the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi. Together, Yuste and Genser created a nonprofit called the Neurorights Foundation to advocate for the cause. They soon notched a major win. In 2021, after Yuste helped craft a constitutional amendment with a close friend who happened to be a Chilean senator, Chile became the first nation to enshrine the right to mental privacy and the right to free will in its national constitution. Mexico, Brazil, and Uruguay are already considering something similar. Even the United Nations has started talking about neurotech: Secretary-General António Guterres gave it a shoutout in his 2021 report, “Our Common Agenda,” after meeting with Yuste. Ultimately, Yuste wants a new international treaty on neurorights and a new international agency to make sure countries comply with it. He imagines the creation of something like the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the use of nuclear energy. But establishing a new global treaty is probably too ambitious as an opening gambit, so for now, he and Genser are exploring other possibilities. “We’re not saying that there necessarily need to be new human rights created,” Genser told me, explaining that he sees a lot of promise in simply updating current interpretations of human rights law — for example, extending the right to privacy to include mental privacy. That’s relevant both on the international level — he’s talking to the UN about updating the provision on privacy that appears in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights — and on the national and state levels. While not every nation will amend its constitution, states with a comprehensive privacy law could amend that to cover mental privacy. That’s the path Colorado is taking. If US federal law were to follow Colorado in recognizing neural data as sensitive health data, that data would fall under the protection of HIPAA, which Yuste said would alleviate much of his concern. Another possibility would be to get all neurotech devices recognized as medical devices so they would have to be approved by the FDA. When it comes to changing the law, Genser said, “It’s about having options.” A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here!

"1","WASHINGTON — The first question isn’t why special counsel David C. Weiss charged longtime informant Alexander Smirnov with making false claims about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The question is: Why now? In 2024, an election year. On Thursday, Weiss unsealed a 37-page indictment that charged Smirnov with making “a materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statement” in June 2020 to an FBI agent about the Bidens seeking $5 million each from a Ukrainian energy concern, Burisma. A second count involves making a false entry on an FBI form. The revelation gave oxygen to the legal defense team representing the president’s son. Smirnov, who should be presumed innocent, was arrested at Harry Reid International Airport on Wednesday and has a hearing Tuesday before Magistrate Daniel Albregts in Las Vegas. In March 2017, according to the indictment, Smirnov told his FBI handler about a call with a Burisma official and mentioned that Hunter Biden was a Burisma board member. It wasn’t until June 2020 that Smirnov reported two earlier meetings that ostensibly occurred in 2015 and 2016. Travel records suggested they didn’t happen, Weiss asserted. Hence these charges against a small-change witness. It’s “really hard for prosecutors to charge perjury,” University of Virginia law professor Saikrishna Prakash told me. While pundits say the Smirnov charges make House Republicans look bad, the FBI looks worse. Smirnov had been a “confidential human source” involved in cases going back to Oct. 1, 2010, and, the indictment noted, he was “authorized to engage in criminal activity as part of an on-going criminal investigation.” I want to learn more about that. Smirnov was feeding the feds so much dirt that he was admonished that he had to provide “truthful information” at least 20 times, according to the indictment. In short, Smirnov worked as a “snitch.” Snitches have a reputation for playing law enforcement to their advantage, while law enforcement has a reputation for looking the other way. I have trouble believing that any FBI agent would consider going after a vice president’s son based on the word of a career informant. Indeed, the FBI didn’t find the accusations credible. Hence the lack of action, until now. To the average voter, the real scandal is that Burisma recruited Biden to serve on its board for a position that, according to the New York Times , paid him more than $800,000 in 2013 and more than $1.2 million in 2014, while his father was vice president and Ukraine was part of the veep’s portfolio. At the time, the New York Times reported, Hunter Biden “was a Yale-educated lawyer who had served on the boards of Amtrak and a number of nonprofit organizations and think tanks, but lacked any experience in Ukraine and just months earlier had been discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine.” And still he earned that kind of money. Weiss also has charged Hunter Biden with making false statements — for lying about his drug use while he possessed a gun. Weiss clearly takes perjury seriously. It’s downright refreshing.

"1","New York’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral, self-labeled “America’s Parish Church,” recently held a funeral service for self-identified transgender activist, atheist, and former sex worker Cecilia Gentili. “This wh*re. This great wh*re. St. Cecilia [Gentili], mother of all wh*res,” exclaimed attender Oscar Diaz during the service, while clergy sat by. He was met with a standing ovation from the crowd. Diaz told Time magazine that Gentili was “part of their chosen family.” “We lost our saint,” said Ceyenne Doroshow , a transgender-identified individual and sex worker activist. “You might have heard the story that Jesus ministered to all. Cecilia ministered to all.” Doroshow then led the crowd in chanting Gentili’s name multiple times. St. Patrick’s Cathedral, which is located in New York City, was filled with over 1,000 people, with many attendees wearing thongs, fishnet tights, and other similarly inappropriate garments. “It felt appropriate to send her off in this way, to give her her ‘sainthood,’” Diaz said. The Rev. Fr. Edward Dougherty, a retired priest currently serving at St. Patrick’s, led the service. After telling the funeral attendees that “Cecilia died with Christ,” he joked , “Except on Easter Sunday, we don’t really have a crowd that is this well turned out.” St. Patrick’s Response Gentili was the first transgender-identified individual to be allowed a funeral at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, funeral organizers claimed. The New York Times described the event as one “with no likely precedent in Catholic history.” The service was originally intended to be celebrated as a funeral Mass, but the decision was made early to switch to the former. “What we do is we move to a funeral service, no mass,” someone was heard telling Fr. Dougherty. Despite the change, the funeral service was still punctuated with hymns and prayers from the presiding clergy, whose perceived lack of proper preparation, management, and respect for Church teaching has ignited criticism from Catholics online. Organizations such as TFP Student Action, a young Catholic group, have called for “reparation … for this sacrilege.” Fr. Nicholas Gregoris, founding member of the Priestly Society of Blessed John Henry Cardinal Newman, echoed this sentiment, posting on X that “This blasphemous & sacrilegious fiasco was a deplorable desecration of America’s most famous Catholic Church.” Following the funeral service, the rector of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Fr. Enrique Salvo, released a statement, saying : “The Cathedral only knew that family and friends were requesting a funeral Mass for a Catholic, and had no idea our welcome and prayer would be degraded in such a sacrilegious and deceptive way…. At the Cardinal’s directive, we have offered an appropriate Mass of Reparation.” Gentili’s family objected to the cathedral’s explanation and released a statement of their own. Calling Gentili’s funeral a “historic defiance of the Church’s hypocrisy and anti- trans hatred,” the family said, “We bestow sainthood upon Cecilia, for her life’s work, for how she ministered, mothered, and loved all people regardless of HIV, immigration, or employment status.” AOC’s Ash Wednesday Disrespect On Ash Wednesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) spoke on the floor of Congress, praising fellow New Yorker Gentili for living “her truth as a transwoman.” “I rise today to reflect on the life and legacy of beloved Queens community leader, Cecilia Gentili,” AOC said, with ashes in the shape of a cross — a Catholic symbol of death and repentance — smeared on her forehead. “She devoted much of her life to uplifting our trans and undocumented community in Queens.” CatholicVote said on X that AOC’s comments “mock the Christian faith in the most vile way imaginable,” but it wasn’t just hers — he funeral itself made a mockery of Christianity, from the garments and songs to the paintings of Gentili positioned at the front of the cathedral that copied the ancient art of iconography and read “holy wh*re.” It remains to be seen if the cathedral will take any steps to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future."
"1","Since Oct. 17 , Iranian proxies have targeted U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria, and Jordan over 160 times . On Jan. 28, three U.S. soldiers were killed , and more than 30 other service members were injured following a done attack conducted by an Iranian-backed militia. In response, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces launched a targeted airstrike in Baghdad, killing a senior leader of Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah. Unfortunately, these limited strikes have not stopped the near-daily attacks against the 900 U.S. troops based in Syria and the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops based in Iraq. With no end in sight, U.S. senators are demanding that the administration do more to deter Iranian aggression. “The administration’s military and economic responses to Iran and its proxies have not only been disproportionate, they appear to be completely disjointed,” argued Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and 24 Republicans in a letter addressed to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. (READ MORE: Mr. Biden, Why Do You Hide Your True Self? ) The letter claims that “a strong signal of deterrence—utilizing military, economic, and diplomatic tools—is needed if we want to stop the attacks against U.S. personnel and prevent the war in Gaza from expanding into a protracted regional conflict.” Some Republicans argue that the administration must target Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp fighters directly and if that doesn’t deter Iran, to target Tehran’s strategic assets. Others are calling for the administration to freeze the $6 billion and additional $10 billion of sanctions relief money to Iran, to fully enforce U.S. oil sanctions, and interdict Iranian oil exports — all moves that would reimpose key elements of the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure campaign.” Drugs Can (and Do) Fund Iran and Its Proxies Economic pressure and military action are not enough. Drug smuggling also provides Iran and its proxies with alternative funding that it can use to ramp up attacks against U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq. Illicit narcotics like Captagon are a major source of revenue for Iran and its proxies. Dubbed “the poor man’s cocaine,” Captagon is a synthetic amphetamine-type stimulant that took off in 2018 and now bankrolls the Assad Regime and Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria. Popular Mobilization Force (PMF) militias like Kataib Hezbollah, for example, receive a cut of the $10 billion Captagon drug trade by providing cover for drug smugglers along the Syrian-Iraqi border. These groups are behind many of the attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq today. (READ MORE: The American People Know the Real Hamas ) Given the high demand for Captagon in the region, Lebanese Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies can tap into Captagon revenues when the U.S. implements additional sanctions against Iran. For its part, Congress introduced and passed several bills to mitigate the threat of Captagon. H.R. 4681 and H.R. 6265 sanctioned individuals tied to the trade and required the interagency to produce a strategy that would disrupt, degrade, and dismantle the illicit Captagon networks linked to the Assad regime. That strategy was released in June 2023. Following the Oct. 7 attack against Israel, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced H.R . 836 , which called for the formation of an interagency counter-Captagon task force to “enhance interdiction efforts” through intelligence sharing and precursor supply flow monitoring. Such efforts are meant to limit Iran and its proxies of the ability to use drug money to finance terrorism in the region. Cut Drug Money to Defund Terrorism This is not the first time that an Iranian-backed group used drug money to fund terrorism. According to a 2018 Treasury Department report , Lebanese Hezbollah receives an estimated $700 million annually from Iran and raises another $300 million from a vast network of illegal businesses tied to the Latin American drug trade. Hezbollah’s nefarious business dealings with Latin American drug cartels traced back to the 1980s when Lebanese nationals worked with cocaine drug traffickers in Colombia and South America. (READ MORE: The Spectacle Ep. 60: What Is Next in Israel? Nobody Knows. ) Successive U.S. administrations throughout the 1980s and 1990s sanctioned Iran for its support for terrorism, which forced Lebanese Hezbollah to find alternative funding. The group relied on revenue from cocaine smuggling in Latin America to fund a series of attacks against U.S. and Israeli targets, including the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and the 1994 bombing against a Jewish cultural center in Argentina. Captagon is today’s cocaine. Sanctions may slow down Iran, but its proxies in the region can still tap into the Captagon drug trade to finance attacks. The stakes are high for the United States. Iranian proxies are attacking U.S. troops daily with no end in sight. Cracking down on the Captagon drug trade will cut off one revenue stream that Iran and its proxies use to fuel these attacks."
"1","Conservative groups today are splintering into sects squabbling over what true conservatism is. The last Republican president to unite these sects was Ronald Reagan. He won election and then reelection by wide margins, turned over the White House to his own party, and restored America’s self-confidence, prosperity and global appeal. The only other president to do that in the 20 th century was a Democrat, Franklin Roosevelt. Conservatives today are not only ignoring Reagan’s legacy, they are attacking it. They blame him for too much globalism, too much trade and too much immigration. They say he won the Cold War abroad but lost the culture war at home. They claim he put excessive emphasis on individualism rather than the common good, free market solutions rather than using the leverage of government, and equal opportunity under the law while liberals “marched through the institutions” to “cancel” equal treatment. (READ MORE: Make Biden Own His Weaknesses ) Reagan deserves a voice in this debate. He united the warring branches of conservatism — from traditionalists who believe faith holds America to a higher standard, to libertarians who champion individual rights and freedom of choice, to globalists who believe freedom is universal, and to nationalists who insist on America First. He understood that winning in politics requires an energized partisan base, an outreach to independents and conservative Democrats, and a political coalition on the Hill to implement conservative priorities. “You do not get to be a majority party,” Reagan warned , “by searching for groups you won’t associate or work with.” In short, you don’t win by excluding groups — or by ignoring the Reagan’s legacy. How did Reagan define conservatism and lead it to a majority status in American politics? He thought about most of these issues long before he entered public life. Based on voluminous materials written “in his own hand,” he can speak for himself. Let’s take a look at what he thought, wrote and said about conservatism and the relationship between the individual and the group, civil society and public life, and national interests and world politics. Individual and Group Reagan identified conservatism with the freedom and dignity of individual choice. The ultimate source of authority was not some privileged group (race, class, experts) or institution (church) but individuals acting as “we the people” under the checks and balances of the constitution of a republic. In 1947, when conservatives were mired in the postwar debate between communism and liberalism, Reagan was already declaring : “Our highest aim should be the cultivation of freedom of the individual, for therein lies the highest dignity of man.” But this individualism was not license, nor was it individualism without groups or without interest for the common good. It was individualism relatively free to “choose” the community or common good individuals preferred. This freedom to choose gave individuals dignity. They were not branded by race or religion to join or remain in groups they did not choose. They exercised self-government i n the context of civil society, the numerous private associations of family, neighborhood, schools, markets and church that mediate between state and citizens. It was individualism marinated in learning and reason, tradition and faith — a “deliberative and moral individualism” that united traditional conservatives who valued religion and virtue with libertarian conservatives who valued reason and meritocracy. Religion and reason were not separate wings of conservatism, they were integral components of the philosophy of conservatism. “What I envision,” Reagan said , “is not simply a melding together of the two branches of American conservatism into a temporary uneasy alliance, but the creation of a new, lasting majority.” (READ MORE: The Enduring Ronald Reagan ) How do individual freedom, learning and faith go together? “At its full flowering,” Reagan continued, “freedom is the first principle of society … yet freedom cannot exist alone. “For what is wrought by freedom unaccompanied by learning and faith?” Reagan answered: “human behavior untempered by a sense of moral, spiritual, or intellectual limits.” In short, human freedom unmoored in learning and faith is simply individual vanity. “That’s why,” Reagan concluded , “the theme of … learning, faith, and freedom is so apt … Each reinforces the others, each makes the others possible. For what are they without each other?” “America is what she is because she is guided by all three: learning, faith, and freedom.” Why is learning necessary? Because it empowers reason and enables the individual to think critically, to contemplate different alternatives, undermine dogma, even religious dogma, and create choice. For, without alternatives, there is no choice and hence no freedom. “True freedom of choice,” Reagan wrote to the editor of Pegasus, a Eureka College student newspaper in 1971, “is impossible until we are sufficiently self-disciplined to know what the results of our choices will be.” “God gave us … freedom,” Reagan said at the Vatican in June 1987, “when he gave us free will,” reason to evaluate outcomes and choose between right and wrong, good and evil — all in an open public square in which Reagan believed, citing Thomas Jefferson , “error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.” But what is learning without faith? “Despotism,” Reagan opined, “may govern without faith, but liberty cannot. Religion is more needed in democratic societies than in any other.” Why? Because “learning,” Reagan observed , “does not — not by the longest measure — bring wisdom.” “ Unless it’s tempered by faith and a love of freedom, it can be very dangerous indeed … It can also bring evil.” Think, Reagan said, of “the names of many intellectuals … recorded on the rolls of infamy — from Robespierre to Lenin to Ho Chi Minh to Pol Pot.” Now Reagan reveals the depth and subtlety of his thinking. For faith, too, he acknowledges, can run amuck and must be tempered. “ What will faith without a respect for learning and an understanding of freedom bring?” he asks. “We’ve seen the tragedy of untempered faith in the hellish deaths of 14-year-old boys — small hands still wrapped around machine guns, on the front lines in Iran.” He was referring, of course, to religious wars, raging between Iran and Iraq at the time and across nations throughout human history. Faith disciplines learning and holds human beings accountable to a higher law. It compels us to treat one another as children of God not just members of the same higher biological species. I n one of his most thoughtful aphorisms, Reagan summed up the role of religion in a free or republican society: “I recognize we must be cautious in claiming God is on our side, but I think it’s all right to keep asking if we’re on His side.” Think about that for a minute — religion is indispensable in a republic but no specific religion can be imposed in the public square. And individuals inspired by religion in the public square cannot claim to have God on their side; they must humbly ask instead if they are on God’s side. Self-restraint by learning and faith is a perquisite of self-government. As Jefferson wrote in his first inaugural and Reagan paraphrased in his first inaugural, “if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?” The Conservative Public Square The three pillars of conservatism — freedom, learning and faith — stand together or they fail separately. As Reagan warned , alone they are “very dangerous.” If secular libertarians expel their faith-based colleagues from the conservative public square, they are themselves playing God. For godlessness, secularism, too is a faith. “To make man stand alone without God,” Reagan warned , “is actually the second oldest faith, the first proclaimed in the Garden of Eden with the words of temptation, ‘Ye shall be as gods.’” Thus, libertarians, standing alone as gods or without gods, corrupt the public square. But the same holds for traditionalists. If they expel secular libertarians from the conservative fold, they cancel their own freedom. For without reason and learning, there is no way to imagine alternatives and hence no freedom of choice. Now religion dictates in the public square, not inspires, and the question becomes “whose religion?” The wall between church and state collapses and the prospects of self-government vanish. (READ MORE: By Echoing Newsom, Biden Risks Becoming Carter ) It is the integration, the blending together of the classical (tradition) and the liberal (reason) that defines modern conservatism. Reagan startled his guests at a White House dinner late in his presidency when he said : “Well, you know, it is possible that we conservatives are the real liberals and the liberals are the real conservatives.” What did he mean? One thing is sure. He had been thinking about it for a long time. In the original 1965 edition of his first autobiography , Reagan writes: “the classical liberal used to be the man who was, and should be forever, the master of his destiny. That is now the conservative position … The liberal used to believe in freedom under law. Now he believes in a stronger and stronger central government” In an interview with Reason in 1975, Reagan reiterated: “I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals—if we were back in the days of the [American] Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the liberals and the liberals would be the Tories.” In a letter written before his presidency, he summed it up: “Today’s conservative is … the true liberal — in the classic meaning of the word. But it is today’s so-called liberal who … affixed the title conservative on those who opposed his affinity for centralized authority and a big government.” Reagan detested this attempt to define conservatism as simply an opposition to liberalism. For him, conservatism, “in the classical meaning of the word,” was all about freeing the individual from the authoritarian clutches of Tory aristocrats, papal authorities and social-engineering bureaucrats. Classical conservatism relocated choice at the level of the individual, the ordinary human being, not the group, the church or the state. Fallible as that individual might be, he or she was capable, equipped by learning (education) and faith , to pass judgment on human affairs in the public square. Conservatives will endlessly debate whether the Enlightenment delivered or destroyed true freedom, but in doing so they acknowledge that “classical conservatism” did not overthrow but “conserved” principles from the past (religion, the classics). It did so precisely in order to discipline the choices of free individuals in the future (liberty). Reagan, again, said it best : “The principles of conservatism are sound because they are based on what men and women have discovered through experience in not just one generation or a dozen, but in all the combined experience of mankind.” The National Public Square On the home front, Reagan exhorted Republicans to declare this positive vision of conservatism in “bold, unmistakable colors with no pale pastel shades.” Conservatives do not just stand in the way of liberals, he believed, they stand for a different way . They stand for freedom of the individual, limited central government, and equality of opportunities. Liberals, by contrast, stand for groups — race, tribe, class, collective, gender, village, etc. — activist central government, and equality of outcomes not just opportunities. Liberals fear tyranny most in the private sector (corrupt corporations, racial discrimination, inequality, and the like) and urge central government to intervene. Conservatives fear tyranny most in the public sector (administrative state, attacks on constitutional checks and balances, arrests without due process, political weaponization of federal agencies, and the like) and urge solutions by local government and private sector actors. Both threats are real and need to be addressed. In a healthy national public square, liberals and conservatives check and balance one another. They constitute the guardrails of the American Republic, protecting unalienable individual rights through institutional checks and balances. In this context the two-party system works well. Robust, albeit peaceful, partisanship highlights the content (principles) as well as the process (compromise) of politics. It protects the existence of substantive alternatives and free choice. Too many alternatives, on the other hand, confound choice. Reagan rejected a “third party” and called instead for “a new first party made up of people who share our principles.” Choice and compromise vanish, however, when the political parties try to expel one another from the public square. Liberals do so when they insist on only one legitimate point of view and cancel opposing views as “evil.” They play god in the public square. Conservatives do it when they insist on no common point of view and sanction individual license and anarchy. They reject the public square altogether. Both extremes betray the fundamental premise of self-government, a willingness to trust the people to govern themselves. To sum it up, Reagan insisted on differences within the guard rails: “Our party must be the party of the individual. It must not sell out the individual to cater to the group…. Freedom rests, and it always has, on individual responsibility, individual integrity, individual effort, individual courage, and yes, individual faith … No greater challenge faces our society today than ensuring that each one of us can maintain his dignity and his identity in an increasingly complex, centralized society.” The Global Public Square In foreign policy Reagan applied conservative principles to political affairs abroad. Global politics, just like domestic politics, was about the struggle for individual freedom and dignity. Reagan divided the world into domestic political systems that were free and those that were not. The Cold War, he said at Eureka College in 1957, “wasn’t really a new struggle at all. It was the oldest struggle of humankind, as old as man himself.” It is the “irreconcilable conflict…. between those who believe in the sanctity of individual freedom and those who believe in the supremacy of the state.” The conflict was spiritual not material. At Westminster, Reagan declared : “the ultimate determinant in the struggle that is now going on in the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas, a trial of spiritual resolve.” Such a conflict could only be won or lost; it could not end by moral equivalence. He called the Soviet Union an “evil empire” and declared : “we win; they lose.” Just as he started with individualism in the national public square, he started with nationalism in the global public square. He was first and foremost an American nationalist; and conservative nationalists in his day, the so-called paleoconservatives, supported him. Anchored in nationalism, Reagan’s foreign policy was thoroughly conservative not liberal. It called for a world of strong nation-states not universal global institutions, independent national defenses not collective security, competitive markets not expert-driven globalization, defense of freedom where it exists not ending tranny everywhere at once, more equal- burden sharing by allies not free-riding, and negotiations to encourage peaceful democratic reforms not morally equivalent coexistence. Reagan defined national interests in terms of concentric circles. The health of America came first. He rebuilt its military and economic power and self-confidence. America’s neighborhood came second. He called for a North America Accord and Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and the Cancun Summit, an inaugural meeting of what later became the Group of 20. Reagan endorsed the Monroe Doctrine. There was no going abroad without a secure and prosperous western hemisphere. Beyond this hemisphere, Reagan rallied the free nations and allies of Europe and Asia, not just because free nations share basic values of individual freedom and choice but also because they were needed to contain and eventually defeat authoritarian powers such as the former Soviet Union. America was involved in world affairs, Reagan believed, not by choice or geopolitics but by who we are. We are the beachhead of “republican self-government” in the world. As Reagan once mused , our role in the world was “thrust upon us some two centuries ago in that little hall in Philadelphia.” At that time we were weak, not strong. Yet we threatened monarchs in Europe and Asia. America was exceptional because it was experimental not because it was powerful. It was the first large nation to pursue self-government by individuals of all backgrounds with the freedom to choose. America had no monarch, state church or even common history. Yet, as Reagan said, if we succeed , “we are proof that all mankind can live together in peace.” And “if we lose freedom here,” Reagan pointed out, “there is no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth.” Reagan’s concentric nationalism was inspiring and forward looking. It united nationalists and globalists. It reassured nationalists that America respected borders, sovereignty, the homeland and patriotism. Without the nationalists, America would have no anchor and would dissolve into a world of globalist grifters and the unaccountable global institutions they promote. On the other hand, globalists reminded America that freedom is in the imagination of human beings everywhere. If not, where then did freedom in America come from? Except for a few native Americans, Americans are immigrants. If the United States is just another country like every other, what is the American project — race (1619 Project), populism (soil), blood (patriotism)? Where does that lead us. Back to the world of 1914 or 1945? Reagan’s Conservatism in the 21st Century Would Reagan modify this conservative vision today? Of course. Circumstances change. But the concentric circles would remain. They are the building blocks of global conservatism. Reagan might insist on three caveats: First, trade with free allies must be conducted on a reciprocal basis . That means, no more subsidies or special access to U.S. markets. American products get the same treatment in free countries’ markets as free countries have in the America market. Period! And the free allied nations have to man up on defense spending. America accounts for roughly 1/3 of free nations’ GDP. It should bear no more than 1/3 of NATO’s defense expenditures. The ratio is improving in Ukraine, currently about 50-50, and the addition of Finland (bordering Russia) and Sweden to NATO is pivotal. But burden sharing is still not proportionate. Second, inviting China to participate in global markets was well-meaning but naïve. Economic progress does not automatically lead to political reform. Reagan never assumed that. Domestic reform came first. He opposed détente and significant economic ties with the Soviet Union until Moscow introduced domestic political reforms. He would do the same today with respect to China. Third, China and Russia have clearly decided on a course of militant conflict with the western-led international order. The “oldest struggle of humankind” persists. However, the United States has no need to prioritize one of these conflicts over the other or withdraw entirely to the western hemisphere. The conflict is ideological and transcends regions. Reagan would clearly see it that way. If the United States prioritizes China, free nations in Europe must take the lead in defense of Ukraine. Fourth, although Reagan gave amnesty in 1986 to some 3 million illegal immigrants, thereby encouraging millions more illegal immigrants, he would have never condoned the obliteration of America’s borders that exists today. Even at a time when the issue was less critical, Reagan approved a wall, albeit one with doors, for legal immigration. In his farewell address to the American people in 1989, he said : “if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and heart to get here.” That’s an endorsement of a wall if we can’t find any other solution, and so far we haven’t. A wall to keep people out, moreover, is not the same as one to keep people in (the Berlin Wall). It is a badge of success not failure. So, if it comes to that, America can still hold its head high. Reagan’s accomplishments are still with us — a more prosperous and democratic world than ever before; a Republican Party that seized power in Congress in 1995 for the first time since 1933 and remains competitive today (sharing since 1995 roughly the same number of years in control of Congress and the White House as Democrats); numerous conservative think tanks that did not exist in 1970; a conservative Supreme Court for the first time in 60 years and hundreds of new conservative judges on lower courts; an explosion of school choice and charter schools and now a growing push back against woke-ism in grade schools and higher education; and welfare reforms that restored individual dignity and responsibility by providing jobs and moving the poor permanently off the dole into the free economy. Nothing is guaranteed but, at the margins, conservatives are winning the culture war with liberalism, if they can only see it. Reagan contributed to that turn-around more than anyone else. Isn’t his view of conservatism worth another look?"
"1","T he Russians have taken Avdiivka, and President Joe Biden faces a tough choice: he either closes the Mexican border or loses Ukraine. The $61 billion supplemental aid package for Ukraine, which may be the minimum required to block further Russian advances, remains held up by Congress, which is unlikely to pass it anytime soon unless the administration returns to the tough border policies of former President Donald Trump. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson responded to Democrat machinations to force a vote last week by putting the House of Representatives in recess. If Ukraine does not get the aid needed to replenish seriously depleted ammunition stocks soon, there won’t be sufficient artillery or air defense ammunition to contain further Russian moves. According to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), intense air strikes by Russian Su-34 and Su-35 fighter aircraft supporting ground forces in Avdiivka proved crucial in Russia’s victory. (READ MORE: Putting America First Means Standing Up to Bullies ) “The Russian ability to conduct these mass strikes for several days in the most active part of the frontline suggests that Ukrainian forces were not able to deny them access to the airspace around Avdiivka…. Delays in Western security assistance may lead to further significant constraints on Ukrainian air defenses that could allow Russian forces to replicate the close air support that facilitated Russian advances in Avdiivka at scale in Ukraine,” ISW reported. Glide bombs with half-ton warheads dropped by the Sukhois on a coke plant serving as a Ukranian fortress, decided Ukraine’s newly appointed army commander, General Oleksandr Syrsky, on sounding the retreat. He had personally led the crack 3 rd Assault Brigade equipped with American Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles to reinforce Avdiivka, but when air strikes triggered a chemical fire in the coke plant, releasing a toxic cloud, he realized the situation was hopeless. Despite his reputed indifference to casualties, Syrsky pulled out the troops to “preserve their lives and health,” according to the official statement. His two or three brigades, including exhausted units who had held out in Avdiivka for four months, were facing seven Russian brigades encircling the city. The capture of Avdiivka, which cost Russia over 20,000 casualties and thousands of destroyed tanks, combat vehicles, and artillery pieces, solidified the vital central front in Donetsk. Despite the city’s small size (its original population numbered 30,000), it presented a major obstacle to Putin’s plans to dominate the Donbas region. The town controls a railway and threatened Russia’s hold on nearby Bahkmut, a city similarly captured by Russia last spring following an 8-month siege and 25,000 casualties. (READ MORE: The Stable Path: Two Years of Ukraine’s Fight for Survival ) With its central front consolidated, Russia can start moving towards Kramatorsk, the industrial heart of Donbas, which Su-34s started bombing following Avdiivka’s fall last week. With a population of 100,000, modern steel plants, vast iron mines, gas fields, and sophisticated engineering facilities, the control of Kramatorsk is a key prize that Putin would need to secure in any future negotiations to partition Ukraine, which now seems all but inevitable. Russia is also intensifying attacks in Zaporizhzhia to dislodge the Ukranians from Robotyne, which they captured in a failed counteroffensive to penetrate Russia’s southern defensive lines last summer. Russian attacks are also underway in the northern sector of Kupiansk and various other points along the 1,000-mile front where Putin is reported to be massing a half million troops for an all- out offensive following the Russian elections when he will be free to induct hundreds of thousands more men into the army. Europeans are scrambling to get weapons to Ukraine. As Avdiivka fell, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky flew to Paris and Berlin to plead for arms. Expressing fears about a possible collapse of the Ukrainian army, the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell, called on member states to ship weapons “immediately”. Half a million of badly needed 155 artillery rounds are on the way, according to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who has called for the creation of a “defense post” to coordinate assistance. But it’s only half the quantity promised by Germany a year ago and there are serious doubts that Europe can match Russia’s output of over 100,000 rounds per month anytime soon. Russia is also receiving munitions from North Korea and Iran, prompting European defense officials to approach South Korea for help. Ukraine’s NASAM air defense missiles, being replenished by Norway, and IRIS-T systems, being supplied by Germany, lack the necessary speed and range to intercept Russia’s hypersonic missiles, which can only be stopped by American Patriot missiles that run out next month according to U.S. estimates. It could present the the window of opportunity for Putin to unleash his full arsenal of Kh-22s, Kh-59s, and other missiles to knock out Ukraine’s energy and industrial infrastructure, according to former Royal United Services Institute director, Michael Clarke. Although Europe is waking up to the threat posed by Russia and several countries are ramping up defense spending past the 2 percent of GDP that Donald Trump demanded, they are hardly in shape to take on Russia. The UK, for example, which has been the most vociferous backer of Ukraine, lacks sailors to crew its ships, and its new aircraft carrier can’t be put to sea . (READ MORE from Martin Arostegui: Ukraine and Russia Battle for Avdiivka ) American Democrats and the media will blame “Republican Trump Supporters” if Ukraine is eventually overrun or forced to negotiate a humiliating peace with Russia. Indications of such an outcome were evident at the international Munich Conference last week where China’s foreign minister dismissed direct appeals by Ukraine’s foreign minister to broker talks, on the basis that “conditions in Ukraine are not yet conducive to negotiations,” which some analysts interpret as meaning that Putin remains short of his territorial goals. The Biden administration bears overriding responsibility for any tragic outcome of the Ukraine conflict. Its obscene withdrawal from Afghanistan encouraged Putin to test Western resolve. Its green energy policies locked European allies into a dependence on Russian oil and gas which they still can’t shake off, despite sanctions, and the billiard effect of its open borders policy now threatens to sink Kyiv. As Harry Truman said, “The buck stops here” and when a president embarks on a high-stakes military enterprise that can alter the world balance of power, he must be prepared to sacrifice whatever is necessary for a successful outcome. What is necessary in this case is to reverse a border policy opposed by the vast majority of Americans to marshal the political support to halt Russia. Is Biden capable of being a statesman or is he destined to remain a party machine politician beholden to a cabal of billionaire donors and far-left apparatchiks?"
"1","Ever since the October 7 Hamas pogrom polls have indicated that there has been a massive shift rightward in Israeli society. A poll by the Direct Polls organization indicates that 44 percent of Israelis, including 30 percent of leftists, have moved politically to the right. It’s common for people to rally round the flag during wartime but this shift has been due neither to blind patriotism nor to government propaganda. On the contrary, the shift has been organic, from the bottom up. It is the upshot of people having epiphanies arising from personal experiences and is also based on popular images about how the war is playing out on the battlefield. One of the ongoing criticisms of the Haredi community from the Israeli secular Left is that they are exempt from military duty. However, the Haredi are not the only Orthodox sector of Israeli society. The most interesting aspect of the shift to the right is that it has stemmed from the acknowledgment by many on the Left of the outsized sacrifices of a different religious sector of society, the religious-Zionists, to the work on the battlefield. Notably this contribution arises directly from religious values and conviction. (READ MORE from Max Dublin: Moloch Is Back: Sacrificing Our Children ) The highest value of the Jewish religion is the protection and preservation of life. It supersedes all other religious values including the most stringent rules of religious observance. From the very beginning of this war no sector of Israeli society has embodied this value more than the religious-Zionist camp (not to be confused with the party of the same name). On October 7 this supreme value was epitomized in the heroic actions of the Kalmanzon brothers who belonged to a religious community called Otniel in the Hebron hills. Elhanan Kalmanzon was a reserve major in the IDF and a member of Mossad. As soon as he heard about the Hamas invasion, he immediately called his brother Menachem and, though it was the Sabbath when driving is forbidden, they jumped in a car and sped to where the Hamas pogrom was taking place. When they arrived, they found an abandoned armored troop carrier and for fourteen and a half hours went house-to-house in Kibbutz Be’eri pulling besieged kibbutz members through the windows of their safe- rooms and transporting them to safety. They saved about a hundred of the kibbutz members this way but in the end the terrorists managed to kill Elhanan on what turned out to be his last run. Ironically, as Caroline Glick has pointed out, Kibbutz Be’eri was part of the leftist community that during the anti-government protests before the war had vilified people like the Kalmanzon brothers. Surviving members of Kibbutz Be’eri attended Elhanan’s shiva where his father called for national unity. From this example it is easy to imagine why the country is unifying towards the Right. But what the Kalmanzon brothers did was not unique. Since the beginning of this war, it has become evident to the Israeli public that a disproportionate number of soldiers who have fallen in action have come from the Religious-Zionist camp. Despite the fact that this sector comprises only ten percent of Israeli society, it has suffered forty-five percent of the casualties. The reason for this is that an inordinate number of soldiers who belong to this camp sign up for combat units in the IDF. On the internet you can find images of religious warriors saying prayers while in the field. In recognition of the qualities that have led to their service to their country the Jerusalem Post has editorialized, “Most within this camp agree that there is religious significance in the reborn State of Israel and that defending it is both a historic privilege and a religious value.” These facts seem to fly in the face of the leftist narrative about the true essence of Israeli society. Israeli leftists like to point out that the early Zionists were secular Jews just like them. This was indeed true but only up to a point. As secular Jews they were not so assimilated as to be willing to completely erase their Jewish identity in order to feel safe. Nor, obviously, were they assimilated to the point where they were willing to forget that Israel had once been the Jewish homeland. If they had been that assimilated there would not have been a Zionist movement at all. It must be remembered that in the late nineteenth century, just when the Zionist movement was taking off, it was explicitly rejected by the Reform movement in America. In its Pittsburgh Platform of 1885 not only did the Reform movement reject Zionism it also rejected what it called Jewish ritual including the most basic rules of religious observance while calling its places of worship temples, fitting them with organs, and purposely not facing them eastward towards Jerusalem. In other words, it tried as hard as possible to assimilate to the then dominant Christian culture in America. Assimilation is a very good thing. It is absolutely essential in any society that wishes to create and maintain the social cohesion and unity that it needs in order to function, flourish, and ultimately even to survive. But any pressure for citizens to assimilate beyond what is needed to achieve unity is distinctly undemocratic and illiberal. In liberal-democracies the melting pot was never intended to be a smelting pot; it was never meant to be so absolute that it would nullify two of the other fundamental principles of liberal-democracy, tolerance and pluralism. When carried on indefinitely assimilation inevitably leads to a sort of extinction—not, of course, of the physical person but of all of the qualities that make one kind of person or community different from others. When the Assyrian empire conquered Israel about 2,700 years ago the Hebrew nation had already split into two parts, Judah and Israel. As was common then, the conquering Assyrians moved most of the Israel part to other parts of their empire and they never returned. They are the part that is now popularly known as the Lost Tribes. But they were not lost the way you might lose your wallet. They were lost because in time they were completely assimilated and as Jews completely faded away. This is what has steadily been happening to the Reform movement in America (though notably not in Canada where it is more conservative). The rejection of Jewish ritual by the Reform movement has ultimately turned into a slippery slope. For some time now the Reform movement in America has been twisting itself out of shape while trying to assimilate to the most perverse social trends, to the point where there is no longer anything recognizably Jewish about it. Only in America could arise the astonishing phenomenon of a Reform Rabbi consecrating a late-term abortion clinic. Meanwhile, despite these efforts, its numbers have been rapidly shrinking away much as has been happening to the most secularized parts of the Christian church. Currently there is a Jewish joke going around that succinctly summarizes this trend “Q. What is the difference between Donald Trump’s grandchildren and those of a Reform Jew? A. Donald Trump’s grandchildren are Jewish.” (READ MORE: In Their Words: The Families of Hamas’ Victims ) If not for religious Jews, Israel would not have been a viable region for a Jewish nation-state. It’s safe to say that the Jews that managed to stay in Israel after the Roman expulsion as well as the small number that crept back before the advent of Zionism in the mid- to late-1800s were all religious Jews. Today they are not thought of as having been Zionists, but for two millennia this tiny beleaguered community is what constituted the continuous Jewish presence in the Promised Land. And in the diaspora it was the religious Jews, and not the disappearing ones, who were the culture- bearers of the Jewish traditions that, to varying degrees, define all Jewish sectors of Israeli society to this day. It is unfortunate that the militarily- excused cult-like Haredi with their retrograde attire and professed conviction that through round-the-clock Torah study it is they who are “sustaining the world” have become the face of the religious community. They are not its most authentic representatives. It is the religious-Zionists who represent the Jewish religion and Jewish tradition in its fullness. If one compares the Zionist movement with the Reform movement as alternate strategies for Jewish survival there is no question that Israel, with all of its challenges and difficulties, is the more successful. The secular Jews outside of Israel are heading for self-extinction, they are joining the Lost Tribes. In terms of Jewish survival some interesting and rather telling sorting and convergence is now taking place both in Israel and America. While before the Hamas pogroms Israeli leftists in the tech industry were threatening to leave the country, as soon as the war started Israelis working in Silicon Valley returned home en masse to participate in the call-up of reserves. Meanwhile in America some congregations that are collapsing are inviting the orthodox Chabad movement to take them over. In Israel Haredi men of military age, though exempted from military service, are starting to enlist in the IDF. In the end, dividing the Jewish religion into different segments is a mug’s game. What really exists is a spectrum with extreme religionists and extreme secularists on either end. But the heart of the Jewish religion is not about observance or even faith. The heart of the Jewish religion is about the values exemplified in the Ten Commandments and other parts of the Hebrew Bible and indeed, that is the Jews’ primary contribution to Western Civilization. I think that what appears to be a movement to the Right in Israel during the present war is really a movement towards those values, that is, towards the center. Politically if this holds it is very promising because it means that in the future centrist coalitions could be formed that exclude the extremists on either end of the political spectrum."
"2","A tiny fluffy monster kneels in wonder beside a lit candle. Two small pirate ships battle inside a churning cup of coffee. An octopus crawls along the sandy floor of the ocean. A Dalmatian puppy leaps from one windowsill to another. These are among a series of demo videos of OpenAI’s Sora, revealed last week, which can turn a short text prompt into up to a minute of video. The artificial intelligence model is not yet open to the public, but OpenAI has released the videos, along with the prompts that generated them. This was quickly followed by headlines calling Sora “eye-popping” and “ terrifying ” and “ jaw-dropping .” OpenAI researchers Tim Brooks and Bill Peebles told the New York Times that they picked “sora,” Japanese for “sky,” to emphasize the “idea of limitless creative potential.” There is another term, though, that OpenAI uses to describe Sora: a potential “world simulator, ” one that, over time, could create “highly-capable simulators of the physical and digital world, and the objects, animals and people that live within them.” It’s not there yet. While the available demo videos of Sora at work can feel uncanny and realistic, OpenAI’s technical paper on the model notes its many “limitations.” While Sora can sometimes accurately represent the changes on a canvas when a paint-laden brush sweeps across it or create bite marks in a sandwich after showing a man taking a bite, Sora “does not accurately model the physics of many basic interactions,” such as a glass breaking. People and objects can spontaneously appear and disappear, and like many AI models, Sora can “hallucinate.” Some AI experts, like Gary Marcus, have raised doubts about whether a model like Sora could ever learn to faithfully represent the laws of physics. But just as DALL-E and ChatGPT improved over time, so could Sora. And if its goal is to become a “world simulator,” it’s worth asking: What is the world that Sora thinks it’s simulating? Unknown worlds OpenAI has made that question kind of tough to answer, as the company has not disclosed much about what data was used to train Sora. But there are a couple of things we can infer. First, though, let’s look at how Sora works. Sora is a “diffusion transformer,” which is a fancy way of saying that it combines a couple different AI methods in order to work. Like many AI image generators (think DALL-E or Midjourney), Sora creates order from chaos based on the text prompt it receives, gradually learning how to turn a bunch of visual noise into an image that represents that prompt. That’s diffusion. The transformer bit has to do with how those still images relate to each other, creating the moving video. And Sora, OpenAI says, is designed to be a video-generating generalist. In order to do this, Sora would need a lot of data to learn from, reflecting a wide variety of styles, topics, duration, quality, and aspect ratios. OpenAI said in its technical paper that its development “takes inspiration from large language models which acquire generalist capabilities by training on internet- scale data.” While not directly saying this, it’s probably safe to guess that Sora, too, learned from some training data that was taken from the internet. It’s also possible, argued Nvidia AI researcher Jim Fan, that Sora was trained on a data set that incorporates a large amount of “synthetic” data from the latest version of Unreal Engine, a 3D graphics creation tool that is best known for powering the visuals in video games. OpenAI also has some agreements with companies that could provide large amounts of data for training purposes, like Shutterstock . As for the data that OpenAI did not, in the past, use with the agreement of its creator or publisher, well, there are some pending copyright lawsuits . Biased worlds AI bias is not new, and as Vox has explained before, it can be tough to combat. It creeps into training data and algorithms that power AI models in a lot of different ways. Since we don’t know what data Sora was trained on, and the tool is not available for the public to test, it’s hard to speak in much detail about how biases might be reflected in the videos it creates. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, has said that he believes AI will eventually learn to rid itself of bias. “I’m optimistic that we will get to a world where these models can be a force to reduce bias in society, not reinforce it,” he said to Rest of World last year. “Even though the early systems before people figured out these techniques certainly reinforced bias, I think we can now explain that we want a model to be unbiased, and it’s pretty good at that.” AI bias and ethics experts like Timnit Gebru have argued that this is exactly what people should not trust AI companies to do, telling the Guardian last year that we shouldn’t simply trust AI systems, or the people behind them, to self-regulate harms and bias. Made- up worlds A lot of the praise for Sora’s demo videos stems from their realism. And that’s exactly why disinformation experts are concerned here. A new study indicates that AI-generated propaganda created by GPT-3 (i.e., not even the newest GPT model powering the current generation of AI tools) can be just as persuasive as human-written content and takes a lot less effort to produce. Now apply that to video. Even without being able to faithfully replicate Earth physics, there are plenty of ways that a tool like Sora could be used, right now, to hurt and mislead people. “This is definitely slick, but I see two main uses: 1) to sell people more stuff (via ads) 2) to make non- consensual/misleading content to manipulate or harass people online,” wrote Sasha Luccioni, an AI research scientist at HuggingFace, on X . “Genuine question - why is everyone so excited?” OpenAI announced Sora a couple weeks after a wave of explicit, nonconsensual deepfakes of Taylor Swift circulated on social media. The images, as 404 media reported , were created with AI by exploiting loopholes in the systems that are designed to prevent exactly this from happening. To address potential biases and misuses of Sora, OpenAI is allowing only a small group of testers to evaluate its safety risks: “We are working with red teamers — domain experts in areas like misinformation, hateful content, and bias — who are adversarially testing the model,” the company said in a statement on X . A world with podcasting AI dogs, I guess Underneath all this are concerns about what Sora and other tools like it will do to the livelihoods of creative professionals, whose work has been used — often without payment — to train AI tools in order to approximate their jobs. Altman, on X, was taking follower suggestions for new Sora videos in order to show off glimpses of our glorious future, which will evidently be these AI- generated podcasting dogs: https://t.co/uCuhUPv51N pic.twitter.com/nej4TIwgaP — Sam Altman (@sama) February 15, 2024 Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Until relatively recently, good data on the problem of distracted driving has been hard to find. The government estimates that 3,522 people died because of it in 2021, but experts say the official number probably majorly undercounts the number of deaths, in part because police are rarely able to definitively prove that a driver was distracted right before a crash. In the last few years, though, the data on distracted driving has gotten better. Cambridge Mobile Telematics is a company that partners with major insurance companies to offer downloadable apps that drivers can use to save money on their rates. Via the apps, Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT) uses mobile phone sensors to measure driving behavior, including whether a person is speeding, holding their phone, or interacting with an unlocked screen while driving (the company says it doesn’t collect information on what the drivers are doing on their phones). Its work gives the company insight into the driving behaviors of more than 10 million people. CMT recently analyzed driver behavior during millions of car trips. What it found should be troubling to anyone who uses a road in the US: During the pandemic, American drivers got even more distracted by their phones while driving. The amount of distracted driving hasn’t receded, even as life has mostly stabilized. The company found that both phone motion and screen interaction while driving went up roughly 20 percent between 2020-2022. “By almost every metric CMT measures, distracted driving is more present than ever on US roadways. Drivers are spending more time using their phones while driving and doing it on more trips. Drivers interacted with their phones on nearly 58% of trips in 2022,” a recent report by the company concludes . More than a third of that phone motion distraction happens at over 50 mph. We’re also spending nearly three times more time distracted by our phones than drivers in the United Kingdom and several other European countries. US drivers spent an average of 2 minutes 11 seconds on their phones per hour while driving, compared to 44 seconds per hour for UK drivers, CMT found . The company compared the driving behaviors of US and European drivers because road fatalities in the United States surged during the pandemic and European fatalities did not. In 2020, 38,824 people died on US roads . In 2021, that number rose to 42,915 people, and the highest number of pedestrians were killed in 40 years . In 2022, the overall deaths stayed high, around 42,795, among them 7,508 pedestrians . The United States is increasingly an outlier when it comes to traffic fatalities , with rates 50 percent higher than its peers. The CMT findings suggest that the way Americans use their phones while driving could be one important reason why, along with road and vehicle design and a lack of consistent traffic safety enforcement . “The way individuals are driving their vehicles in the US is distinct from the way they’re driving in Europe,” says Ryan McMahon, senior vice president of strategy for Cambridge Mobile Telematics. That extra time Americans are spending on their phones while driving increases risk: In more than a third of crashes the company analyzed, McMahon says, the driver had their phone in their hand a minute prior to collision. The large increase in risky driving behaviors in the US started basically as soon as the pandemic began. “We saw this incredible increase in distracted driving. You could almost track it by the day schools started to shut down,” McMahon says. “When mobility changed, risk increased dramatically.” The individual and collective consequences of our cellphone compulsions are stark: The most distracted drivers are over 240 percent more likely to crash than the safest drivers, according to the report. The report also notes how the rise of smartphone use roughly corresponds to the rise in pedestrian fatalities: About 4,600 people were killed while walking in 2007, the year the iPhone was introduced. By 2021, with 85 percent of Americans owning smartphones, the number rose to 7,485. Why American drivers got more distracted during the pandemic McMahon and other experts on distracted driving have some theories. Culture may play a role: The shift to working from home, the fact that Americans work longer hours and vacation less , and the expectation that they need to be available to their colleagues even while driving is a notion many Europeans would scoff at. (As someone currently living in Europe after a lifetime in the United States, my highly subjective observation is that people really do seem less work-crazed in Europe. And while phone-checking while driving definitely happens, I see it a lot less than I do in the US.) “I do think this notion of work in our country, and [the idea that] you have to be available 24-7 has also exacerbated it,” says Pam Shadel Fischer, a senior director at the Governors Highway Safety Association, who’s been working for decades to reduce risky and impaired driving. “It’s absolutely a cultural issue.” The most compelling theories, though, are structural and psychological. In the United States, infrastructure is built around cars, and Americans generally have fewer public transportation options than Europeans do. They spend more time in their cars , commuting, doing chores, and taking children to school than people in European countries, and they are far more likely to make these daily trips on roads that are straight, flat, and built for easy car travel: a perfect recipe for boredom. While it’s difficult to generalize too much about Europe, anyone who’s lived or visited there can attest to the differences inherent in roads built before the age of the auto , where pedestrians are considered important road users. The road design, the topography, and the presence of people on foot demand drivers’ attention. “You see more distraction happening when people are more familiar with roads,” McMahon says. The type of car also may matter a lot. In the US, the CMT analysis notes , 94 percent of car drivers said they were driving cars with automatic transmissions. Only 33 percent of UK drivers answered the same. Manual shifting requires more active engagement with the vehicle. It’s also possible that Americans are getting more comfortable with risk precisely because their vehicles keep getting safer for the people driving them (if not for people outside of them ). “We’ve got all these safety features,” Shadel Fischer says. They convince drivers that “‘everything is fine! The car will take care of me, no big deal.’ They overestimate what those safety features are designed to do.” Another challenge is that there are frequently no negative consequences for using your phone while driving. It’s easy for people to do because they’ve done it before with no problem — until it causes a crash. What could make drivers put down their phones? A tech industry giant genuinely interested in improving lives and mitigating the harm and disruption caused by its products could find a way to disable distracting devices, leaving them available only for, say, GPS and emergency calls. “I’m convinced that the solution is the technology,” Shadel Fischer says. “We shouldn’t have to do anything.” Apple introduced a feature to the iPhone in 2017 that automatically puts the phone in “do not disturb” mode while driving, but it’s extremely easy to turn off. So we are left mostly with interventions into individual behavior. On the policy front, activists like Jennifer Smith, whose mother was killed in Oklahoma in 2008 by a driver talking on his cellphone, have been working with states to pass laws to end distracted driving. Forty- four states have some sort of distracted driving laws on the books, and 27 states have bans on hand-held cellphone use. In the distracted driving report, Cambridge Mobile Telematics looked at how driver behavior changed after a state passed a “hands-free” law and found that it led to a 13 percent reduction in phone motion while driving in the first three months after a law took effect. But those changes tended to diminish over time, and there’s wide variation among the states both in terms of public awareness of the laws and traffic enforcement, which declined in some states during the pandemic . Without high public awareness or enforcement — which is difficult to do well because it relies on law enforcement officers witnessing the distracted driving and enforcing the laws equitably — getting good compliance can be difficult. That’s why policymakers are taking a multi-pronged approach to the issue, trying to find ways to educate the public and make the laws enforceable. “It will take a long, sustained effort to change driver behavior if we want to have fewer deaths in this country,” says Michelle May, manager of the Highway Safety Program at Ohio’s Department of Transportation. Ohio’s “hands-free” law went into effect last year; since then, May says, the state has used telematics data and tracked an 8.1 percent decline in driver distractions. But May expects the effort to reduce phone use while driving will be a long-term effort, akin to the effort to reduce drunk driving and getting people to wear seatbelts. Financial incentives can also help. Car insurance rates have skyrocketed in recent years, becoming a leading cause of inflation and contributing to the financial burdens associated with car ownership , which disproportionately affects low-income and working-class Americans. The use of telematics-based apps by insurance companies offers drivers an opportunity to save money on their insurance rates. Research into the use of the apps suggests that drivers who regularly receive feedback on their driving habits tend to use their phones less while driving. The data can also help state departments of transportation better locate areas with more distracted driving, which could in turn help influence road design. “We’ve found that simple things like using paint to narrow the lanes gives people the illusion that they’ve got to slow down,” Shadel Fischer says. “The road design does play a role in how we act.” In other words, there are ways to address the problem but they rely heavily on a bunch of solutions working with one another, at a time when our road safety system appears to be breaking down. “Every single piece has to work in concert with the other or it won’t be successful because we’re up against such a huge scale of a behavioral problem,” Smith says. The stakes couldn’t be higher, though, and getting this right will undoubtedly take some combination of policy intervention, industry investment, and a willingness among drivers to put their phones down and pay attention. Until then, the status quo is an advanced country with incredibly high rates of road death, where, over time, almost everyone will know someone who lost their life in a car crash. “Somehow, we’re just accepting 42-45,000 people in the US dying in this manner every year,” McMahon says. “It’s preventable.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","This week, Russian forces made their most significant breakthrough in nine months — but at a heavy cost. They took the small Eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka , ending a brutal battle that has been raging since October . While undoubtedly a setback for Ukraine, the fall of Avdiivka was not an unambiguous victory for Russia . Ukrainian military commanders estimate that 47,000 Russians were killed or injured in the battle, which is significantly higher than the pre-war population of Avdiivka of around 32,000. The estimated death toll in the battle, 17,000, would be higher than the Soviet army’s during the 10-year war in Afghanistan . Those numbers are impossible to verify and very possibly exaggerated, but there’s no doubt the losses were exceedingly high and that this is a point of sensitivity for the Russian government. (This week, a pro-war Russian military blogger died reportedly by suicide after being forced to remove a post criticizing military commanders for the high casualties sustained in the battles.) Britain’s Ministry of Defense also estimates the Russians lost more than 400 tanks in the battle. Given those losses, it’s natural to wonder whether Avdiivka — not even one of the larger cities in Donetsk province, much less Ukraine — was a Pyrrhic victory for the Russians. Yes, in both Bakhmut and Avdiivka, the Russians demonstrated that with enough time, artillery ammunition, and human lives, they can take a small Ukrainian city, almost entirely demolishing it in the process. But is this a sustainable strategy for victory over the second-largest country, in terms of land area, in Europe? “I do not think it’s sustainable, but it is what I think that they’ll do,” retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commander of the US Army in Europe, told Vox, saying the war would come down to whether Ukraine could count on continued Western support. “They’ll do it because they can see that we are starting to waver.” The key factor when it comes to understanding Avdiivka is not so much size, location, or strategic significance, but timing. The loss comes at a time when international support for Ukraine, particularly in the United States, is starting to fade. It raises stark questions about what it will take from Kyiv and its international backers to keep Ukraine in the fight. The Ukrainians may be able to stabilize the front line in the coming months, but without significant additional support, Avdiivka is unlikely to be the last city to fall. How significant of a victory is Avdiivka? Avdiivka was “not a mere symbolic Russian victory,” said Franz- Stefan Gady, an Austrian military analyst with the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), who travels regularly to the front lines in Ukraine. The town lies less than 10 miles from the Russian-held city of Donetsk, the capital of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. The loss will put the city much farther out of range for any future Ukrainian counteroffensive. “Ukraine is losing an important strongpoint that anchored Ukrainian defenses in the area. It could potentially open up new avenues of attack for Russian forces,” Gady added. vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page . Subscribe Analysts also pointed out, though, that given the exhaustion of Russian troops after taking the city, they would be unlikely to be able to press further into Ukrainian-held territory. In a recent assessment, the Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces would likely be able to set up new defensive positions just a few miles beyond the city, forcing the Russian offensive to culminate here. “Battlefield results are measured in the ability to turn a local success into a bigger one,” Mykola Bielieskov, an analyst with the Kyiv-based National Institute for Strategic Studies, told Vox. “The Russians won’t be able to do that after pushing us out of Avdiivka. They lack reserves and have been exhausted from a five-month fight.” But even though Kyiv and its foreign backers don’t publicize Ukrainian casualty numbers, it’s clear the Ukrainians took heavy losses as well. A recent New York Times account based on interviews with Ukrainian troops describes a chaotic retreat from the city in which hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers may have been captured. Unverified images on social media show some of these prisoners being executed. The outcome is likely to contribute to already serious morale problems at the front and add to Ukraine’s difficulty in recruiting new troops. Avdiivka was a long and draining fight for both sides, and though it’s likely the Russian losses in the battle were far greater, Ukraine may have less of an ability to absorb those losses. Ukraine’s hunger for shells The battle for Avdiivka may have taken place in the fields surrounding the city, but the road to defeat may well have started in Washington, DC. Experts have been warning for months that unless the US Congress allocates new military aid to Ukraine — the last American aid package was sent in December — Ukraine would start to lose the ability to defend the 1,500-kilometer front line. The biggest problem is artillery ammunition: Last summer, Ukraine was firing more artillery shells than Russia per month. Now with supply shortages, it is firing less than a fifth of what the Russians can put out, according to Britain’s Royal United Services Institute. “If you don’t have shells, then courage alone will not be enough to win,” said Yehor Cherniev, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament and deputy chair of its national security committee. Cherniev said it was “cynical” of opponents of military aid to point to losses like Avdiivka as evidence that Ukraine can’t win. “First, they don’t give Ukraine shells, and then they lament that it has lost a populated area and claim that Russia cannot be defeated,” he said. The White House has placed the blame for the defeat squarely on congressional Republicans. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters in a call on Monday that Avdiivka was not lost because Ukrainian troops lacked skill or training: “It was because of congressional inaction. We’ve been warning Congress that if they didn’t act, Ukraine would suffer losses on the battlefield, and here you go. That’s what happened this weekend.” Avdiivka may be only a sign of things to come if aid does not resume. Last week, the Senate overwhelmingly passed an aid package that included military funding for Ukraine as well as Israel and Taiwan, and though previous aid packages have passed with substantial majorities, it’s not clear if the bill will even come up for a vote in the GOP-controlled House, given former president and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s public opposition to more aid. Asked by Vox if Ukraine could continue to rely on US support for the long term, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), a leading advocate of Ukraine aid, replied, “I don’t know. We were all together just a year ago, but Trump is causing Republicans to walk away from Ukraine. I think everybody should be worried. This [US] election will be definitive as to whether or not Ukraine survives.” Republican critics of aid, such as Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), counter that no amount of US aid could turn the tide given Russia’s overwhelming advantages in terms of soldiers and industrial capacity. “The West doesn’t make enough munitions to support an indefinite war. Ukraine doesn’t have enough manpower to support an indefinite war,” he told Politico on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference this week. It is true that Ukraine’s forces face significant personnel shortages, and that the government has been reluctant to pass controversial legislation that would expand conscription and crack down on draft dodging. “They have failed to make the necessary political decisions to do this,” said Hodges. “I think not only is that a problem for them on the battlefield, but it also will begin to undermine some Western support.” The task ahead Stabilizing the front lines after the withdrawal from Avdiivka will be an early test for Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi , who took over as commander of Ukraine’s armed forces this month. In recent days, the Russians have been concentrating forces for what appears to be an attempt to break through Ukraine’s lines in another area by retaking territory around the southern city of Robotyne, one of the rare successes of Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive. “One of the problems with the end of Ukraine’s counteroffensive is that much of the terrain that was seized was not particularly defensible terrain,” the analyst Rob Lee wrote on Twitter . CNAS’s Gady said it’s likely there could be “more tactical withdrawals in the coming weeks,” as Ukrainian commanders work to stabilize the situation. Beyond the next few weeks, 2024 is likely to be a rebuilding year for Ukraine, as they restore battered units, train new ones, and wait for more aid to arrive. European ammunition production is finally starting to ramp up , though at a much slower rate than Ukrainians hoped last year. The US reportedly has artillery systems and ammunition ready to send to Ukraine immediately if and when Congress approves funding, and is also leaning toward supplying long- range ATACMS missiles, which it has so far declined to send, and which the Ukrainians say will give them a better ability to disrupt Russian supplies and logistics. As bleak as the picture has often been on land in recent months, the Ukrainians have been having better luck on the Black Sea , where the bulk of the Russian fleet has been pushed back by Ukrainian missile and drone strikes and where Ukrainian grain exports by ship are back to near pre-war levels . As promising as those developments may be, this is ultimately a war over territory that comes down to Ukraine’s ability to defend it. Russia has its own supply issues, which forced it to recently begin purchasing mass quantities of ammunition from North Korea , and has also been reluctant to call a second mass mobilization to bring more troops to the front. But Russia’s ability to sustain heavy losses also shouldn’t be underestimated. A recent analysis from the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated that even after losing around 8,800 fighting vehicles in the war so far, Russia will probably still be able to sustain its assault on Ukraine at current attrition rates for another two to three years. It’s clear that this will be a much longer war and a contest of industrial capacity and political will as much as military maneuvers. But even getting to that marathon will require Ukraine getting past a very difficult period in the coming months. Gady said a complete collapse of Ukraine’s defenses was not entirely out of the question, but still unlikely: “There are going to be a couple months where the situation is really dire for Ukraine, but I think they can hold.” This story appeared originally in Today, Explained , Vox’s flagship daily newsletter.

"2","Reader, you can relax: They nailed it. Halfway through the third episode of Netflix’s tremendously anticipated live-action adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender , we’re treated to a slickly choreographed fight through a town square between our title character, Aang (Gordon Cormier), and his self- declared nemesis, Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu). This hand-to-hand combat through a colorful, chaotic street scene ends not with a victor but with a different coup de grâce: a cameo from a fan-favorite produce vendor wailing over his ruined cabbages . Between the rocky history of the franchise and uncertainty about the current production, fans’ anxiety around this Netflix release might well be at an all-time high . The previous attempt to adapt Nickelodeon’s beloved animated show, which ran for three seasons from 2005 to 2008, for a mainstream live-action audience resulted in infamy. M. Night Shyamalan’s 2010 movie sparked a notorious controversy over his decision to cast his main characters with white actors, a move that resulted in years-long protests from fans and contributed to the movie being released to utter ignominy . A gutsy 2012 series expansion following the exploits of Aang’s successor, Korra, renewed the franchise, though it garnered plenty of controversy in its own right for featuring a (gasp!) messy female protagonist. With so many fans still burned by the film, the news of Netflix’s eight-episode live-action adaptation spawned plenty of worry. That wasn’t helped when the original show’s creators, Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, walked away from the project in 2020, two years after it was first announced. Between their departure and the delays caused by the pandemic, fans wondered whether the show would even be released at all. The wait, it turns out, has been worth it. Although there are plenty of things to quibble with in successor showrunner Albert Kim’s version of the series, so many things go right that this adaptation of Avatar not only rejuvenates the whole franchise but elevates Netflix’s flagging live-action project. I am unabashedly Avatar -pilled; I think the Nickelodeon original is one of the greatest TV shows ever made . It pulls off in just three seasons the kind of epic world building and character evolution that shows double its length never manage to achieve. It does so by balancing its family-friendly ethos with a story that deals openly with war, genocide, fascism, trauma, and child abuse. The result is a show that’s routinely as devastating as it is delightful. Our heroes each grapple with deep personal loss while trying to stop a powerful military force, the Fire Nation, from colonizing the rest of the world. That world is inhabited by fantasy creatures, steampunk cities, and four distinct groups characterized by their relationship to the traditional four elements: besides the Fire Nation (inspired by imperial Japan, China, and other East Asian cultures), there is the Water Tribe (inspired by Inuit and other subarctic cultures), the Earth Kingdom (inspired by imperial Chinese culture), and the Air Nomads (inspired by Buddhist and Hindu cultures in Tibet and parts of Southeast Asia). Among these tribes, people known as benders can control the element they’re associated with. Only one human, known as the Avatar, has the ability to master all four elements — an ability passed down to them through generations in an unbroken chain of previous avatars. The disappearance of the most recent Avatar, Aang, a century ago has allowed the Fire Nation to lay waste to the other nations, including completely wiping out all the Air Nomads, the tribe into which Aang was born. Aided by Katara and Sokka, two Water Tribe siblings whose mother died in the Fire Nation’s ethnic cleansing and whose father is away at war, he has to make up for lost time and defeat the Fire Lord once and for all. This is heady stuff, especially for a kid’s cartoon. But the show, which won a Peabody for “adding thoughtful substance to [the] genre,” has the writing, creativity, and deep characterization to pull it off. That’s not to say that Avatar as a franchise and artistic product needs no reckoning with. The show’s status as an artifact of millennial nostalgia has become complicated over time. The degree to which its homage to anime and borrowing of Asian culture veers into cultural appropriation rather than tribute has been a source of debate among fans and critics. So has the degree to which, as a show made by white creators incorporating elements of colonized cultures, it reifies the very thing it attempts to rebuke. Still, unlike other shows of its time, Avatar has largely managed to hold on to its fans. This is partly because it’s never quite reached the mainstream. (In fact, its lack of a household name complicates things for us: Do we editorialize with the longstanding shorthand Avatar , which was preferred until it was usurped by James Cameron, forever turning it into “ Avatar — no, not that one”?) It’s also partly because Avatar remains one of the most unapologetically antifascist shows ever made. It’s not even generically pacifist — it frequently depicts acts of violent resistance as necessary. For all the time Aang spends proselytizing about things like morals, friendship, and the benefits of riding an air scooter , Avatar never resorts to empty platitudes; its moral and political lessons are usually hard-won. Complicated? Yes. But that’s also why, in the current political climate, a live-action remake of Avatar can’t afford a single ideological misstep. Its moral clarity about the absolute necessity of resisting genocidal regimes, political isolationism, and governments of conquest matters now more than ever. At their core, both the original and the new Avatar are travelogues — stories that evolve their characters and their universe through a literal journey through that universe. It’s a format shared by countless works, including fantasies ranging from Gulliver’s Travels to Star Trek . This works on multiple levels, expanding our understanding of the world while also allowing our characters to grow and change through each interaction with a new culture. The animated Avatar’s three seasons follow three phases of Aang’s journey to master all four elements, after which he can hopefully defeat the Fire Nation. The first season of Netflix’s adaptation faithfully aligns with the first season of the show (“Book One”) — though because it has to truncate much of the action, the first two episodes feature a lot of clunky exposition. The new show also suffers from a tendency to repeat the exposition we’ve already heard, to the extent of showing flashbacks to moments that happened earlier in the same episode . At times, the combination of overexposition and overmoralizing turns hokey. Still, the writing is stronger and more enjoyable than these choices imply. Netflix’s Avatar preserves the original’s plot, and its changes work to tighten the narrative, deepen characterization, and strengthen the impact of heart-clenching moments in the storyline. Crucially, it retains the balance of the original: depth and darkness, levity and light. The production design is opulent and rich with detail, carefully incorporating Avatar’s cultural influences, from architecture to costuming . The CGI is primarily an unobtrusive enhancement rather than a distraction (Appa the sky bison being a disappointing exception). The action is backed by a lush, beautiful score, and the fight scenes are excellent. The artificial nature of the CGI fight scenes was one of the things that really torpedoed Shyamalan’s version; here, however, particularly during all of the waterbending fights, the CGI and the live-action choreography integrate seamlessly, generating visually spectacular climactic battle sequences. Paul Sun-Hyung Lee and Dallas Liu as General Iroh and his nephew, Prince Zuko. Courtesy of Netlix All of this bolsters the impeccable casting decisions that went into creating this ensemble, which features cameos from a host of geek faves like Danny Pudi, Arden Cho, George Takei, and Osric Chau but never feels like pandering or stunt casting. Overall, this Avatar manages to avoid succumbing to “ the Netflix look ” and instead serves as an exemplar of how to cast and visually adapt animated characters without looking ridiculous or feeling fake. The standouts in this regard are exactly who they should be: Zuko, the willful, stubborn Fire Nation prince in exile, and his uncle, General Iroh ( The Mandalorian ’s Paul Sun- Hyung Lee). No Avatar adaptation can succeed unless the audience invests in this relationship; luckily for us, Dallas Liu exudes just the right mix of brashness and vulnerability and restless energy from the first moment he’s onscreen, while Lee unveils Iroh’s layered complexity one careful degree at a time. If one or the other doesn’t break your heart individually, the two of them together definitely will. Kiawentiio, who plays our waterbending heroine Katara, is so much better than everyone around her for most of her time onscreen that she inadvertently highlights how little attention her character gets. Book One focuses on developing her much less interesting older brother, Sokka. In the hands of actor Ian Ousley, who plays him with precise smarm and hamminess, Sokka is the epitome of the wisecracking sidekick: You either love him or hate him. Given all the material this season has to cover, the time we spend watching him chase cute girls and debate what career track he should be on feels like filler — especially since, by contrast, Katara is dealing (mostly offscreen) with the trauma of having watched her mother be burned alive . By the end, however, Katara gets her moment, with Sokka in full support. Eclipsed by so many bright and colorful side characters and a plot that gives his archnemesis the centerpiece hero’s journey, Aang has never been the most compelling part of his own story. For most of Book One, he’s still a naive 12-year-old who spends most of his time fleeing Fire Nation soldiers instead of learning to bend elements. Here, Gordon Cormier does his best, but he’s usually saddled with a mouthful of either moralism or exposition. The show also suffers from a failure to integrate Aang into the trio; we spend far more time hearing Aang and Katara talk at each other about the importance of friendship than we do watching them actually become friends. Because so many of these weaknesses are imposed on the series by the constraints of the eight- episode Netflix format, it’s worth asking whether we even need more Avatar . Can this shortening really do justice to the original’s complex themes? For me, so far, the answer is yes. It turns out I did need more from this story. I did need to see Cormier’s face collapsing in grief and love when he reunites briefly with the monk who raised him. I did need the show to retcon a tiny offscreen romance in order to show us that the conservative earthbending city of Omashu was quite literally built on a lesbian relationship. I did need Zuko’s soldiers dramatically saluting him because they’ve finally realized he’s had their backs all along. I definitely needed to see Katara ice-surf during a battle to prove her worth as a bender. Is it perfect? Nah. But it might be a perfect way to rekindle your love for Avatar — and remind the world why it deserved to be remembered in the first place. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","In December 2023, I had surgery to remove my fibroids. Fibroids are benign tumors that grow in the uterine wall. I’d had the growths for nearly a decade and, even though they were benign, they certainly added difficulty to my life. Heavy periods had plagued me since I was a teenager, but they had gotten worse as I’d gotten older. They often lasted over a week, leaving me tired and anemic. Often my cramps were so bad they made me nauseous. I went through pads and tampons quickly, and often worried that sneezing or coughing or laughing at the wrong time would lead to an embarrassing leak and a day with a jacket tied around my waist. Fibroids grow over time and new ones form. Over the years, my doctor found another sizable fibroid, and the one they first found had grown so large that it pressed on my stomach, leading to almost daily heartburn. Four months later, I got approved for a laparoscopic myomectomy, a surgery to have the fibroids removed. I woke up in the hospital groggy from anesthesia and sore from the five incisions the surgeon made, but excited for my new fibroid-free life. I later found out that I had more than two fibroids: they removed 10 in total, and the largest had grown to 15 centimeters — about the size of a mango. It’s a familiar story, but despite the answers and clarity my myomectomy gave me, it’s also a mysterious one for a lot of people with uteruses. As many as 77 percent of women will have fibroids in their lifetimes, but we don’t know what causes them. This also means that we don’t know what’s behind fibroids’ racial disparities. Black women are more likely to experience symptoms because of their fibroids, and they are two to three times more likely to have them reoccur once they’re removed. We’re also more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age. Doctors have theories about why that is. Some researchers think genetics are a factor; others think it could be chemicals we come in contact with. And some think it could be a phenomenon known as weathering . Weathering is a term coined by researcher Arline Geronimus . It was not without controversy when it was first introduced, but more of the medical community points to it as a factor for a number of health disparities for Black Americans. Dr. Uché Blackstock, the founder and CEO of Advancing Health Equity, explores this and other systemic failings of the health care system in her book Legacy: A Black Physician Reckons with Racism in Medicine . “Essentially, it’s this idea that dealing with the chronic stress of everyday racism causes a wear and tear on our bodies that prematurely ages us,” she says. “That actually makes us as Black folks susceptible to developing chronic diseases like heart disease, like autoimmune diseases, and also like fibroids.” In an episode of The Weeds , I sat down with Dr. Blackstock to discuss weathering, how racism has impacted medical care past and present, and what solutions could create more equity in health care. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to The Weeds on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you get podcasts. Jonquilyn Hill What role does weathering play in the health of Black people? Uché Blackstock Basically almost every health outcome, we do very poorly. And it’s not because there is anything inherently wrong with us, but there is something very wrong with the social systems that we live in. This idea of weathering is so important for us to talk about because it may seem covert to some people, but there is a stress that we live with every day that actually wears down our bodies. And that’s something that we need to be aware of in how it factors into us developing other diseases. Jonquilyn Hill What does stress do to the body? We all hear that adage “ Black don’t crack .” Maybe people look younger, but our bodies are telling us a different story. Uché Blackstock We know that Black birthing people have a higher cortisol level than their white peers — about 15 percent higher . Cortisol is a stress hormone. That’s the hormone that goes up when you are in a fight-or-flight response. The problem is that hormones should not be consistently high. It should go up and as needed come back down. But with Black folks, because we have to go through the stress of living in essentially a racist society, our cortisol levels are consistently high. That causes an increase in our heart rate, a stress on our heart, and an increase in blood pressure. There’s also another idea called epigenetics , the study of gene expression and what happens when people are stressed. And there is also a correlation that because of the stress that we live with due to racism, that causes a change in how genes are expressed. So while race is a social construct and it’s not biological, how we experience racism can turn on and off genes. And we think that has some implication into why Black folks are more likely to develop diabetes, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases like heart disease or atherosclerosis, and infant mortality. When you compare the ends of our DNA — those are called telomeres. When you look at our telomeres, Black people and other people of color, our telomeres are shorter. They actually look like they belong to people several decades older. So again, race is a social construct, [there’s] no biological basis for it. But the impact of racism in practices and policies and interpersonal interactions actually has an impact on our DNA. Jonquilyn Hill I would love to dig into some more data around how these disparities work. There was this really interesting example you’ve talked about when it comes to Black immigrants. Uché Blackstock When Black immigrants come to the United States, their health status is on par with white Americans. But what happens is after one to two generations, their health status actually declines to that of Black Americans . So what that tells you is that there is something very wrong with the forces that Black people are subjected to just living in this country, that our health status could decline after one or two generations from that of white Americans to Black Americans. There’s nothing inherently wrong with Black people. There is something very, very wrong with the systems that we are forced to live under or within. And that is what is accounting for this decline in life expectancy, we have some of the lowest life expectancy of any racial demographic group. Jonquilyn Hill What’s on your policy wish list? What do you think would lead to better health care and better outcomes for Black patients? Uché Blackstock I think a lot of the solutions have to happen at multiple levels. They have to happen within medical schools, how medical schools are educating our future physicians. Not just including the history, but understanding how what we call the social determinants of health, education, employment, free access to healthy foods, green space, all of that impacts health. So getting medical students more of a holistic education as to how people can stay healthy and how they get sick. For hospitals, it’s really their obligation to keep track in real time of health equity metrics to see, are there differences in how our patients are being treated compared to white patients? Are there differences in prescribing habits? I was working with one ER where Black patients were waiting 80 minutes longer to be admitted to the hospital than white patients. And we talked about actually developing standardized processes to keep track of that and then to make interventions if necessary. And for policymakers, I want them to think about health in all policies. We know that because of the legacy of slavery, because of discriminatory housing policies, our communities have been deprived of wealth and resources and opportunities. So when we think about opportunities for home ownership, for building wealth, when we think about education and how we can provide our children with a free, quality public education, all of that is incredibly important to making our communities healthier. Jonquilyn Hill Does the political will to get these things done exist? Uché Blackstock We’ve got to put the pressure on our electeds to say this is a priority for us. In 2024, why is it less safe for a Black birthing person to give birth than it was 20 years ago ? That does not make any sense, but it does show how deeply embedded racism is in our society. And it’s unacceptable, the fact that we have worse maternal outcomes than other high- income countries and even some middle-income countries and we spend even more on health care than they do. Jonquilyn Hill For those of us, and in particular Black women who have to navigate the health care system as it exists today, what are some things we can do to make it as safe as possible for ourselves? Uché Blackstock This is always a hard question for me because it’s the system. It shouldn’t be up to us, and it shouldn’t be up to Black women to have to feel like we’re going to war when we are at our most vulnerable and seeking care. But obviously, there are some things I always advise people to do. There was this viral TikTok video recently by a white health professional who said, why are all my Black patients on FaceTime with someone when I come into the room? It’s because we don’t trust you. I always recommend people either bring a trusted friend or a loved one to an appointment. It could be for moral support. It could be to help you ask questions. Also document your symptoms. When did the pain start? When did the symptoms start? How long has it been? Make sure that you have everything written down because often during appointments you can get very nervous. Ask your doctor or health professionals, what do you think is going on? What is your plan for me? What is the follow-up? What are red flags where I should come back or seek care or go to the ER? But also just know that Black women, we are doing amazing things. Like there’s Health in Her Hue , which is a digital startup run by Ashlee Wisdom, and that is a directory of Black health professionals and culturally responsive health professionals who are trained to work with Black women patients. There is the Irth app , also started by a Black woman, which is a directory of maternal health providers that specifically work with Black birthing people. So we’re the ones also that are creating the solutions to make the health care system more accessible and respectful to us. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","The story of the North Atlantic right whale, an icon of the East Coast, should be one of hope — a tale of recovery. Humanity’s strongest tools have been mobilized for their protection. For centuries, whalers hunted these graceful giants, which were once found throughout the North Atlantic, for their baleen and oily blubber. By the early 20th century, they were nearly extinct. But in 1935, alarmed by the shrinking number of right whales, international authorities banned commercial hunting of these animals. Decades later, as North Atlantic right whales were starting to recover, the US gave them another lifeline, listing them as endangered under the Endangered Species Act . That made killing or harming them a federal crime. On paper, these whales were — and still are — highly protected. The US and Canadian governments also invest millions into their conservation, as do nonprofit environmental groups. Yet they continue to perish, often tragically. Since summer 2017, more than 120 North Atlantic right whales have died, been seriously injured, or fallen sick, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Many deaths have likely gone undocumented, experts say. Today, officials estimate that there are just 360 of these animals left, down from a historic population that was likely in the tens of thousands, making them one of the most endangered whales on the planet. “North Atlantic right whales are approaching extinction,” NOAA has warned . The problem is no longer whaling. What’s killing these animals today is certain fishing and shipping practices — and the people and politicians who enable them. Lines of rope attached to crab and lobster traps are ensnaring right whales, slowly digging into their bodies over months and even years, often until they die. Fishing boats and container ships, meanwhile, are accidentally ramming into the marine giants, which are known to cruise near the surface. If you don’t fish or live far from the East Coast, this may seem like a distant concern, one to comfortably ignore. Yet most Americans are implicated in the demise of these whales if they buy goods shipped in from overseas or eat lobster, Michael Moore , a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told Vox. “The wants and needs of today’s consumers indirectly and unintentionally precipitate vessel strikes and entanglement of whales and are the ultimate cause of the death of these animals,” Moore, one of the nation’s foremost right whale experts, wrote in a recent paper . A right whale seen feeding near Duxbury Beach in Massachusetts, just south of Boston. David L. Ryan/Boston Globe via Getty Images The story of the right whale is not only tragic but it reveals a flaw in modern environmental policies: They don’t work well when they run against consumerism and convenience, when they require industries and consumer behavior to change. It’s not that solutions to saving North Atlantic right whales don’t exist. They do — and as I’ll explain, they’re extremely simple. It’s that the economy of the US and elsewhere prioritizes cheap products over the lives and welfare of wild animals. Why are so many of these whales dying? Earlier this year, a young female North Atlantic right whale washed up dead on Martha’s Vineyard. She was thin. Somewhat gruesome images show thick rope sticking out of a large wound near her tail. A preliminary necropsy showed “chronic entanglement” and an analysis of the rope linked it to a fishery in Maine. This case was bleak. The animal, the only known calf of a whale called Squilla, had been entangled for more than a year . But these circumstances are not uncommon. Entanglements are a leading cause of death for North Atlantic right whales, according to government authorities and independent scientists. Most of that rope likely comes from lobster and crab fisheries, in Maine, eastern Canada, and elsewhere. Fishermen commonly use lines attached to buoys to mark and retrieve baited traps, which essentially turn large swaths of the North Atlantic into a minefield for whales. A female North Atlantic right whale trailing fishing line, seen on December 30, 2010. She died in early 2011. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, NOAA Permit #594-1759 via AP Entanglement is an “utter nightmare” for these animals, as Moore, a veterinarian who’s examined more than 40 dead North Atlantic right whales, wrote in his 2021 book We Are All Whalers . Here’s how he explained it in the book: Hitting a line makes them panic, and they tend to spin, trying to evade it, but instead they get multiple wraps of line around various body parts, such as the upper jaw, flippers, and tail. If they cannot disentangle themselves, the wraps construct through time and slowly squeeze the life out of the animal over a matter of months. More than 85 percent of right whales have been entangled in fishing gear at least once, according to NOAA. And whales that die from entanglement are ensnared, on average, for six months, Moore’s older research shows . It’s hard to see this as anything other than brutal. Short of killing the whales, chronic entanglement also makes it hard for these animals to feed (by gulping up large mouthfuls of plankton, which they filter through their baleen) and have babies. Wrapped around their bodies, rope not only stresses out the animals but causes drag, meaning whales expend more energy swimming, eating into valuable fat stores. North Atlantic right whales were once able to produce a calf every three years, Moore said, but now it happens just once every six or seven years, on average. A 1-year-old female North Atlantic right whale that was found dead near Savannah, Georgia, likely after getting hit by a ship. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, NOAA permit #24359 The other major problem for these animals is fast-moving and abundant boats. North Atlantic right whales are slow swimmers that spend a lot of time at the ocean’s surface, where they catch their breath and socialize, making them especially vulnerable to strikes. These events, like entanglement, are not uncommon. Earlier this month, for example, a young female right whale, shown above, was found dead near Savannah, Georgia. She had a fractured skull, experts determined, which was consistent with a vessel strike. More than a dozen North Atlantic right whales have died from similar collisions in the last five years. The GIF below shows all of the ships (blue dots) that a single whale (red dot) has to contend with. Even small boats — such as sportfishing vessels, which take people fishing recreationally, or research ships — can cause serious injuries or death . Researchers track the movement of a young right whale as it dodges ships off the East Coast in March 2021. NOAA Fisheries (The noise produced by ships can also be a problem . It likely makes it harder for whales to communicate with each other, though it’s not clear what that means for their long-term survival.) There are clear solutions, yet the US has failed to implement them What scientists and environmental advocates I spoke to find especially frustrating is that much of this problem could be solved if fishers had the right incentives and support. “We know exactly what we have to do,” Moore said. “The science is all there.” Take, for example, entanglement. The problem, again, is rope that runs from a buoy on the surface to traps on the seafloor. Yet the fishing industry has the technology to catch lobsters and crabs without it. Various forms of ropeless gear, also known as on-demand technology, allow fishing boats to find and retrieve pots wirelessly — meaning they don’t need a buoyed line, visible from the sea surface, to find their catch and reel it in. A small number of fishers have started using these ropeless systems. Others are resisting change , for many reasons. On-demand gear is likely less reliable compared to traps made of rope and metal; more parts can fail. There are also concerns related to visibility. If there are no surface buoys to mark a trap, bottom trawlers might have a harder time avoiding them. “I think the fear is it would create more problems amongst each other just fishing,” Dave Casoni, a longtime lobster fisher, told NPR’s Lauren Sommer. “It’s a very busy, dangerous operation to begin with, and we don’t need to add that.” Then there’s the question of cost. Ropeless gear raises the cost of lobstering — the devices themselves are expensive, and these systems can slow down the speed of trapping . A dead right whale on the beach on Miscou Island, New Brunswick, Canada, on June 7, 2019. Nathan Klima/Boston Globe via Getty Images A dead young right whale near Tybee Island, Georgia, on February 14, 2024. Georgia Department of Natural Resources via AP Yet these challenges are fixable. NOAA is testing on-demand gear to iron out the technical issues. Plus, the government has allocated millions of dollars to these technologies and currently lends them out for free to fishermen. The longer-term goal, NOAA told Vox, is “to expand capacity to support all fishermen wishing to trial on- demand gear and, eventually, an experimental fishery encompassing many more participants.” What that ultimately means for the costs assumed by fishers — and the costs passed down to consumers — is not yet clear. “If the motivation is there, the dollars will be too,” Moore said. A bigger issue, Moore said, might be shifting the deeply ingrained culture of the lobster industry in Maine toward a new way of doing things. Contributing to this tension: The industry has long downplayed its role in killing whales, obscuring who ultimately feels responsible. After NOAA linked the dead right whale to the Maine fishery earlier this year, the Maine Lobstermen’s Association said that “entanglement in Maine gear is extremely rare.” The group, which advocates for the state’s lobster fishers, added that it “remains committed to finding a solution to ensure a future for right whales and Maine’s lobster fishery.” Moore says the risk of entanglement in these waters is significant, and until recently, it was challenging to trace gear back to Maine fisheries. Efforts to address ship strikes have been similarly sluggish. Once again, the solution is, at least on the surface, painfully clear: slow boats down. For more than a decade, NOAA has required that large ships (longer than 65 feet) reduce their speeds to 10 knots (~11.5 mph) in certain areas along the East Coast and at certain times of year to avoid whales. The agency also urges boats to avoid or slow down in areas where a handful of North Atlantic right whales have been detected. These rules are grossly inadequate, said Erica Fuller , an attorney at Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental group that advocates for whale conservation. A key problem, she said, is that “young animals continue to be killed by and seriously injured by boats that are smaller than 65 feet.” Plus, compliance with the current regulations is weak . In 2022, NOAA proposed new speed regulations that would apply to much smaller boats and across a much larger area of the ocean. These rules are an improvement, Fuller said, though she’s frustrated by how long it’s taking the government to adopt regulations that it knows are necessary. (Some special-interest groups, like the American Sportfishing Association, strongly oppose these changes. They have also questioned whether smaller boats are really harming whales.) A mom and calf near Wassaw Island, Georgia, on January 19, 2021. Georgia Department of Natural Resources/NOAA Permit #20556 via AP The true cost of consumer goods Protecting wild animals or ecosystems often requires giving something up. Stop hunting American alligators to save the American alligator. Don’t clear-cut old-growth forests to safeguard the northern spotted owl. This is not the case with North Atlantic right whales. We can save these animals and still eat lobster, and still get foreign-made goods at Walmart, and still go sportfishing. With technology like on-demand fishing gear, “you keep the fisherman fishing, and you can keep the whales swimming, entanglement-free,” said Erin Meyer-Gutbrod , an ocean scientist and right whale expert at the University of South Carolina. Fishing without rope and driving boats more slowly may make some of the products we love more expensive. But what are those extra dollars worth to us? Would you pay more for lobster if it meant that whales would suffer less? What if it meant saving a species from extinction? Maybe paying for food fished from the sea, from ecosystems that the US is trying to protect, should cost more. And it’s consumers who should be paying the difference, not fishers. Do you have feedback on this story or tips about fisheries and shipping? Get in touch with the author at benji.jones@vox.com . “Where the rubber hits the road is in the politics of and the expectations of voters,” Moore said. “What matters to them is dinner on the table, kids in college, houses warm, clothes to wear, Christmas presents to give — none of that includes anything about biodiversity or right whales.” In many ways, saving the North Atlantic right whale should be easy. These animals are charismatic and intelligent. People love to see them. We love whales! Most important of all, we know what’s killing them and what to do about it. But so far, that’s not enough. Ensuring the survival of these animals will ultimately require a change in our economy and in our personal behavior. Every consumer has a part to play in this reckoning: Pay the true cost.

"2","Before hitting the stage at this year’s Super Bowl Halftime Show , R&B; singer Usher graced the cover of Vogue’s 2024 Winter Digital issue . It wasn’t totally obvious, though, that he was meant to be the publication’s guest of honor. The styling is tasteful enough, with Usher dressed in a cream-colored, autumnal outfit like a fashion-forward sports dad. However, not only is he upstaged by a group of school-aged football players on the cover, he’s joined by supermodel Carolyn Murphy. Critics on X and TikTok quickly expressed their frustration over the direction of the shoot, which seemed intent on minimizing Usher’s presence. Along with Lebron James and Kanye West , he is one of less than a handful of Black men to be featured on US Vogue covers. (Maybe not so coincidentally, the three mentioned share their cover shoots with white women.) Then a few weeks later came a steamy underwear ad for Skims , Kim Kardashian’s shapewear and loungewear brand. Social media users praised Usher and Skims for the timely collaboration. The simple shoot, featured the “U Remind Me” singer, decked out in chains, holding a peach, and flaunting his six-pack abs while wearing briefs. It was received as a more rewarding press stop than the Vogue cover by many of his fans. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kim Kardashian (@kimkardashian) It’s safe to say that there’s no real challenger to the 131-year-old institution that is Vogue. Utilizing elite photographers and A-list designers — not to mention editor-in-chief Anna Wintour’s unwavering dominance in the fashion industry — the magazine has remained one of the ultimate curators of celebrity image. But it’s hard not to notice that Skims’ star-studded ads generate the kind of positive buzz that Vogue and other legacy magazine covers have frequently failed to achieve — and that are often met with controversy regarding poor photography , underwhelming styling , and a lack of diversity . Meanwhile, Skims shoots have seen a more consistently positive reception. Before Usher’s campaign, the e-commerce brand set social media ablaze with their annual Valentine’s Day campaign starring singer Lana Del Rey . And the holiday shoot the year before featured Beatrice Grannò and Simona Tabasco, two Italian actresses from the hit HBO series The White Lotus. They’ve also arrived at a time when celebrity endorsements and influencer sponcon have become an integral part of the online experience. It’s maybe not so surprising that the mastermind behind all of this is Kim Kardashian, a modern pinup with a penchant for opening our wallets and making things go viral. Skims put a “cool” stamp on shapewear. Since launching Skims in 2019, Kardashian’s juggernaut of a business, currently valued at $4 billion , has managed to give consumers a new outlook on body-sculpting innerwear. Leading up to its debut, Kardashian and her influencer sisters were controversially shilling waist trainers on social media. Presumably, the media moguls’ seal of approval helped shred some of the not-so-marketable associations with foundation garments. For most of the 2000s and 2010s, shapewear was largely a punchline, even with its not-so-secret widespread use throughout Hollywood and the fashion industry. Spanx were for imperfect women trying to conceal their love handles on a date. The word “girdle” still brings to mind an older demographic of women. Maybe the most telling sign that Spanx and other body-cincher products were aimed at an older generation of women was an early cosign by Oprah Winfrey . As the body-positivity movement has made strides over the past two decades — infiltrating marketing for just about everything, from dating apps to soap — the standard of physical perfection that made the use of body-cinching products embarrassing has started to dwindle. By the time Skims released its first set of inventory, it seemed like shapewear was something young women were not only comfortable admitting they owned but sporting as outerwear as well. It certainly helped that trendy labels like Mugler , Charlotte Knowles , and Rui Zhou (and their fast-fashion dupes) have repopularized slimming, paneled bodysuits and underwear-inspired clothes. The shapewear craze is apparently so huge that forecasters predict a market share of $3.8 billion in the next seven years. The impetus for Skims Solutionwear — initially controversially called “Kimono” — isn’t that different from shapewear founder Sara Blakely’s story . Blakely cut the legs of her control-top pantyhose to maintain a cinched look under her pants, creating what would essentially be the groundbreaking product Spanx. Kardashian similarly claims she was forced to cut her shapewear to complement her cutout and high-slit dresses. A more important selling point for the company, Kardashian also said she couldn’t find shapewear to match her olive-y tan skin tone, going so far as to dye her shapewear with tea and coffee . “For me, I was just looking for a solution to the fact that I love to wear shapewear,” Kardashian said at the Time 100 summit last year. “There wasn’t a color tone that fit my skin tone, let alone most of my friends.” A few years prior, Rihanna’s makeup brand Fenty Beauty proved that inclusivity — especially when paired with A-list celebrity branding — sells. Likewise, Skims relied heavily on the same message of diversity, with the slogan “solutions for every body.” Its 36-piece debut collection offered bras, underwear, shorts, and various bodysuits in nine shades from sand to onyx. Significantly, the brand offered an extensive size range, XXS to 5X, and used models representing that spectrum. In its first few minutes of launching, the brand made $2 million . You could liken the online response to [Skims ads] to older generations seeing their pop-culture idols in a “Got Milk?” ad or on a Wheaties cereal box Of course, branding shapewear designed to make the body look slimmer as “inclusive” is a bit ironic if not totally regressive. Still, it’s clear that millennial and Gen-Z women felt more embraced by Skims and other direct-to-consumer companies, like ThirdLove and Savage X Fenty, than legacy brand Victoria’s Secret by the late 2010s. Since about 2015, the lingerie retailer has seen a cultural and financial decline due to public controversies, decreasing sales, internal issues, and a general inability to keep up with the times. Things ultimately took a turn for the worse in 2018 when former Chief Marketing Officer of L Brands (which owns Victoria’s Secret) Edward Razek defended excluding plus-size and transgender models from the annually televised Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. Since then, the company has attempted more inclusive messaging , expanded its size range, and retained high-profile spokesmodels. However, sales, particularly its in-store performance , have continued to plunge. Celebrity Skims ads have filled a void in pop culture. Aside from the “inclusivity” angle, Skims has remained a dominant force in the fashion world thanks to its internet-breaking collaborations. In a short amount of time, the brand has linked up with high- fashion label Fendi for a capsule collection and sports organizations like the US Olympic team , the NBA , and the WNBA . Their campaigns featuring some of the internet’s most beloved celebrities have made Skims a premiere platform for viral photo shoots. You could liken the online response to a high-profile actor, athlete, or musician appearing in a Skims ad to older generations seeing their pop-culture idols in a government-sponsored “Got Milk?” ad or even a beloved athlete on a Wheaties cereal box. Commercials for Calvin Klein in the ’80s and ’90s, starring then-up-and-comers such as Mark Wahlberg and Brooke Shields, generated similar excitement if not controversy . In the social media era, when everyone is constantly self-promoting, celebrity photo shoots have lost a bit of their novelty. Still, Skims has managed to harness social media and the zeitgeist to deliver capital-M moments. Adrianne Pasquarelli, special projects editor and senior reporter for Ad Age, notes that timeliness is one aspect that works in Skims’ favor. She emphasizes that being a DTC brand helps Skims roll out these celebrity ads in a quicker fashion. “As a direct-to-consumer brand, they’re able to be very nimble with their marketing,” she said. “[Kim] handles a lot of the creative and can turn out that stuff on a dime, especially for a digital campaign. It’s harder to be as flexible and as fast with marketing for heritage companies with a bunch of brick-and-mortar stores and just decades of retailing.” It seems like Skims is doing something that legacy brands have struggled to deliver in the age of the internet: spotlight diverse talent in the right way at the right time and create the sort of impactful images that fans want. While Vogue has attempted to feature more people of color in and on the cover of their magazines — albeit at a slow pace — and Victoria’s Secret now caters to a larger range of bodies, these brands haven’t been able to totally shed the below-par reputation they’ve developed in the past or produce branding work that resonates with consumers. Some of Skims’ illustrious spokesmodels include SZA, Cardi B, the Mahomes family, Ice Spice, PinkPantheress, Kate Moss, Lana Del Rey, Snoop Dogg, Brooke Shields, and Rosalía. One of their most eye-catching photo shoots was appropriately named “ Icons ” and featured fashion and lingerie models such as Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks, Candice Swanepoel, and Alessandra Ambrosio, all of them previous Victoria’s Secret angels. Interestingly enough, Skims buyers called out Victoria’s Secret for allegedly copying the campaign with their “Icons Collection,” which similarly cast ’90s supermodels. Skims is doing something that legacy brands have struggled to: spotlight diverse talent in the right way at the right time So far, unlike Calvin Klein’s ads of yore, there’s hardly any controversy involved. For the most part, Skims’ photo shoots have yet to stir an overwhelmingly negative response. The company was briefly in hot water for featuring San Francisco 49ers player Nick Bosa in a Skims Men ad last year after some problematic tweets resurfaced. However, a short-lived, largely forgettable scandal is ironically a feat for Kardashian, whose name is practically synonymous with backlash. The shoots are all tastefully sexy and, in some cases — like with the Mahomeses — family-friendly. Rather than leaning into a hypersexualized, male gaze like Victoria’s Secret shoots, they rely on beauty, brand synergy, and the cultural climate rather than any attempts to truly shock or titillate — well, except maybe in the case of some of their men’s ads. Many of Skims’ splashier celebrity ads have also featured and targeted older adults. Solibran Stone, head of content marketing at influencer marketing company The Shelf, notes that older millennial and Gen X consumers have a more traditional, “old- school” idea of celebrity that Skims’ ads often hit upon. “I think Skims focuses on content for young consumers and campaigns for older consumers, which makes it accessible for everyone,” she said. For example, in one brilliant 2020 campaign, Kardashian unveiled Skims’ velour loungewear collection with the help of her best friend Paris Hilton. The girly, tabloid- style photo shoot shows the pair exiting a grocery store and walking through a parking lot, harkening back to their early socialite days being followed by paparazzi. The casual shoot wasn’t just leaning into Y2K aesthetic trends. It was also capitalizing on Hilton’s reemergence as a foregone cultural figure that millennials were beginning to appreciate again and Gen Z-ers were presumably becoming familiar with. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton) Stone says Skims has managed to reflect the interests of a wide range of consumers with its diverse casting. “If you don’t listen to hip hop, then you’ve got Kim Cattrall,” Stone said. “If you don’t know who SZA is or whatever — there’s someone standing in the gap who can loop you into that world.” We’re living in peak celebrity endorsement culture It can’t be overstated that Skims is a billion-dollar business because of the extremely famous founder Kim Kardashian, who’s constantly posting Skims products on Instagram to her 364 million followers. The company has also been a word-of-mouth success with many reluctantly praising the quality of its products. Of course, there have also been detractors, regarding its alleged unsustainability . “It does have to do with the extensive reach of Kim Kardashian,” Pasquarelli said. “She just commands a celebrity that a lot of others don’t. ” It’s fair to suggest that Skims’ ads also thrive because of the landscape of celebrity branding and sponcon that she helped foster. Of course, the Skims founder isn’t totally responsible for influencer marketing as a concept. Celebrity advertisements in the 1980s and ’90s really set the stage for much of what the scene looks like today, with Michael Jordan’s myriad brand deals and Pepsi and Coca-Cola commercials starring huge pop stars. Still, in 2024, there’s a noticeable level of excitement on social media when a celebrity collabs with a popular brand, and the partnership feels just right. Ben Affleck and his long-running, heavily memed relationship with Dunkin’ is a prime example. Ironically, his trilogy of Dunkin’ ads , the third one airing at this year’s Super Bowl , feels like the biggest cinematic event he’s partaken in recently. “I think the appeal of Ben Affleck for Dunkin’ is because of how much it plays into meme culture,” said Vulture writer Rebecca Alter, who writes about celebrity endorsements. “We’ve all seen images of Affleck looking exhausted fetching his Dunkies, and I think people find it really endearing and amusing when a celebrity plays into the meme image of themselves, because it’s an image that fans helped create.” Usher’s Skims campaign leaned into the sexy image he’s always projected himself but certainly amped up in recent years as the singer went viral for serenading his largely women guests at his Las Vegas residency. The same can be said about Lana Del Rey, who was somewhat of a surprising spokesmodel. Del Rey is more of a private figure and not particularly known for shilling anything aside from her albums and poetry books. But it seemed like her fans appreciated the direction of the shoot, a callback to the 1960s pinup look she’s embraced throughout her career. The photo shoot even earned Skims a whopping $13.7 million in media exposure. Ultimately, Skims’ success formula for advertising is admittedly simple; it’ll always have the ability to impress as long as other legacy brands are getting it wrong. Time will tell whether Skims can adapt to ever-changing trends in fashion and body image. But for now, it’s proven to be more agile and forward-thinking than your older sister’s lingerie shop or the glossy editorials resting in a pile on your mother’s nightstand.

"1","California Gov. Gavin Newsom is always focused on how he can ascend upward. That was true back when he was an elitist playboy in the 1990s who dated socialite Kelley Phleger and the singer Jewel for the clout it provided him in high-society San Francisco. And it’s true now as he seeks to leverage his time as California’s governor into the role of America’s president. Currently, the primary obstacle to Newsom’s ceaseless ambitions is an angry old man’s desire to cling to a job for which he lacks the mental capacity. Yet swiftly becoming equally obstructive to Newsom’s plans is the condition of California under his governance. In particular, the state’s $73 billion budget shortage threatens to slap a giant red mark on his leadership. The shortfall will serve as a warning: Gavin Newsom was given power over the nation’s wealthiest state, and he promptly wrecked that state’s finances. The estimated $73 billion shortfall was disclosed Tuesday by the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office. It represents an increase from that office’s earlier estimate of a $58 billion shortfall; the heightened projection resulted from California’s paltry income tax receipts in January. This $73 billion is an astronomical shortfall. To put it in perspective, Virginia’s total budget for fiscal year 2024 is $80.8 billion . Furthermore, California’s budget agreement for the 2023–2024 fiscal year called for $225.9 billion in spending , making the shortfall ginormous in proportion to California’s budget. And it gets worse: California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office projects deficits of at least $30 billion a year for fiscal years 2025–2026 and 2027–2028. The fault for California’s predicament lies entirely with Gavin Newsom. He has repeatedly spent exorbitantly on useless liberal goodies. For example, Newsom handed a $9 billion gift to public pensions; provided free health insurance to illegal immigrants ; burned billions of dollars on the bullet train to nowhere; wasted $12 billion on the worst-ever plan to fight homelessness; shilled out $51.4 billion to “climate projects”; provided two years of free community college ; and spent billions to increase the number of therapists in schools. Newsom did not care that the waste would create a ticking time bomb of fiscal disaster. The only thing that mattered to him was that the spending would temporarily make him a progressive champion. ***** Newsom is refusing to back down from his strategy of spend, spend, spend. In January, Newsom claimed — contra the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office — that the state only faced a budget shortfall of $38 billion. This week, Newsom trotted out a staffer to affirm that the governor still holds that the shortfall is $38 billion. Worse, Newsom is not seeking any significant decreases in spending to make up the difference. Instead, he wants to engage in budgetary trickery to keep his spending projects and push off judgement day until his successor takes over. For example, Newsom wants to allow schools to keep $8 billion of cash disbursements without, as the Legislative Analyst’s Office explains , “recognizing the budgetary impact of those payments.” In addition, Newsom wants to take funds from the state’s reserves to cover the shortfall. The problem is that this fund is intended for economic crises, and the reason for California’s budget shortfall is mostly out-of-control spending. If California’s reserves were spent before a major economic downturn, it could be catastrophic for the state because California’s tax money disproportionally comes from the wealthy, whose incomes are more sensitive to recession. In the event that Joe Biden pulls out of the presidential race prior to the convention because of his cognitive decline — which even big-name progressives are calling for — one of Newsom’s foremost competitors in winning the nomination from the party’s delegates would be Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Michigan currently has a $7.5 billion surplus , making Newsom’s inability to manage his state’s finances responsibly look even worse. Of course, wrecking California’s finances is far from the only disaster Newsom has inflicted on his state. Newsom has overseen a huge increase in California’s homelessness population ; a dramatic decline in California students’ learning outcomes; incredibly overbearing and insane COVID lockdowns and school closures; an increase in violence and property crime ; an exodus from the state; an unconstitutional restriction of religious liberty for months on end; and $32 billion in fraud against the state’s taxpayers. But the fact that the task for which Newsom is most directly responsible — setting California’s budget — has been so disastrous is especially alarming. In a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Tuesday, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul admonished Americans to “never, ever let Gavin Newsom anywhere near the White House.” Newsom’s glaring failure to manage California’s finances should serve as a stark warning that Paul’s impulse is exactly right."
"2","Centuries ago, those accused of gossip, primarily women, were locked into metal headpieces that restrained the mouth. Imagine what those medieval haters would think about Wendy Williams. The host first started rattling off her opinions into millions of American living rooms in 2008. But The Wendy Williams Show kicked off its 13th season in October 2021 without Williams as its host. And after months of delays and guest hosts, in September 2022 her slot was replaced by Sherri , hosted by Sherri Shepherd, the former The View co-host who had been Williams’s most popular fill-in. Now, after more than two years out of the spotlight and recently disclosing that she has been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia, Lifetime — which previously produced both a dramatization and a documentary about the talk show host’s life — is releasing the documentary Where Is Wendy Williams? The film, which premieres on February 24, appears to follow Williams through that difficult period and features interviews with her, her family, and other associates. The documentary is slated to give an inside look at her mental and physical health issues, as well as the drama surrounding her financial guardianship. On Instagram in 2022, Williams called out Wells Fargo , accusing the bank of “keeping her away” from her money. “Where is Wendy Williams?” is certainly a question her fans have been asking for a while now, as they find her pretty irreplaceable. At the end of her show’s run, Williams ranked among the top daytime talk show hosts, after Ellen DeGeneres , who ended her show in May 2022, and the women of The View . While Shepherd has received positive feedback, the lack of a goodbye from Williams has been met with concern and mixed feelings. For over a decade between smirking laughter and sips from her mug, Williams calmly eviscerated celebrity goings-on, razing their mishaps to the ground to lay at the feet of her live studio audience. She kept her original mission through changing times and through her own struggles. Even early on, her penchant for showing no mercy was documented by the New York Times in a 2008 article that described her as capable of being “startlingly mean-spirited.” This is what helped her amass a legion of fans, and also what irritated her critics for so long; toward the end of her talk show gig, the infractions piled up. The tide has turned on the kind of lurid gossip Williams traffics in; just look at the way the pop culture news cycle of the early aughts is being reevaluated. Still, her mix of bravado and vulnerability kept her on our screens. Who is this woman anyway, and who let her onstage? Wendy Williams built her career on saying things other people wouldn’t say Williams, born in New Jersey, got her start in radio in the late 1980s. She worked her way up through DC- and New York-based stations and, by 1993, had earned a Billboard Radio Award, honoring her as the R&B; Major Market Radio Air Personality of the Year. She gave her listeners candid advice and shared the details of her own life dramas. Williams was known for her fiery, unapologetic personality. According to a 2005 New York magazine profile , during her run at WBLS, her interns were instructed not to speak to her unless spoken to. She bounced around different stations into the 2000s, discussing pop and rap stars on-air. She’s also struggled publicly: with being fired and ostracized, with a cheating husband who was also her manager, with substance abuse issues and her chronic illnesses. Williams made a name for herself by getting immensely personal with her listeners, which is perhaps why her fanbase is so enamored with her. Marie Nerestant, a 43-year-old in New York City, has been a Wendy fan since high school. Now, she watches The Wendy Williams Show every single day while her kids are at school. “She speaks her truth,” Nerestant told me about why she is drawn to Williams’s commentary. “She says what everybody wants to say, but is too afraid to say.” This, she theorizes, is why so many people are put off by Williams. “She has her flaws, and she’s not afraid to say it. She has Graves’ disease. She has lymphedema. She went through a terrible divorce. She’s said everything. What else does she have to prove to anybody?” Wendy hasn’t only spoken her own truth, though — and a fair share of celebrities have taken issue with Williams over the course of her career. In the ’90s, she had a habit of “outing” various rappers and pop stars, making claims that Sean Combs, Whitney Houston , and others were gay. These accusations were not taken lightly. Houston’s friend Robyn Crawford admitted that the pair planned to confront Williams over the gossip. Williams has also implied that Combs sent a girl group from his record label to assault her and intimated that he got her fired from Hot 97. Tupac even threw a diss at her in his music, after she made claims about his time in prison. Despite the drama, Williams’s brashness attracted television execs, and in 2008 she was asked to do a trial run of her own syndicated talk show. It was a sweeping success. Immediately the show resonated, in particular with women between the ages of 18 and 54. Fox and BET jumped on the chance to broadcast the program, and the rest is history. Her appeal to many Black women and gay men was crucial to her success, even though it is arguable that they should be most offended by her. And that is the strange magic of Wendy Williams. Aside from her talk show, Williams has done standup, acted in movies , written books (fiction and nonfiction), and appeared in a Broadway production of Chicago . Just this past January, she simultaneously released a biopic and a documentary through Lifetime . In the fall of 2020, she was revealed as a performer on The Masked Singer , costumed as a big mouth, which is, well, pretty on the nose. Williams’s daytime gig, however, was more than enough job for most. Her typically tireless schedule meant that everyone with cable has likely come across her at some point or another. Stay-at-home mothers, children home sick, patients in doctors’ waiting rooms, and the like have all crossed paths with Wendy . Her celebrity gossip segment, aptly titled “Hot Topics,” dissected the latest entertainment news and might have been the purest expression of the Wendy Williams persona. She talked, and the audience listened. Williams’s fans love her, but they don’t always agree with her The intimacy of The Wendy Williams Show was its main strength; Williams lounged in her purple armchair not just before her audience, but as if they were sitting at the same table together. When she gossiped, notoriously unscripted, it felt like chatting with a friend. She called her fans her “co-hosts.” While a host like Ellen DeGeneres speaks to celebrities the way a friend would, Williams spoke to and about them as if she were not also a celebrity. She had no issue prying or having guests on the show that she had previously gossiped about . She separated herself from the celebrity tribe and put herself at the level of the viewer, ignoring the tension that might exist between her role and her own fame. The format of The Wendy Williams Show never changed much over time. Neither did its host, who remained often brutal toward celebrities. According to her fans, this is part of the appeal — but also, not always their favorite thing. “I prefer when she keeps it light,” says Tracy Turner, a 54-year-old fan who watched Wendy a few times a week. For eight years, Turner had been tuning in to see what Williams has to say, whether it’s for her recurring celebrity lookalike segment or giving advice to audience members. What Turner is less interested in is when the commentary turns a little nasty, as in Williams’s unsolicited “ advice ” on the rocky relationship of Love & Hip-Hop stars Safaree Samuels and Erica Mena. It seemed like a randomly fired shot, but in Turner’s opinion, there are some people who Williams just does not like, and it affected her coverage of them. “She used to come for the Kardashians , but then she met them , and then she changed the narrative,” Turner said. While Williams’s opinions could flip-flop — much to the annoyance of some of her fans — they also reflected a very human impulse. Her feelings are allowed to change, regardless of how forcibly she expressed them, even for, as Turner points out, sometimes indiscernible reasons. These shifts made her that much more unpredictable, which is compelling to those who have watched the nature of her fame change over time. When your audience doesn’t take you 100 percent seriously, it makes you much harder to cancel. What follows is a brief synopsis of Wendy Williams’s most-cancellable hits: There was her explosive conversation with Whitney Houston in her radio days , where she asked Houston how her drug use affected her family (Williams has detailed her own issues with cocaine ). Houston hung up on her. On the radio in 2006, Williams leaked that Method Man’s wife had cancer before some of the couple’s own family members even knew. She’s had to apologize for claiming that gay men “should leave skirts and heels to women.” When Terry Crews spoke out about being sexually assaulted, she said he was “not brave.” In 2018, she complained about the Me Too movement and defended R. Kelly, who had long been accused of and was convicted of sexual abuse in 2021. She later changed her mind , calling him “sick” and condemning his actions. She misgendered a trans athlete and made ill-informed, transphobic jokes . In July 2021, Williams implied that the marriage of actress and vegan influencer Tabitha Brown, who recently was able to help her husband financially so he could retire from the LAPD, was doomed to fail , and reminded Williams of her own situation with her ex- husband Kevin Hunter . “That was out of anger. I don’t think she meant what she said,” Nerestant said. Perhaps Williams’s comments came from a place of projection due to her own romantic pains, Nerestant suggested, but said Williams was out of pocket nonetheless. “I didn’t agree with what she said. She was reaching a little bit, but she’s hurt and she’s still hurting. It’s just a process that she has to deal with.” Over the years, Williams repeatedly mocked Britney Spears , but in a twist that was so out of left field it was comedic, she declared “death to them all!” in reference to Spears’s conservators . The clip has since been scrubbed from her YouTube channel but lives on in TikTok audios . Williams’s most recent and arguably worst offense was a takedown of 19-year-old TikTok user Matima Miller, known to fans as Swavy. Williams delivered the news of Miller’s murder by comparing her follower count to his and proclaiming that she had “no idea who this person is, and neither does one person in this building.” It was a stomach-turning, senseless blow to his family, who are not famous by any means. The list of controversies goes on and on. Despite Williams’s often crude commentary, advertisers never seemed dissuaded (Chevrolet once dropped her for complaining about historically Black colleges and universities, but that’s about it), and viewers tuned in throughout her run. She was simply a natural at being on television. She glided from segment to segment as if she was just catching up with her viewers — did you hear so-and-so did this? What do you all think about this, that, and the other that what’s-his-name was caught doing last week? Even if fans didn’t always approve of her approach, they wholly believed in her right to have a platform, regardless of who it bothered. They may be frustrated by her, but they also feel a kinship, even a kind of ownership, over her. “She just wouldn’t be who she was today without stepping on some people’s toes and hurting some people’s feelings,” Nerestant said. The internet loves Wendy Williams ... kind of Wendy Williams, the person, isn’t very online. On Instagram , she merely posts recaps of her show, blurry photos of her meals (her commenters don’t hesitate to tell her when the food looks gross), and the occasional selfie. The account itself isn’t strictly business or personal, but it mostly operates as a promotional account for the show itself. Even if Wendy Williams isn’t really on the internet, in some ways she embodies its attitudes. Conversations about celebrities are always rude and outlandish online, with or without Wendy on the air . It is so easy to dogpile on Williams — a person who has said some awful things and has the nerve not to cower afterward, even though she is in the spotlight herself. In an interview with the New York Times Magazine back in 2019 , Williams was asked why people are interested in celebrity gossip. Her response was simple: “Celebrity lives are something that people can live vicariously through,” she said. “It takes people’s minds off their own troubles. Everybody has troubles.” Williams got paid to be judgmental, which is what a lot of people spend all day doing for free. Online, we’re all talk show hosts who can fire off a hot take tweet, go on a live rant, or create a slideshow of opinions theorizing on a celebrity romance. In fact, many online comment sections, threads, and forums use Williams as a tool — between user clapbacks and questions, her image dances, stares, and grimaces in GIF form through it all. Her relevance continues because Williams’s image has arguably become bigger and more significant than her actual show — maybe even bigger than Williams herself. As one TikTok user put it , she comes off as “a caricature of a woman.” Her baritone “How you doin’?” catchphrase is instantly recognizable. There’s the unfortunate clip of her fainting on-air while dressed as the Statue of Liberty for a Halloween episode. There’s an endless arsenal of pouty, shocked-looking photos of her, and internet users gravitate toward them as reaction GIFs and pics. There are countless edits of her body, warped to make her appear bug-eyed like an alien or contorted to make her torso as thin as a rail. Her being is primed for virality because there are so few famous people who are as theatrical or as unnerving. Her television audience was a loyal bunch, but her internet audience is much less kind. They see her as sort of a joke of a figure. Her memeification both proves and reinforces her popularity, but her meme status is complicated — there is real adoration and endearment there, but it’s also mixed in with casual, unfamiliar “fanship” which sees her as less of a three- dimensional person and more of, for lack of a better term, a human emoji. On a sociological level, it’s fascinating and revealing, but it’s also somewhat dangerous when one considers the social implications of making a Black woman so separate from personhood. As Beatrice Forman wrote for Vox , the online adoption of memes and slang from Black people is “committed so casually and frequently that it feels like the default mode of shitposting.” It’s no fault of her own, but Williams’s image has often been used as an instrument in that appropriation as the internet forges a world built in the likeness of Blackness. Her prevalence on Black and gay Twitter has parlayed her into wider consciousness, as such things go. In the public imagination, she is not a person but an idea. She is camp. She is, as she once said of Lil’ Kim, “an icon, a legend, and she is the moment.” That all came to a somewhat inauspicious end. Williams had only taken a few brief hiatuses before — due to Covid-19 production stops, to deal with health issues from her Graves’ disease and lymphedema, and to mourn the death of her mother. That’s why it was so unusual when the new season of Wendy was postponed. “I hope it helps to put things in perspective,” Turner said of Williams’s health issues, prior to the show’s official cancellation. “But there is a place for what she does. She is loved by pop culture.” Still, it seemed as though nothing could stop The Wendy Williams Show until she decided to end it. Now that it’s over, it’s hard to completely hate the player. We can moralize and debate about whether her work served our society, but as with so much of television, it just served to entertain — and Wendy did the job with more flair than most would dare to muster. In the months leading up to the announcement of the show’s ending, there was much concern about what exactly was going on with Williams. Despite her illness, she was seen by the paparazzi vaping in a car in New York City in September 2021, and tabloid rumors circulated that she may have fallen out of sobriety. In 2019, after discovering that her ex-husband was having a child with his girlfriend, she checked into a sober living home to prevent herself from relapsing. Later, she was admitted to a hospita l for a psychiatric evaluation. Her brother stated that the anniversary of their mother’s death may have made the time of year particularly difficult for her. When Where Is Wendy Williams? premieres on Lifetime in February 2024, fans may gain new insight into the struggles she faced toward the end of her TV tenure. Until then, though, we can only speculate from our purple armchairs at home. Update, February 22, 2024 : This story was originally published on October 18, 2021, and has been updated with news of Lifetime’s upcoming documentary, Where Is Wendy Williams? , and Williams’s recent diagnosis.

"1","I n an 8–1 decision published last week, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos created through in vitro fertilization are persons, which gives parents the ability to sue for wrongful death if the embryos are destroyed. The decision has potential ramifications for opposition to abortion on the grounds of fetal personhood. Embryo destruction is a common result of IVF, as the procedure creates an excess of embryos at the outset to increase a woman’s chances of successful implantation and pregnancy. Spare embryos are frozen and stored in tanks by IVF clinics, and parents can choose whether to discard their children as medical waste, donate them to another woman or to scientific research, or store them for a yearly fee. About 2 percent of pregnancies in the United States result from IVF, a doctor told the Associated Press. Parents Sue Fertility Clinic for Accidental Embryo Death The Alabama Supreme Court ruling resolved two lawsuits filed by three sets of parents who had undergone IVF treatments and had frozen their spare embryos at a hospital in Mobile, Alabama. In December 2020, a patient at that hospital walked into the fertility clinic and removed the embryos from the cryogenic nursery. The frozen embryos were so cold to the touch that the patient dropped them, resulting in the death of the embryos. Their parents sued for wrongful death. The Alabama Supreme Court has “long held that unborn children are ‘children’ for the purposes of Alabama’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act,” the majority explained . The lawsuit’s central question was whether that act contained “an unwritten exception … for extrauterine children – that is, unborn children who are located outside of a biological uterus at the time they are killed.” Arguing that an unborn child is a “genetically unique human being whose life begins at fertilization and ends at death” — a definition that includes frozen embryos — the court ruled that location inside or outside the womb does not alter the legal personhood of the unborn. Thus, embryos created through IVF must be considered in the state’s protections for the “sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life” articulated in the Alabama Constitution. (RELATED: Surrogacy Is in the Bible? ) IVF Ruling Has Wide-Ranging Repercussions The court’s decision did not prohibit IVF, but the logical dominoes are already falling. When it comes to homo sapiens , the creation of an embryo with a unique genetic code always means that a new person has been created. Given the legal recognition of this basic biological reality, IVF clinics will finally have to reckon with the unborn children stored in their freezers — or close altogether. But the ruling has potential implications beyond IVF, too, as many have been quick to notice. One New York Times columnist called the decision the latest episode in the “religious crusade to downgrade the personhood of women by conferring personhood on frozen embryos.” But personhood isn’t a zero-sum game. Acknowledging another person’s humanity doesn’t degrade one’s own humanity — in fact, quite the opposite. The Alabama Supreme Court made a fairly simple judgment: human life does not become more or less worthy of protection based on accidental qualities like location, size, stage of development, or degree of dependency. If a frozen embryo is a person entitled to legal protections, then so is an unborn child in utero. The ramifications for abortion are evident; whether or not the pro-life movement can coalesce around the issue is a different story. Republicans Divided on IVF In December, Kellyanne Conway released polling that showed high support for IVF, with 78 percent of self-described “pro-life advocates” and 83 percent of evangelical Christians supporting the practice. Protestant Christians take varying stances on the practice, while the Catholic Church firmly opposes IVF because it eliminates sex as the means of achieving pregnancy and results in the death of over 90 percent of the embryos created. (READ MORE: Kellyanne Conway’s Contraception Gambit ) For fifty years, the pro-life coalition united various groups with otherwise differing views around a central goal: ending abortion. But now that Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization has replaced Roe v. Wade and returned the abortion issue to the states, cracks are beginning to show. The goal of ending abortion remains evergreen, but the pro-life movement is split on questions of both strategy and principle. It’s hard enough to navigate disagreements about a national ban versus state-level bans. As pro-life politicians vie for votes from citizens who see little problem with abortion, differing opinions on issues like contraception and IVF will increasingly come to the surface. After all, the poll in which Conway gauged support for IVF among pro-life respondents was commissioned to frame contraception as a “winning issue” among women otherwise skeptical of the GOP’s position on abortion. But perhaps this ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court will give pro-lifers pause. Acknowledging the personhood of unborn children seems far more likely in cases of IVF, when those children are wanted by parents with a hefty financial investment, than it does in cases of abortion. And no matter how popular a procedure may be, a child’s right to life isn’t only relevant when it’s threatened by an abortionist. If ending IVF is a step toward abolishing abortion, some people in the pro-life movement will need to reckon with what actually happens at the fertility clinic and what we owe to the children who are created only to be frozen and thrown away.

"1","Leftists have spent much of the past week up in arms about a ruling last Friday from the Alabama Supreme Court. At first blush, it is curious that a state supreme court case would engender so much vitriol and bellyaching. But the groaning from the left-wing media and political class can be easily explained: The Alabama case entails a dispute over the destruction of unborn human life, and there is no greater sacrament for the contemporary secular leftist than the destruction of unborn human life. The secular Left’s weeklong meltdown notwithstanding, Americans should be grateful for the Alabama Supreme Court’s clarion affirmation of the Anglo-American legal tradition, as well as the inherent dignity and moral worth of unborn life. The case, LePage v. Center for Reproductive Medicine, P.C. , involved a negligent fertility clinic that failed to secure its cryogenic nursery. A hospital patient wandered into the clinic and accidentally killed several embryos. The legal question before the court was whether the parents of the dead embryonic children could file suit against the clinic under Alabama’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. As Justice Jay Mitchell explained in his straightforward majority opinion, the Alabama Supreme Court had held in an uninterrupted line of cases that an unborn child constitutes a “minor child” under the state’s wrongful death statute — regardless of stage of embryonic or fetal development. Crucially, neither the plaintiffs nor defendants contested this understanding, and the question was not before the court. The only legal question in LePage was thus whether the court should legislate from the bench and decree that which the Alabama Legislature had opted not to do itself: Read into the law an “extrauterine exception” that would retain the wrongful death statute’s inclusion of unborn children developing in utero but remove legal protection for embryos developing outside the womb. The court, appropriately, declined to do so. That’s it. That’s the whole case. A sterling concurring opinion from Chief Justice Tom Parker has attracted the most leftist outrage. Parker explored the meaning of a 2018 amendment to the Alabama Constitution, which stipulates: “This state acknowledges, declares, and affirms that it is the public policy of this state to recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life.” Parker correctly explained how the word “sanctity” cannot be understood in anything other than a religious context — namely, the Judeo-Christian tradition that is America’s great heritage. The “sanctity” of human life, he noted, is a concept that goes all the way back to the creation of man “in the image of God,” as recorded in the Book of Genesis. Parker cited other verses from Scripture, including the famous verse from the Book of Jeremiah: “When I had not yet formed you in the womb, I knew you.” He also cited other authoritative religious figures, such as John Calvin and Thomas Aquinas. Because of the case’s holding and Parker’s colorful concurrence, many on the Left have denounced LePage as an imperious act of “theocracy” or “Christian nationalism.” Nothing could be further from the truth. America was quite literally founded on the notion that “all men are created equal” and that “they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.” Thomas Jefferson, the man who penned those words but redacted his Bible to remove those parts he did not himself believe, was about the furthest thing imaginable from an Orthodox Christian. Yet even Jefferson held that our rights flow from our Creator — the very God, we know from Genesis, who made man in His image. The political theory of the American Founding is that man is made in God’s image and that we accordingly possess certain rights that no other man or ruler can deny. This is not “theocracy.” It is basic American history — basic historical literacy. No one was clearer about the role of God in the American public square than George Washington, the greatest of all the Founders, whose birthday we celebrated this week. Washington’s 1789 Thanksgiving Proclamation began by explaining that “it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor.” Washington then declared that a Thursday in late November should be “devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.” The Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling in LePage was a straightforward case of statutory interpretation. But it also affirmed and upheld this broader, venerable tradition. The reality is those decrying the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling in LePage don’t merely hate unborn human life. They hate America itself. To find out more about Josh Hammer and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at www.creators.com .

"1","P resident Joe Biden characterizes his opponents on Capitol Hill as worse than the segregationists. “I’ve been a senator since ’72,” the president told rich San Franciscans giving him money this week. “I’ve served with real racists. I’ve served with Strom Thurmond. I’ve served with all these guys that have set terrible records on race. But guess what? These guys are worse. These guys do not believe in basic democratic principles.” Biden, of course, eulogized Thurmond, per the late senator’s request, at his 2003 funeral. He characterized his relationship with Thurmond as one of “good friends,” said Fritz Hollings — a Southern Democrat, albeit one not easily pigeonholed as a segregationist — was his closest friend in the U.S. Senate, and described segregationist John Stennis as someone who became his friend. In 2020, he apologized, in the midst of attacks on him by fellow Democrats for his opposition to bussing almost a half-century earlier, for delivering the eulogy. The de rigueur practice of condemning the dead for offenses against the ever-changing yet deeply held convictions of the living did not overwhelm the United States or even the Democrat Party in 2003. Biden’s measured remembrance of Thurmond, who was, as Biden hinted, too “complex” and lived too long a life to reduce to a one-word obituary (“racist!”), should not have required an apology. But the graceless world Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats created — one of statutory murder and names sandblasted off buildings and $50,000 spent to remove a 42-ton boulder from a campus because people long ago gave it a racist nickname — necessitated such a mea maxima culpa, so one cannot feel excessive sympathy for one so obviously hoisted on his own petard. One could interpret the cannonade Biden fired at Republicans in one of two ways. Either it says his political opponents occupy a particularly cretinous wrung on the morality ladder or that he never really found segregationists all that repugnant. The president clearly intended to say the former. His actions as a politician scream the latter. When Joe Biden first won elective office, former Klansman and fellow Democrat Hugo Black still sat on the U.S. Supreme Court. During Biden’s tenure in the U.S. Senate, he repeatedly voted for Robert Byrd, a former Ku Klux Klan Exalted Cyclops, to lead Democrats in that body. He served alongside segregationists James Eastland, John Sparkman, and Herman Talmadge without any contemporaneous complaint. Biden befriended rather than anathematized segregationists in real time. It was a more collegial body back then, after all, so one questions whether to condemn the civility then or the rancor now. All these years later, he carts out the racist Democrats — 99 percent of segregationists belonged to Biden’s party — he chummed around with in the U.S. Senate to tar the opposing party. The racists have their uses as boogeymen for Biden — in sliming Robert Bork during the 1980s or Donald Trump supporters today — decades after the fact. In other words, when they wandered the halls of the Capitol — on their last political breaths — as 30-year-old Joe Biden entered the Senate, Southern racists did not repel him. He joined their party, after all, and forged friendships and alliances with them. All these years later, when they roam Congress merely as ghosts rather than flesh and blood, Biden uses what then did not scare him to now scare voters away from his political adversaries."
"1","T here’s an old meme that you’ve surely seen. To paraphrase, it holds that conspiracy nuts are really just six months ahead of everybody else. Then there’s the other meme that asks if you’ve apologized to your conspiracy theorist friends for doubting them. These days, we’re beginning to shed our assumptions that the comfortable, boring normal we grew up with, in which most cops and politicians were honest and we could trust our institutions to act in beneficent ways, would continue. Americans know that those assumptions don’t hold anymore, and we’re beginning to come to terms with the fact that we’re in decline as a country, and active measures — and real reforms — have to be engaged if we don’t want to see the end of our republic as we know it. But that realization doesn’t necessarily mean all of the conspiracy theories out there are true. Here’s the thing: the line about how the conspiracy nuts are six months ahead of everybody else has a little validity to it. The thing about your conspiracy nut friends is that most of them are pretty intelligent people, and intelligent people tend to be pretty good at picking up patterns and connecting dots from them. Of course, without all the information, and there is so much information out there both available and hidden that it’s really tough to get a full picture of the kinds of subjects about which so- called conspiracy theories are advanced, you’re bound to be wrong often when you see those patterns. And that’s why people who attempt to see past the facade the people who run our institutions usually put up, especially when there are shenanigans or utter incompetence afoot, often come out looking like nuts. Who knows? Maybe the five items below aren’t part of a sinister pattern our evil elites are constructing with our demise in mind. Or maybe they are. What we can say is that these are interesting times. And when the Chinese coined that “may you live in interesting times” line, they meant it as a curse. This week felt a little like that curse was paying out. 1\. It Really Is State-Run Media, Isn’t It? For a long time, conservatives and others have been screaming that the “mainstream” media was nothing more than a collection of propaganda outlets pushing out narratives for the entrenched power elite, and the response to that is, well, all together now… “That’s a conspiracy theory!” OK, fine, but what about this? : “Anyone who isn’t confused really doesn’t understand the situation.” Those words, from CBS icon Edward R. Murrow, came to mind this week after I spoke with journalists at the network. There is trouble brewing at Black Rock, the headquarters of CBS, after the firing of Catherine Herridge, an acclaimed investigative reporter. Many of us were shocked after Herridge was included in layoffs this month, but those concerns have increased after CBS officials took the unusual step of seizing her files, computers and records, including information on privileged sources. The position of CBS has alarmed many, including the union, as an attack on free press principles by one of the nation’s most esteemed press organizations. I have spoken confidentially with current and former CBS employees who have stated that they could not recall the company ever taking such a step before. One former CBS journalist said that many employees “are confused why [Herridge] was laid off, as one of the correspondents who broke news regularly and did a lot of original reporting.” That has led to concerns about the source of the pressure. He added that he had never seen a seizure of records from a departing journalist, and that the move had sent a “chilling signal” in the ranks of CBS. That’s from Jonathan Turley, writing at the Hill . Is Turley a conspiracy theorist? That’s not his reputation. You’ll remember that Catherine Herridge not two months ago was talking about the strong possibility of a “black swan” national security event happening this year… Then she gets fired, and CBS — which is as Deep State Media as you can get, so much so that Herridge, a former Fox News investigative reporter, never really fit in there — seizes all of her work product. I hope she made copies. 2\. Yes, They Do Want to Take Away Your Car and Force You Onto Their Awful Subways The electric vehicle mandates and the never-ending fuel efficiency demands by Democrats at the federal and, where they can get away with it, the state level have always been fodder for many to allege that taking away Americans’ freedom of movement rather than saving the planet was the aim. Yes, but… “That’s a conspiracy theory!” Is it? These draconian and silly moves — coming for your water heater and gas stove, stopping you from eating meat, taking away your plastic straws and plenty else — carry virtually no persuasive justification. We all know that. But yet the narrative continues. Then you have something like the city of Chicago now filing a “climate change” lawsuit against BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips this week. They’re not the first to do it, but it’s starting to look like the legal system is just corrupt enough that one of these suits will stick, at least at the district court level. What I wrote about this earlier in the week was that those oil companies ought to embargo the city of Chicago for two weeks. Just close the 200-something gas stations they operate in the Windy City, and watch Chicago descend into chaos. Then ask the idiot mayor, Brandon Johnson, if he’s ready to drop his stupid lawsuit. There aren’t enough consequences for these evil ignoramuses. But of course, Brandon Johnson isn’t really in charge of Chicago. The people who are? They’re not stupid like he is. But they’re very, very evil — and attempting to bankrupt Big Oil in order to “save the planet” simply means only the rich elites get to drive around in their cars. You? You get to ride the subway. Or a bicycle, like they do in all those chaotic Third World cities. 3\. Can We Talk About Just How Awful AI Can Be Now? “It’s just a conspiracy theory!” goes the complaint about those who point out the risks that artificial intelligence poses to our understanding of how knowledge and truth might survive in an AI age. This is a topic that will only get hotter and hotter. I actually use a lot of AI for image generation because what I’ve found out in my years of being in independent media is that photojournalism is a field populated by a whole lot of snarling leftists who are attached to the most unscrupulous lawyers you’ve ever seen, and the only way to ensure these people won’t attempt to rake you over the coals even if you adhere to the most rigid and widely accepted principles of fair use is AI. But the AI image generators operate on the garbage-in, garbage-out principle. And it isn’t just that if you give the generator a bad prompt it’ll give you a bad image. Many of them suffer from atrocious programming by the radical snowflakes who built them. Take Google’s new Gemini AI image generator, which is revealed to be stupid to such an extent that it’s actually dangerous: Here it is apologizing for deviating from my prompt, and offering to create images that ""strictly adhere to the traditional definition of ""Founding Fathers,"" in line with my wishes. So I give the prompt to do that. But it doesn't seem to work pic.twitter.com/6dfb4Exqsg — Michael Tracey (@mtracey) February 21, 2024 I asked Google Gemini to generate images of the Founding Fathers. It seems to think George Washington was black. pic.twitter.com/CsSrNlpXKF — Patrick Ganley (@Patworx) February 21, 2024 Google Gemini can’t generate a “Norman Rockwell style image of American life in the 1940s” because Rockwell “idealized” American life pic.twitter.com/lpUV39tSUb — Echo Chamber (@echo_chamberz) February 21, 2024 Gemini is terrible. Adobe Firefly, which is actually pretty good at generating images depending on what you ask it to do, is similarly infused with stupid wokeness. Well, at least in two out of the four images, Adobe managed not to deliver Zulus instead of Vikings. Here’s another one. This one is a hoot… Here’s the problem with all of this: when woke propaganda is plugged into the core code of these AI apps, not just with imagery but more importantly with text, and then when people start using AI to do research or get their news, we will lose the truth. And that isn’t a conspiracy theory. It’s reality, and it’s in your face. 4\. Yes, Jan. 6 Was a Fedsurrection Oh, how they scoff at you when you bring this one up. But if the federal government had nothing to do with turning a protest into a riot on Jan. 6 that the power elite could monetize to drain the America First movement of its momentum and throw cold water on the outrage about the 2020 presidential election, then how do you explain the bizarre pipe bombs story? Luke Rosiak at the Daily Wire had a fascinating piece containing an interview with Kenneth Capolino, a former Capitol Police officer who is now the RNC’s director of security. He discussed the pipe bombs found at the DNC’s headquarters and the Capitol Hill Club, a big hangout for Republican politicos across the street from the RNC’s headquarters. The whole thing is well worth a read; it recounts bizarre fact after bizarre fact about those bombs as well as the utter disinterest in finding or punishing the culprits. Go ahead and read it. Then you can come back and explain any of the pipe bomb story without conceding that the federal role in the chaos of that day wasn’t quite active. Finally… 5\. Nikki Haley Might Not Be the Manchurian Candidate, but She’s at Least Tibetan or Something Most people concede this isn’t a conspiracy theory, but you can still find some of the Haley boosters who’ll deny that she’s a stooge for the Democrats and the ruling elite in an effort to throw sand in the gears of Donald Trump’s campaign. The fact that most of her votes in the first two primary contests of this cycle came from Democrats crossing over party lines to vote for her was a dead giveaway. Some of the stupid things she’s said on the campaign trail haven’t helped her cause much, either. But this? I don’t know how you can refuse to concede the question after this: Nimarata ‘Nikki’ Haley’s failing presidential campaign is being bankrolled by over 5,200 former donors to Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign, lending credence to Donald Trump’s contention that she is only remaining in the race to try and damage him ahead of the general election. The Biden donors underwriting Haley include 1,600 people who donated over $500,000 in January alone — her biggest month for donations ever, despite the fact she was crushed by Trump in Iowa , where she placed third, and New Hampshire . That National Pulse piece noted that Haley’s top backer has been Jeffrey Epstein Pedo Island A-lister Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn fame; Hoffman’s other anti-Trump exploit was his bankrolling of the E. Jean Carroll fake rape/defamation litigation against Trump. Nobody who’s a conservative would have anything to do with Hoffman, and yet Haley took his money eagerly. He’s not giving her any more, not because she’s rejected him but because he realizes he’s setting that money on fire by funding her campaign. But hey — most political candidates these days are frauds and shills for the power elite. What’s one more at the end of the day? We should at least be able to identify them when it’s this obvious."
"1","Alabama’s Supreme Court ruled last week that, under state law, embryos produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF) are children. This is a correct decision, as embryos are in fact children. Embryos have the unique DNA of an individual person and, given the right conditions, will grow into adults. The fact that an embryo is not within his or her mother does not negate his or her personhood. Following the ruling, several providers of IVF in Alabama, including the University of Alabama at Birmingham, announced that they will be ceasing those services, as they are unable to provide them without accidentally and purposefully killing embryos. In the opinion, Associate Justice Jay Mitchell explained that Alabama’s Supreme Court has long held that unborn children are recognized as children for purposes of the state’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, which was at issue in the case. For example, when a child is killed in utero by the “wrongful act, omission, or negligence of any person,” the Wrongful Death of a Minor Act is applicable. Mitchell explained that the only unique factor here is the location of the unborn child, and that this is not differentiated in the law at issue. Several conservative leaders have responded to the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision by denouncing it. Georgia Gov. Brain Kemp, for instance, came out to defend IVF as a great good that must be preserved. “You have a lot of people out there in this country that they wouldn’t have children if it weren’t for [IVF],” he said. And Nikki Haley, though she first came out to affirm the humanity of embryos — saying : “Embryos, to me, are babies. When you talk about an embryo … to me, that’s a life” — later seemed to backtrack and offer support for IVF. “Be very careful how you do this because number one, you don’t want to take those fertility treatments away from women,” Haley said . “It is very important that women like me have the ability to have that blessing of a baby.” Conservatives need to wake up to reality: In vitro fertilization is an ugly, evil practice that not only kills millions of children but also has led to a society in which we commodify children as assets to be bought and sold and women as bodies that can be purchased. This is an industry that ought to be destroyed. Conservatives should pursue the end of IVF just as adamantly as abortion because IVF entails killing or freezing a number of children to create just one. This is in part because each in vitro treatment typically produces 12–15 children of a particular set of parents. Parents who decide to purchase a baby through IVF must perform a whole host of evil acts. The most evil of those acts is that parents must sacrifice the lives of some of their children in order to attain the child they want. Indeed, most every child born by IVF in the United States has siblings who were either killed or frozen so that they could be born. E. Christian Brugger of the National Catholic Register estimated that “more than two and a half million human beings” were killed or frozen in America in 2021 alone to fuel this baby-selling industry. Moreover, parents who use a “surrogate” to bear their child treat a woman’s life-giving capacity as something they can buy. And when a child is produced by “donor” eggs or sperm, he or she is created with the explicit plan of denying him or her a biological mother and/or father. The value of the global IVF industry is expected to reach $51.73 billion by 2032. Thus, there has been a major effort on the part of these companies to conceal the twisted nature of their baby-selling and baby-killing enterprise. Evidently, that effort has been extraordinary successful. It has ensnared a majority of American conservatives, as, according to Kellyanne Conway, 86 percent of Americans support in vitro fertilization. Nikki Haley’s response to the Alabama Supreme Court decision suggests that some support for IVF is due to ignorance of its evil. Haley correctly maintains that embryos are human persons and rightly denounces the evil of murder. Yet she somehow misses the fact that there is no IVF without murder. We can get a better glimpse at the inherent evil of the IVF process through some of the injustices committed to the children born through it. For example, Khloé Kardashian created a child via IVF and surrogacy with her serial cheater boyfriend, who promptly cheated again before the birth of the child, causing them to break up; Anderson Cooper paid for the creation of two children with his ex-boyfriend , who was his ex-boyfriend at the time the children were produced, thus depriving the children of their biological mother; and Amber Heard used IVF and surrogacy to create a child “ on her own ,” thus depriving her daughter of her father. Of course, the worst part of all this is the fact that millions of children are sacrificed on the altar of the IVF industry, but these examples of deprivation and loss should ignite concern among even those who support the killing of unborn children. Other states have laws similar to Alabama’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. They, too, should recognize that embryos produced through IVF apply under those laws. It is the fastest way to slow the mass slaughter of innocents."
"1","Why is Joe Biden prosecuting Texas instead of sanctuary cities? On one hand, Texas has the audacity to defend itself, and America’s border in the process. On the other hand, sanctuary cities are undercutting federal immigration law enforcement efforts. It shouldn’t be a hard choice — unless you’re Joe Biden. The Biden administration’s illogical response to the illegal immigration assault on America tells us all we need to know about what the president’s priorities are. America has had an illegal immigration crisis since Biden became president. According to a recent estimate , 7.2 million illegal immigrants have entered the U.S. during Biden’s presidency. That’s larger than the populations of 36 states and all American cities except New York. If you thought that news couldn’t be worse, you’re wrong: The numbers have been going up. December’s 250,000 arrests for illegal crossings marked a new record — that’s up 31 percent from November and 13 percent from the previous December’s 222,000, which had been the old record . This historic surge happened not by accident but by actions — Biden’s. In its first 100 days , Biden stopped border wall construction, ended the “Remain in Mexico” protocols, terminated cooperative asylum agreements, and terminated the prompt review of asylum claims. And that was just the beginning. His actions have also hamstrung America’s internal enforcement tools of DHS and ICE. In short, his every step has been a misstep for America’s border security. In the face of onslaught, Texas took action. In response, the Biden administration took Texas to court — on several occasions — over Texas’ border barriers . The state’s latest actions include an upcoming law (to take effect on March 5) that will allow Texas to arrest and deport those who cross the border illegally and to build a base camp near the border for its National Guard troops. Biden’s Department of Justice is suing to block the March 5 law. In contrast to Biden’s aggressive actions against Texas, sanctuary cities continue unchallenged by the administration. Sanctuary cities are not new. They are generally considered to have started — not surprisingly in San Francisco — in 1989 . There is no definitive count, but one estimate in late 2022 identified that 180 cities and counties and more than 10 states had adopted sanctuary laws. There is no single definition of a sanctuary city, but the Center for Immigration Studies describes them in general: These cities, counties, and states have laws, ordinances, regulations, resolutions, policies, or other practices that obstruct immigration enforcement and shield criminals from ICE — either by refusing to or prohibiting agencies from complying with ICE detainers, imposing unreasonable conditions on detainer acceptance, denying ICE access to interview incarcerated aliens, or otherwise impeding communication or information exchanges between their personnel and federal immigration officers. When Biden has sued Texas, his claim has been that Texas’ actions on the border interfere with its authority to enforce immigration laws . So, how come Biden isn’t suing sanctuary cities? Sanctuary cities’ obstruction of immigration enforcement is a far bigger infringement on the federal government’s authority. Plus, these ordinances run counter to what the federal government is supposed to be doing: protecting the border and American citizens. Sanctuary cities unquestionably are an incentive to illegal immigration. In fact, civil rights groups suing Texas over its March 5 law are doing so on the basis that this incentive is being thwarted, saying that “the law blocks migrants from seeking asylum and other humanitarian relief.” Assuredly, Biden is at fault for the border crisis, but even with the administration’s reduction of illegal immigration’s risk, the return on it must also be in place. Sanctuary cities increase that return. It is not as though the cost of this incentive is unknown. There is a budget cost, of course. There is also the cost arising from criminals, drugs, and terrorists crossing the border. All of Texas’ actions reduce those costs. All of the sanctuary cities’ actions increase them, at least indirectly. Biden should be thanking, not suing, Texas for doing his job for him. Of course, everyone in America — and apparently a large portion of people south of our southern border — know the reason why Biden is not only not enforcing our borders but also opening them and thwarting those who would close them: Doing so would upset the extreme Left on which he and his administration increasingly depend for support. So, Biden is taking Texas — not sanctuary cities, which are impeding federal border enforcement authority to a far greater extent and have been for a far longer period of time and on a far greater scale — to court. Biden’s actions have been unquestionably unconscionable from first to last when it comes to illegal immigration. They are also revealing. They tell America what Biden sees his job to be: getting reelected by serving his extreme Left, not the country. J.T. Young was a professional staffer in the House and Senate from 1987–2000, served in the Department of Treasury and Office of Management and Budget from 2001–2004, and was director of government relations for a Fortune 20 company from 2004–2023."
"1","T o borrow from President Ronald Reagan: “There they go again.” The “they” in this instance would be the Never Trumpers continuing their masquerade as conservatives. Newsmax headlines: Fourth ‘Anti-CPAC’ Summit Packed With Trump Critics Newsmax reports: While the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) gets underway next week outside of Washington, D.C., a rival “anti-CPAC” will take place inside the beltway at the same time. The fourth annual Principles First Summit bills itself as an alternative to CPAC and it features a speaker’s list marking a who’s-who of anti-Donald Trump Republicans — former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, former RNC chair Michael Steele, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Trump critic George Conway and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, to name a few. Principles First defines itself as “principled Americans on the right and center-right who were concerned about the health of American democracy organized a series of meet-ups around the country to serve as an alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference.” In reality, there is nothing — zero — about this group that is “conservative.” CPAC, on the other hand — long a decided favorite of President Reagan — lists the following decidedly conservatives as speakers: Dr. Ben Carson, Vivek Ramaswamy, Rep. Jim Jordan, U.K. Brexit leader Nigel Farage, Sen. J.D. Vance, Argentine President Javier Milei, journalist John Solomon, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, My Pillow’s Mike Lindell, Newsmax’s Ed Henry, former Ambassador Richard Grenell, China expert Gordon Chang, Monica Crowley, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Fox and talk radio’s Mark Levin, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Kari Lake, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Rep. Scott Perry, Breitbart’s Matt Boyle, and so many more. Including, yes indeed, former President Donald Trump. And there are more on the list. This is as opposed to that cabal of anti-conservatives trying desperately to portray themselves as something they are not. Note well that the anti-CPAC group includes ex- Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger. Kinzinger, of course — along with then-Rep. Liz Cheney — served on the seriously anti-democracy January 6th Committee that went out of its way to conduct hearings that denied due process to witnesses that held a different view on the events of J6 than the stacked deck of Pelosi-handpicked Committee members. Suffice to say, democracy worked its magic and neither are any longer in Congress per the voters of their states. As that list of CPAC speakers illustrates, those are the real seriously principled conservatives, thoughtful and accomplished Americans one and all. They have records of accomplishment and one and all are fearless in standing up for democracy. Indeed it speaks volumes that these Never Trump-anti-CPAC partisans are attacking an organization that President Reagan played such a real role in creating — and which has remained utterly faithful to his vision for CPAC. Which is to say a vision of being decidedly conservative. I write this from, yes indeed, CPAC. There are thousands here. They are listening to speakers, taking in the long list of exhibits and making new friends from across the country when not seeing old friends. Decades ago I attended the very first CPAC in the mid-1970s, which gathered at the old Shoreham Hotel in Washington. The event drew about 200 people in the hotel ballroom, and we listened to our featured speaker — then former California Governor Ronald Reagan. Time has moved on and CPAC has blossomed, with thousands here these few days. And yes, former President Trump, like then-President Reagan before him, will close out the proceedings. Not to be ignored either is the vigorous leadership of the current CPAC leaders, former Bush 43 White House Political Director Matt Schlapp and his wife, ex-Trump White House Communications Director Mercedes Schlapp. Suffice to say the goal for CPAC so long ago envisioned by President Reagan has been reached — and CPAC will go on and go on growing no matter who the conservative president of the moment may be. And it’s “First Principles” critics — who clearly have none — will over time vanish into the political mists. Somewhere President Reagan is chuckling."

"2","One week ago, Alabama’s Supreme Court issued a now (in)famous 131-page decision that invoked God to claim that frozen embryos count as “children” under state law. The unprecedented legal opinion, which came out of a tragic negligence case in which families sued someone who had accidentally destroyed their frozen embryos, has sent shockwaves across the country. Policymakers, parents, and prospective parents are realizing it could seriously imperil in- vitro fertilization (IVF) or dramatically hike its already prohibitive costs. About 2 percent of births in the US are done through IVF, which entails fertilizing eggs outside of the body and then transferring embryos to a womb. We’re already seeing consequences. Two days ago, the University of Alabama at Birmingham health system — the largest hospital in the state — announced it was pausing IVF , given the new risks of criminal prosecution and litigation. Since then, at least two more Alabama fertility clinics have followed suit. Let’s be clear. This decision and its very obvious fallout are a victory for an extremist wing of the anti-abortion movement I’ve been covering for the last two years. These particular activists believe in the radical idea of “fetal personhood,” meaning they want to endow fetuses (and embryos) with full human rights and legal protection. It’s also a reminder that the overturn of Roe v. Wade is about more than just abortion. It has ramifications for the full spectrum of reproductive health care — including birth control and fertility treatments. Roughly one in eight couples nationwide struggles with infertility. A 2023 Pew survey found that 42 percent of US adults say they or someone they know has used treatments like IVF or artificial insemination. “There was a time post- Dobbs where wealthier people thought they were not going to be affected ... there was a sense that IVF was in a gated country club,” Stephen Stetson, the director of Planned Parenthood Alabama, told me. “But the people in this movement have been very clear about their intentions. There is a war on bodily autonomy.” What this means for women This week, I spoke with Tasha Coryell as she was celebrating the second birthday of her son, whom she gave birth to thanks to successful IVF treatment in Alabama. “I had a really good experience seeking fertility treatment in Alabama, it was one of the few medical experiences I’ve had where I felt really listened to,” she told me. Being pregnant in Alabama, though, was scary for Tasha. “We knew there was a potential problem with our baby, and though it turned out to be something very, very minor, there was a chance I would have to have an abortion and we weren’t at all sure I would be able to get one,” she explained. “That was the most anxiety-inducing time I’ve ever experienced in my entire life.” vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Subscribe Tasha and her family decided not to risk the possibility of an unsafe pregnancy in Alabama again, so after years of living in the state, they relocated last summer to Minnesota. But her 11 remaining embryos are still stored in an Alabama cryogenic facility, and she’s been considering trying for another child. Earlier this month, before the Alabama state Supreme Court decision came down, Tasha called her fertility doctor to ask for general advice. Her doctor recommended keeping the embryos in Alabama, since they could be damaged in transport and relocation would not be cheap. But now Tasha is left to make sense of this decision. Should she move her embryos out now? “I have no idea what’s going to happen legally,” she said. “Can Alabama force people to continue paying for embryo storage year after year after year? Do they have to exist forever?” She knows she’s luckier than most, since she at least already has one child. “I keep thinking about people in the middle of all this who are currently injecting themselves with shots,” she said. Even under “good” circumstances, IVFs is grueling, and it can be difficult for people to talk about. Now, for some women, it might all be for naught. Is IVF totally over in Alabama — or, next, the whole country? The ruling was somewhat narrow and did not weigh in on the future of other frozen embryos. As my colleague Ian Millhiser explained , there’s a world where this decision could be relatively contained. The case is also not over; the state Supreme Court is sending it back to a district court for further litigation. In short, this victory for the fetal-personhood movement isn’t fully set, but medical providers and patients like Tasha are already left trying to piece together answers that nobody yet has. “It’s a climate of chaos and confusion,” Stetson, of Planned Parenthood Alabama, told me. “I can appreciate the desire of lawyers who are advising fertility clinics to be conservative. No one wants to be on the hook for any legal liability or risk of criminal prosecution if some district attorney gets the wrong idea.” One possibility is that IVF will continue in Alabama, but embryos will be stored in other states — raising the costs and complexity of the procedure. For the rest of the country, IVF specialists are now on high alert and warn that this first-of-its-kind decision may be just the start in courts and state legislatures. This is all a sober reminder that for many activists, attacking reproductive health care has always been about more than just ending abortion. For these religious crusaders, nothing short of “fetal personhood” will suffice. This story appeared originally in Today, Explained , Vox’s flagship daily newsletter.

"2","Remember when AI art generators became widely available in 2022 and suddenly the internet was full of uncanny pictures that were very cool but didn’t look quite right on close inspection? Get ready for that to happen again — but this time for video. Last week, OpenAI released Sora, a generative AI model that produces videos based on a simple prompt. It’s not available to the public yet, but CEO Sam Altman showed off its capabilities by taking requests on X, formerly known as Twitter . Users replied with short prompts: “ a monkey playing chess in a park ,” or “ a bicycle race on ocean with different animals as athletes .” It’s uncanny, mesmerizing, weird, beautiful — and prompting the usual cycle of commentary. Some people are making strong claims about Sora’s negative effects , expecting a “ wave of disinformation ” — but while I (and experts) think future powerful AI systems pose really serious risks , claims that a specific model will bring the disinformation wave upon us have not held up so far. Others are pointing at Sora’s many flaws as representing fundamental limitations of the technology — which was a mistake when people did it with image generator models and which, I suspect, will be a mistake again. As my colleague A.W. Ohlheiser pointed out , “just as DALL-E and ChatGPT improved over time, so could Sora.” The predictions, both bullish and bearish, may yet pan out — but the conversation around Sora and generative AI would be more productive if people on all sides took into greater account all the ways in which we’ve been proven wrong these last couple of years. What DALL-E 2 and Midjourney can teach us about Sora Two years ago, OpenAI announced DALL-E 2 , a model that could produce still images from a text prompt. The high-resolution fantastical images it produced were quickly all over social media, as were the takes on what to think of it: Real art? Fake art? A threat to artists? A tool for artists? A disinformation machine? Two years later, it’s worth a bit of a retrospective if we want our takes on Sora to age better. DALL-E 2’s release was only a few months ahead of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion , two popular competitors. They each had their strengths and weaknesses. DALL-E 2 did more photorealistic pictures and adhered a little better to prompts; Midjourney was “artsier.” Collectively, they made AI art available at the click of a button to millions. Much of the societal impact of generative AI then didn’t come directly from DALL-E 2, but from the wave of image models it led. Likewise, we might expect that the important question about Sora isn’t just what Sora can do, but what its imitators and competitors will be able to do. Many people thought that DALL-E and its competitors heralded a flood of deepfake propaganda and scams that’d threaten our democracy. While we may well see an effect like that some day, those calls now seem to have been premature. The effect of deepfakes on our democracy “always seems just around the corner,” analyst Peter Carlyon wrote in December , noting that most propaganda continues to be of a more boring kind — for example, taking remarks out of context, or images of one conflict shared and mislabeled as being from another. Presumably at some point this will change, but there should be some humility about claims that Sora will be that change. It doesn’t take deepfakes to lie to people, and they remain an expensive way to do it. (AI generations are relatively cheap, but if you’re going for something specific and convincing, that’s much pricier. A tsunami of deepfakes implies a scale that spammers mostly can’t afford at the moment.) But the place where it seems most crucial to me to remember the last two years of AI history is when I read criticisms of Sora’s images for being clumsy, stilted, inhuman, or obviously flawed. It’s true, they are. Sora “does not accurately model the physics of many basic interactions,” OpenAI’s research release acknowledges, adding that it has trouble with cause and effect, mixing up left and right, and following a trajectory. Related How fake AI images can expand your mind Nearly identical criticisms were, of course, made of DALL-E 2 and Midjourney — at least at first. Early coverage of DALL-E 2 highlighted its incompetencies, from creating horrifying monstrosities whenever you asked for multiple characters in a scene to giving people claws instead of hands . AI experts argued that the inability of AI to handle “compositionality” — or instructions about how to compose the elements of a scene — reflected a shortcoming fundamental to the technology . In practice, though, models got better at fulfilling highly specific prompts and users got better at prompting, and as a result it’s possible today to create images with complex and detailed scenes. Nearly all of the entertaining deficiencies were corrected in DALL-E 3, released last year, and in the latest updates to Midjourney. Today’s image generators can do hands and crowd scenes fine. In the time between DALL-E 2 and Sora, AI image generation has gone from a party trick to a massive industry. Many of the things DALL-E 2 couldn’t do, DALL-E 3 could. And if DALL-E 3 couldn’t, a competitor often could. That’s a perspective that’s crucial to keep in mind when you read prognosticating on Sora — you’re likely looking at early steps into a major new capability, one that could be used for good or malicious purposes, and while it’s possible to oversell it, it’s also very easy to sell it short. Instead of overcommitting to any particular perspective on what Sora and its successors will or won’t be able to do, it’s worth admitting some uncertainty about where this is headed. It’s much easier to say, “This technology will keep improving by leaps and bounds” than to guess the specifics of how that will play out.

"2","Users of Zyn , a brand of nicotine pouch that’s become a touchstone among right-wing commentators, extol its ability to free the mind, increase productivity, and even enhance sexual performance . “I use it every second I’m awake,” said Tucker Carlson on an episode of the Full Send comedy podcast in 2023. “Seconds before I fall asleep, I take it out.” There’s no evidence to promote Zyn as a sexual aid; nicotine actually constricts blood vessels , which can increase the risk of erectile dysfunction. The addictive substance can also raise blood sugar and blood pressure and may harden the walls of arteries , raising the chance of a heart attack. Nonetheless, Zyn has become part of a particularly politicized 2024 vision of masculinity: It’s about efficiency, rising and grinding, “taking on the world.” That hyped-up ethos of Zyn — call it mascuzynity, in honor of Zyn aficionados’ affection for adding “Zyn” to other words — is part of a larger narrative that’s being sold to young American men by tech entrepreneurs like Elon Musk , misogynist influencers like Andrew Tate , hustle gurus on TikTok , and, to some degree, Donald Trump and his loyalists within the Republican Party. While not all of these figures are hyping nicotine pouches, they are pushing some variant of the idea that men can reclaim a lost dominance through a hypercapitalistic (even fascistic) focus on achievement and the perfection of the body. “A man with nicotine, protein, caffeine, and creatine coursing through his veins is an unstoppable force,” Greg Price, the communications director at the State Freedom Caucus Network, a group that works to get conservatives elected to state legislatures, recently told Semafor . Some of the Zyn boosting by right- wing pundits is probably tongue (or Zyn) in cheek, or an effort to troll liberals. Obviously, most guys aren’t expecting to take over the world when they pop a Zyn. They’re just looking for a hit of nicotine, like millions of smokers all over the world. But the larger promise of male self-improvement through stimulants, supplements, organ meats , and the advice of supposedly successful internet entrepreneurs is a powerful one — powerful enough to have emerged as conservatives’ appeal to men in an election year. White men are losing ground to women and people of color in America, a host of right-wing influencers claim — but they can gain it back with exercising, eating, buying, working, and voting the right way. Obsessing over Zyn is “good right-wing politics,” said Eric Knowles, a social psychologist at New York University who studies political behavior. “I don’t know that Tucker’s truly passionate about nicotine pouches, but I do know that he knows that these pressure points exist in the male population.” Zyn is part of a new model of masculinity for Gen Z Zyn is not tobacco — it’s a small pouch full of nicotine salt , meant to be inserted between the lip and the gum for about an hour at a time. The product, which became widely available in the US in 2019, has skyrocketed in popularity thanks to some combination of convenience (no spitting, no smoking), a “fun” image (you can earn reward codes and trade them in for merch, as GQ notes ), and the endorsements of celebrities and influencers, most of them conservative or conservative-adjacent. It’s not clear how the right got Zyn-pilled, and Philip Morris International, which bought Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match in 2022, says it does not pay Carlson or any influencers. But the pouches have shown up throughout the larger ecosystem of bro-y podcasters and comedians like “ anti-woke” juggernaut Joe Rogan and Shane Gillis , who was fired from Saturday Night Live in 2019 for a history of racist and homophobic jokes. Perhaps the most visible boosters of the brand, next to Carlson, are the Nelk Boys, the Full Send hosts and YouTube pranksters who have hosted both Trump and Donald Trump Jr . When Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for a Food and Drug Administration investigation into the product, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) declared a “Zynsurrection” and Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC) posed with a Zyn can, writing , “Come and take it!” Fans like to ask conservative politicians to sign their Zyn cans. (As Vox’s Whizy Kim and Keren Landman have noted, there don’t appear to be any videos of people asking Bernie Sanders to sign their Zyn.) Philip Morris insists that the pouches are just an alternative to smoking, nothing more. “Providing adult smokers with better alternatives to cigarettes should not be political,” Samuel Dashiell, senior communications specialist for Philip Morris, told Vox in an email. “America’s approximately 28 million smokers come from all walks of life, and all of them should have accurate information and choices available to move them away from cigarettes.” The company has also said its product is not meant to treat erectile dysfunction. Nonetheless, the pouches have tapped into a precarious moment in American masculinity. Young men today are growing up in a time of enormous economic uncertainty, when many blue-collar, male-coded jobs have disappeared . If they’re unemployed, or have to take so-called pink- collar jobs in industries once associated with women, their sense of their own manliness can be threatened, Knowles said. Many experts also believe that social advances by women and people of color (as vulnerable as many of those advances may be) have made a swath of white men anxious that they are somehow falling behind. Tapping into ambient male insecurity are legions of influencers and content creators eager to teach young men how to be more successful, confident, muscular, and attractive, said Robert Lawson, a professor of sociolinguistics at Birmingham City University in the UK and author of the book Language and Mediated Masculinities . Their content may start out benign — workout tips and the like. But on TikTok especially, it’s “a gradual process of exposure to potentially more extreme content,” including the dehumanization of women and people of color and the message that “these people are the reason why your life is rubbish,” Lawson says. The message, as advanced in media like Carlson’s 2022 special The End of Men , is often that men and masculinity are under threat, and only a return to “traditional” values will save them. These values often include recommendations like eating steak and lifting weights, but also — implicitly or explicitly — keeping women in domestic roles and cracking down on immigration. At the same time, what today’s masculinity influencers are selling is different from the macho archetype of generations past. Young men today are subject to two sets of masculine norms, said Adam Stanaland, a postdoctoral researcher at New York University who studies how adolescents and young adults think about gender and other identity markers. There’s old-school machismo — a John Wayne-style emphasis on toughness and emotional repression — and then there’s a newer vision of masculinity that requires men to look attractive, be in shape, and otherwise perform at high levels. This is mascuzynity: Instead of being stoic and silent, it’s about hustling, working out, and relentless self-improvement. Even the partying is optimized. The new model of masculinity focuses intently on what men put into their bodies — the “nicotine, protein, caffeine, and creatine” of it all. TikTok influencer the Liver King, for example, built a following of millions with his large physique and his diet of “beef brains, bull testicles and raw animal livers,” according to the Washington Post , before admitting in 2022 that his muscles were actually the result of steroids. If beef brains and bull testicles will help men build the perfect masculine physique, the theory goes then Zyn and other stimulants will help them get things done. Carlson has called it “a powerful work enhancer.” Daily Wire podcaster Michael Knowles has opined that Zyn is “actually what Neuralink will feel like,” referencing Elon Musk’s brain-computer interface company. “It feels like you’re just taking an electrical charge and plugging it into your brain stem.” A gateway to right-wing politics These messages have easily shaded into more disturbing forms of misogyny and white male supremacy, Lawson said. Tate, for example, ran an online course called Hustler’s University in which he claimed to educate viewers on drop-shipping and cryptocurrency ; he also talked continually about assaulting women. He has now been charged with rape and sex trafficking. Other figures meld bodybuilding advice with reactionary politics, like the Golden One, a Swedish fitness influencer who shows off his long blond hair and muscles while railing against “cultural Marxism” and “beta-leftists.” The Golden One “gets held up as an exemplar of ideal white masculinity” — a vision of the white man as defender of his family and country “against multiculturalism, immigration, the degradation of Western culture,” Lawson said. The pull of mascuzynity also has the potential to influence voting behavior. Trump is perfectly aligned with the new masculinity — despite his checkered business history , he has promoted himself as the ultimate entrepreneur, a strong, successful businessman who breaks the rules and gets things done. The story Trump tells about himself is “a really appealing brand to young men” who don’t want to be part of any corporate entity or political machine and see him as similarly rebellious, Stanaland said. Trump has also tapped into the widespread insecurity that recessions and unemployment have wrought among men, especially working-class men who are more likely to have lost jobs, NYU’s Eric Knowles said. His research has found that men who felt insecure in their masculinity were more likely to vote for Trump in 2016 and for Republicans in post-2016 House elections. The effect was not seen in elections before 2016, which suggests that it stems from Trump’s particular brand of politics. “He’s like a caricature of overperformed, stereotypical masculinity,” Knowles said. “A man who’s feeling fragile in his masculinity is going to look at this and say, ‘Well, if I align myself with this paragon of manhood, that will reflect positively on my own manhood.’” In this context, it makes perfect sense that conservative commentators are pushing Zyn and other products and practices that aim to help men recover a supposedly lost virility. “Zyn becomes this kind of hallmark of all of these idealistic male attributes,” Lawson said. “You can be master of your own universe. You can set up your own business and you can make loads of money and you can run for president and you can solve all the world’s problems.” There’s some evidence that young men are growing more conservative around the world. Trump currently has an edge with American men, with 53 percent saying they’d vote for the former president in a recent Quinnipiac University poll , compared with 42 percent who said they’d pick Joe Biden . Philip Morris may assert that Zyn itself is apolitical, but if Trump does retake the White House in November, mascuzynity may have had a hand in getting him there. What that means for Democrats, and for American men in general, is murkier. When it comes to the impact of male insecurity on elections, it’s unhelpful to blame individual men, Knowles said. “Men are being manipulated politically.” “Within some pockets of culture in the US, there is a very narrow lane of what it means to be a man,” he said. Changing that is about loosening social strictures and allowing men “to define manhood and masculinity however feels right to them.” “That’s not a political strategy, though,” Knowles said. “That’s a long-term social project.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Joe Biden is very old. He was born closer to the Battle of Gettysburg than the 2024 election . He was an adult before the JFK assassination and a senator before the fall of Saigon. And it shows. The 81-year-old president was never a pristine public speaker; he’s also struggled with a stutter for much of his life. But in recent years, Biden’s oratory has grown increasingly stilted and slurred, his gaffes more frequent. He recently referred to former German Chancellor Angela Merkel as Helmut Kohl (who left the German government in 1998) and Emmanuel Macron as François Mitterrand (who has not been the president of France since 1995). Shortly after these slips, special counsel Robert Hur released his report on Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents. Hur acknowledged that there was no strong case for prosecuting Biden — unlike Donald Trump , he promptly returned all classified documents in his possession upon the Justice Department’s request. But the report also made many editorial comments about the president’s cognitive capacities. It referred to Biden’s “faulty memory” and “diminished faculties,” and it claimed that he “did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died.” Hur is a veteran of the conservative legal movement, and most liberals saw his knocks on Biden’s mental acuity as pure political opportunism. But it nevertheless reinforced the public’s preexisting perception that Biden is too old for his job. The notion that Biden is less mentally fit for the presidency than Trump is extremely dubious. The president has been involved in public policy for more than half a century and Biden has almost certainly forgotten more about geopolitics and the federal bureaucracy than Trump has ever learned. Age notwithstanding, Biden remains far more cognitively qualified for the presidency than his 77-year-old rival, whose ignorance of (and incuriosity about) the details of federal policy has been exhaustively documented. The president’s mental competence is similarly well established. Last year, then- House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told allies that he “found the president sharp and substantive in their conversations,” as Politico put it . This comports with the assessment of Democratic insiders. And nothing in Biden’s public performance contradicts these reports of his private behavior. The president’s slip-ups have been verbal, not cognitive. When he described Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as “president of Mexico,” Biden quite clearly understood who Sisi actually was, and he proceeded to discuss issues of Israel -Egypt relations. He had simply misspoken, something that Trump does on a routine basis. Nevertheless, Biden’s current job is not merely to serve as president but to campaign for that position. And his fitness for the latter task is suspect — or so Ezra Klein argued last week in a much-discussed audio essay . Klein insists that Biden has been a good president and would continue to be one if given the opportunity. But he notes that Biden’s gifts for public speaking have diminished considerably over the last four years (a point he effectively illustrates by playing Biden’s 2020 campaign launch speech against his de facto 2024 one ). He seems much older today than he did then. Which is a problem, since more than 70 percent of voters are worried about his age, and Trump leads the president in national polls, according to Real Clear Politics. Democrats need a gifted campaigner to get back in the race, Klein suggests, and Biden simply isn’t it. Instead, he argues that the party would be better off if the president stepped down and let delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago choose whichever standard-bearer they deem most likely to deliver victory in November. Klein’s case that Biden is an unusually weak candidate is strong. His prescription for what Democrats should do about this is less so. The Democratic National Convention is in late August, and having a bunch of party insiders anoint a nominee less than three months before the convention is a risky gambit — arguably riskier than sticking with the incumbent. Fundamentally, though, the argument is moot. Biden is not going to drop out unless his party’s standing gets much worse (or his health greatly deteriorates). And even in that scenario, it’s doubtful that the party could nominate anybody in Biden’s stead but Kamala Harris , who looks no more competitive in the polls. Biden isn’t losing by enough to forfeit his lifelong dream Biden has spent much of the past four decades angling for the presidency. He first ran for the office in 1988 and then again in 2008 before finally securing the prize four years ago. By all accounts, he enjoys being president. People tend to be reluctant to relinquish enormous power. Doing so on the grounds that one is too old is especially psychologically difficult. Holding the presidency must be one of the most potent distractions from mortality in existence — the itinerary of a Delaware grandpa leaves far more time for contemplating one’s imminent death than that of a commander-in-chief. At this point, Democrats cannot replace Biden against his will. The Democratic primary is effectively over, and the president will bring an overwhelming delegate majority to his party’s national convention. If he decides that he does not wish to run for reelection, his delegates could back another candidate. Otherwise, they will surely hand him the nomination. Biden is leading Trump in national polls by roughly 2 percentage points. The president, according to Real Clear Politics, is slightly ahead in polls of Pennsylvania voters , slightly behind Trump in Wisconsin , and 4.6 points behind in Michigan . These numbers are deeply concerning, but they are not yet catastrophic. More to the point, they leave plenty of room for Biden to rationalize his ongoing presence in the race. For one thing, most pollsters are currently surveying all registered voters, rather than those who are likely to actually show up at the polls. This is significant, since polls have consistently found that Trump enjoys disproportionate strength among low- propensity voters (in other words, people registered to vote who don’t often cast a ballot). In December, Trump led Biden by 2 points in a New York Times/Sienna College poll of registered voters. But when the Times applied a “likely voter” screen to its results, it found that Biden led Trump by 2 points . Marquette University Law School’s surveys have shown a similar pattern. In that outfit’s September 2023 survey, for example, Biden trailed Trump by 3 points nationally with registered voters, but led him by 2 with likely ones. The president’s numbers in Michigan are concerning. It’s fairly easy to discount swing-state polls this far from Election Day, which tend to have higher margins of error than national surveys. Meanwhile, in special elections, Democrats have been trouncing Republicans throughout the past year. But personally, I don’t find these considerations especially comforting. It’s true swing-state polls have been wrong the past couple of cycles. But in the Rust Belt, they’ve been wrong in Democrats’ favor. In 2020, polls showed Biden winning Michigan by as much as 8 points . His actual margin was 2.8. Further, the Democrats’ strength in special elections could be totally compatible with Biden’s grim poll numbers being accurate. Special elections aren’t very predictive of general election outcomes. Nevertheless, Trump’s relatively narrow polling advantage, Biden’s strength with likely voters, and the Democrats’ electoral successes provide the president with plenty of reasons to believe in his own viability. The alternative to Biden is not obviously better for his party If Biden has cause to believe he’s still a contender, he also has grounds for doubting that his exit would increase the Democrats’ odds of victory. The party has no shortage of candidates who would plausibly outperform Biden at the top of the ticket, from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. But nominating anyone but the sitting vice president would invite a crisis of dissension and legitimacy. Passing over a Black female heir apparent would likely spur backlash from key segments of the party’s activist core, professional staff, and voting base. Just as importantly, only Harris could become the presumptive nominee ahead of the party’s convention and sail through relatively smoothly in a vote of the delegates. If Biden stepped down and endorsed Harris — imploring his delegates to vote for her — then Democrats could all begin aligning behind the party nominee before late August. It would not be tenable for Biden to endorse anyone else. Risky as it would be for convention delegates to pass over Harris through a formal, deliberative process, it would be even more incendiary for the president to snub her unilaterally. What’s more, as Biden’s running mate, Harris would be able to make immediate use of the president’s copious campaign funds, which currently total $130 million. As MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell has noted , no other replacement candidate would have legal access to that cash — at least, not until it passed through the Democratic National Committee’s coffers. If Democrats went into their convention without a presumptive candidate, they would also cede the airwaves to the Trump campaign for an extended period of time. After all, in the period between Biden’s exit and the convention, there would be no Democratic candidate to advertise for. Then, in late August, the party would effectively run a multiday advertisement of its own internal divisions. Fierce debates over both candidate selection and policy programs would rage in Chicago. Delegates chosen solely on the basis of their loyalty to Biden would find themselves suddenly transformed into power brokers of national importance. The last brokered convention predates even Joe Biden’s time in national politics. No one in the party actually knows how to run such an event. And even in the best-case scenario, Democrats would then have only 11 weeks to introduce their ticket to the country. For all these reasons, Harris is the only really plausible alternative to Biden. And her polling is just as bad as his, if not worse: One national survey taken last week found the president trailing Trump by 1 point, while Harris trailed him by 3. About 53 percent of Americans disapprove of Harris, while about 56 percent disapprove of Biden. The vice president’s electoral track record is also uninspiring. Campaign operatives typically judge politicians by how well they perform relative to their state’s partisan lean in presidential elections. In her first statewide election in 2010, Harris beat a Republican in the race for California attorney general by less than 1 percentage point. Two years earlier, Barack Obama had bested John McCain by more than 23 points in that state. In 2020, Harris began her run for the Democratic nomination with strong donor support and an early surge in the polls . Yet her campaign collapsed before the primary’s first ballots were cast. If Biden is roughly as unpopular as Harris but more than two decades older, then it might be wise to go with the younger standard-bearer. Biden’s strength in 2020 was that he functioned as a relatively generic Democrat, thereby focusing the public’s attention on Trump’s peculiar liabilities. Today, however, the president does not scan as a normal candidate so much as an extraordinarily old one. It seems possible that replacing Biden with Harris would be an improvement. Yet that isn’t remotely obvious to me — and more importantly, it isn’t obvious to Biden. Absent such clarity, there is little reason to think that the president would forfeit the job of his lifetime. A collapse in the president’s poll numbers might change his mind. But mere advocacy almost certainly won’t — liberal pundits are unlikely to force Biden from the race through sheer reason. In spotlighting Biden’s declining vitality, however, Democratic commentators risk persuading the public that he is unfit to run for president without convincing the man himself.

"2","In 2016, three years before comedian Shane Gillis was hired and then immediately fired from Saturday Night Live , he told an interviewer that he was experimenting with his comedy to see what he could get away with. “You can be racist to Asians,” he said . “That’s what we’re finding out.” He was confronted by the absurdity of this claim in 2019, when SNL fired Gillis for calling other comedians “f**got comics” and referring to Chinese people as “fucking ch**ks” on his podcast the year before. Yet since then, Gillis’s fame as a comedian has only grown. He’s been a repeated guest on Joe Rogan ’s hugely influential podcast. His own podcast boasts over 80,000 Patreon subscribers who reward him to the tune of at least $180,000 a month , making his show the most-subscribed show on the Patreon platform. He’s garnered support from contrarian comics like Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais . Last year, he even landed his own Netflix comedy special . Now, in what could be considered a comedy coup de grâce, Gillis is returning to Saturday Night Live this weekend — not as a cast member, but as a host . This about-face on the part of SNL might have its viewers believe that Gillis has atoned for his past sins. But Gillis hasn’t shown any interest in atonement. Quite the opposite, actually: “I definitely wouldn’t have changed what we did, our podcast,” he said in 2021 when asked what he’d do differently. Instead, he’s continued to use his comedy to be openly bigoted toward marginalized groups, continuing to engage in racist , anti-trans , anti-gay , antisemitic , and arguably white supremacist statements. He has, if anything, doubled down on his beliefs while comedy fans, advertisers , and media types moved on — including, it seems, SNL producer Lorne Michaels. In other words, what we’re “finding out” is that in 2024, Gillis’s brand of racism is more palatable than ever. When Shane Gillis tells you who he is, believe him Shane Gillis is a 36-year-old guy from Pennsylvania who was chasing a fledgling standup career when he began making inroads in 2016 through the medium of comedy podcasting. This included a stint hosting a show called A Fair One for Compound Media, a podcast network created by Anthony Cumia, a notoriously offensive shock jock known for his own racist comments . Compound Media also hosted Gavin McInnes, the white nationalist who rallied other members of the network together to form the Proud Boys , the extremist group that played a major role in both the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right rally and the January 6 insurrection . Compound Media was the platform on which Gillis dropped the racist slurs that ultimately got him dropped from SNL . But it wasn’t the only medium in which he aired his views. In his independent comedy work and other projects, he was not shy about voicing repugnant views. As one Philadelphia comedy club noted in 2019 in a since-deleted tweet , “We, like many, were very quickly disgusted by Shane Gillis’ overt racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia - expressed both on and off stage - upon working with him years ago.” In 2019, the comedy critic Seth Simons first drew attention to Gillis’s podcast racism after the announcement that SNL had hired Gillis. In February 2024, in response to the announcement of Gillis’s return to SNL , Simons compiled a list of discomfiting evidence for the LA Times supporting the idea that Gillis isn’t even being “ironic” about his use of racism in comedy — that he is, rather, plainly and truly a racist person. As Simons notes, the jokes Gillis made before he was famous, which included a litany of racist and antisemitic slurs and stereotypes, are so awful that “they should horrify us not because they are hateful but because they are full of joy.” As if all this wasn’t enough, Simons points out that alongside the rampant bigotry, Gillis has also voiced his unironic enthusiasm for McInnes, claiming that McInnes “crushes” his opponents in debate. Simons then goes on to explore all the offensive views Gillis has continued to share since his fame took off in 2019 following his SNL hiring-and-firing. These have most often been tucked behind the paywall of Matt and Shane’s Secret Podcast , which he hosts with fellow comedian Matt McCusker for the aforementioned 80,000 Patreon subscribers. These include a parade of unapologetically racist stereotypes and mockery, as well as ableist slurs and a whole array of anti-trans sentiments. With all of this context as background, Gillis’s cultural rehabilitation seems artificial, to put it mildly. A 2022 New Yorker profile glossed over Gillis’s self-described affinity for Trump, portraying him as “conciliatory” toward left-wing audiences while taking a “jovial but firm” approach in downplaying the unironic support of his right-wing fans. Gillis’s fans, including more liberal comedians like Jerrod Carmichael , seem to believe that rather than being actually racist, Gillis is consciously cultivating his offensiveness purely for the purposes of his comedy work. This view is as old as comedy itself , but in the current cultural era, it’s evolved into what NPR’s Eric Deggans has called “ bigotry denial syndrome .” The thinking goes that a comedic project has a certain level of importance and purpose, the level of which should both justify the offensive material and completely negate any suspicion that the comedian truly believes what they’re platforming, let alone that they deserve consequences for the offensive material. In Gillis’s case, it seems more accurate to say that he’s not performing ironic racism at all — he’s coasting on other people’s good faith belief that he must be acting totally in jest. Moreover, Gillis claims to use his comedy to draw attention to what he believes to be other people’s hypocrisy — but not in the way you might think. In that 2016 interview with Gillis, a portrait of him in the years well before he was famous, he claimed to be running experiments on his audience: “It’s funny what people will laugh at, compared to what they’re so eager to prove that they’re not laughing at.” Now, a full “cancel culture” cycle and legions of fans later, Gillis seems to have little need to bother being discreet. “If the blood rushes to my head, all my blood’s racist,” he said in a paywalled 2022 podcast episode, per Simons’s report. With all this in mind, the question then becomes: What the hell, SNL ? SNL ’s ambivalence toward Gillis ignores the harm this kind of comedy can cause According to Kelefa Sanneh’s New Yorker piece, SNL producer Michaels “was and is a fan of Gillis,” despite all the racism and anti-LGBTQ remarks and everything else. At the time SNL fired him, Michaels described Gillis’s previous comedy as “offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable.” However, Sanneh attributed Gillis’s firing not to his behavior but to “panic” on the part of NBC higher-ups. The conclusion we’re left with is that all that panic, as it so often does whenever someone is supposedly “canceled,” has subsided, likely to have dissipated in the wake of Gillis’s continued success. Vulture put forth two reasons for the hosting gig and its timing: that perhaps Michaels is trying to remain apolitical during an election year, and wants to do that by opening up a platform for comics who appeal to the right, and that “Michaels lives for the drama.” It’s worth noting that SNL 's long history of racism is well-known ; it took the show until 2019 to welcome a Chinese comedian in the form of Bowen Yang, who ironically was hired alongside Gillis. The reality is that this plausible deniability around bigotry is exactly what has enabled the spread of extremism throughout the last decade. It simply is not the case that you can perform racism for entertainment without catching real bigots in your net and affirming to them everything they want to believe — which is that these views aren’t just acceptable, they are mainstream — after all, they’re being voiced by a celebrity. Even if the celebrity disavows the worst of his fans in public, when he steps behind a paywall and then, for example, repeatedly platforms Holocaust deniers , those previous apologies and denials become irrelevant. Meanwhile, for the rest of us, every time another comedian like Gillis, Chappelle, or Louis CK gets welcomed back into the fold of mainstream comedy culture (if they were ever expelled to begin with), it becomes harder to convince detractors that bigotry is bigotry, no matter what kind of “humor” it’s wrapped in. When someone like Gillis can successfully promote the idea that of course we’re all secretly laughing at his bigoted jokes, his lack of remorse, together with his industry’s willingness to look the other way, becomes a broader form of gaslighting — appearing on America’s premiere network comedy show, live from New York this weekend.

"2","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has unveiled his most detailed plans yet for the future of Gaza . However, there is a problem: The plans are both wildly out of step with what the US wants and would generate significant opposition within Gaza and worldwide. Netanyahu has been under increasing pressure to develop a long-term plan for Gaza as Israel’s military operations in the region approach their sixth month. In response to Hamas ’s October 7 attack on Israel and its taking of roughly 250 hostages, the Israeli military campaign has destroyed large swaths of Gaza and has killed nearly 30,000 Palestinians , according to the latest figures from the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel is reportedly contemplating an escalation of hostilities with an attack on the southern city of Rafah , now home to more than 1 million internally displaced Palestinian refugees. Netanyahu reportedly told members of Israel’s security cabinet Thursday night that, after eliminating Hamas — the Israeli government’s stated, likely impossible goal in its war on Gaza — he wants to completely demilitarize Gaza, close its border with Egypt (which Egypt currently administers), and exert “security control over the entire area west of Jordan,” including Gaza and the occupied West Bank . CNN reported that the plan also calls for cutting off funding to Gaza from Qatar (which has previously sent Gaza as much as $360 million per year to fund its Hamas- controlled government with Israel’s endorsement) and for Israel to preside over a “de-radicalization” of the Palestinian education system, which Netanyahu has accused of spreading antisemitism. And Netanyahu said that Israel should reject “international dictates regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians” in defiance of US President Joe Biden’s calls for a two-state solution . Netanyahu might not survive as prime minister long enough to see this plan implemented, given increasing Israeli calls for a change in leadership . But it’s not clear that any successor would embrace a radically different plan. And it’s a plan that would put Israel at odds with a world that’s beginning to sharpen its critiques of the war as the suffering in Gaza deepens. “Now, it’s possible that by sheer force and indifference to international law, Israel could move forward with a total military occupation of Gaza — but if they do, the result will be morally unconscionable and accelerate the spiral of harms caused by the Gaza war, including death, humanitarian misery, and regional war,” said Thanassis Cambanis, who focuses on Middle East issues as director of the think tank Century International. Netanyahu is out of step with Israel’s allies — and the reality on the ground How to end the war in Gaza has been a point of friction between Israel and the US, its closest ally. Back in December, the Biden administration told the Israelis to wrap up the war in a matter of weeks, not months, and pushed for the creation of a Palestinian state governed by the Palestinian Authority, which currently controls the West Bank. More than two months have passed, and Netanyahu’s postwar plan shows that the US is no closer to securing that two- state solution. That’s despite agonizing negotiation efforts that the US continues to pursue amid growing international calls for a ceasefire. For the third time since the war started, the US vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire earlier this week on the basis that it would hamper ongoing negotiations. But the US also said it would back a resolution supporting a temporary ceasefire, which is further than it was willing to go before — signaling that American goodwill may be running out. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the plan. Netanyahu’s postwar plan tests the limits of American goodwill. It’s so far from the US position that it may be designed more to send diplomatic signals than to be a blueprint for future policies . Israel is currently engaged in intense (and so far fruitless) negotiations meant to return the estimated 132 hostages still held by Hamas and its allies. Netanyahu is under rising domestic pressure to secure a hostage deal, and he may be using this plan as a demonstration of how far Israel is willing to go in order to force those at the negotiating table to take Israel’s hostage proposals — which could lead to a cessation of hostilities — more seriously. There’s also a question of how operationally feasible this plan even is. It would require buy-in from Egypt, which it’s not clear Israel has, especially given Egyptian officials’ recent threats that they might withdraw from their landmark peace treaty with Israel, the Camp David Accords. And the plan necessitates that Israel eliminate Hamas by sheer force, a goal that even one top Israeli official admitted to be unrealistic . Israel says it has eliminated more than half of Hamas’s military units in Gaza, but some top Hamas brass, including the group’s leader Yahya Sinwar, have proved elusive . At the same time, Israel has already changed the status quo in Gaza in ways that may have once seemed far-fetched. Over half of Gaza’s buildings had been destroyed by early January, and that was before the Israel Defense Forces expanded their operation into the south; the United Nations’ humanitarian chief described Gaza as uninhabitable just three months into the war. Shipments of food and medicine have plummeted to a fraction of what they were before the war, reporters have been killed and forced out , and the US has defunded UNWRA , one of the largest sources of aid in Gaza. “Make no mistake — what Netanyahu is proposing is the complete destruction of Palestinian society and self-determination in Gaza, and the imposition of an open-ended military occupation,” Cambanis said. If the plan is implemented, Cambanis said to expect Palestinians to oppose any attempt to divide Gaza into isolated occupation zones controlled by the Israeli military and run not by Palestinian leaders with local legitimacy but by administrators selected by Israel. That wouldn’t mean the end of the fighting, but rather would fuel further hostilities in which more Palestinians would die, supporting South Africa’s claim at the International Court of Justice that Israel is committing genocide. “Palestinians, whether or not they support Hamas, will support resistance — civil, political, and military — to the violent evisceration of their society,” Cambanis said. “Netanyahu’s plan will certainly buttress the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has been all but openly running for vice president for several years, but her campaigning has become increasingly overt in recent weeks. For instance, during an interview with Fox News earlier this week, she laid out what qualities she believes Donald Trump’s vice presidential candidate should have, all of which just happen to be traits she routinely advertises as applying to herself: “ready to go on day one, not from the swamp, has run a small business and balanced a checkbook, has been a commander in chief, and someone who has his back and has never wavered.” Her top spokesman, Ian Fury, went so far as to post a list of those qualities on X — each adjacent to a green checkmark that presumably communicated that Noem meets each of those qualities. When local South Dakota outlet KELO inquired what Noem had meant by those remarks, and whether they had implied that Noem herself possessed those qualities, Fury said, “The Governor’s remarks in the interview and my post speak for themselves.” On Friday, Noem made her pitch in front of a filled room at the main stage of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) for why Trump should choose her as his running mate. Noem has been a mainstay at CPAC since 2021, having raised her national profile the previous year for her prescient decision to never shutter South Dakota businesses due to the pandemic. . In her speech Friday, she continued that strategy of using her record in South Dakota to position herself as the person best-suited to be Trump’s vice president. She noted South Dakota’s extremely low unemployment rate, population growth, AAA credit rating, paid-off debts, strong pensions, lack of fees for concealed carry permits, highest birth rate in the nation (“People are having babies, and I love it”), and recently lowered 4.2 percent sales tax. She argued that the means through which she created this successful environment were promoting freedom and not infringing on South Dakotans’ lives. “It is the job of the government to empower people to do things for themselves,” she explained. Noem then put forward South Dakota as a blueprint for the rest of the country and urged her listeners to vote for Donald Trump in order to effect that model nationally. “If America wants to be great again,” she concluded, “I suggest you look at South Dakota and see all that we have achieved and then vote for president Trump.” Noem has a major chance at becoming Trump’s running mate. New York magazine currently lists her as the most likely option, and she ranks the same in the betting market. But CPAC seemed much more enamored by unsuccessful Arizona gubernatorial candidate and now Senate candidate Kari Lake; it picked her first in the CPAC vice presidential straw poll, and Noem followed far behind in sixth place. Cheers for Noem during her speech were loud but not extraordinarily enthusiastic. Perhaps the South Dakota governor is not populist and anti-establishment enough for that particular crowd. Noem tried to turn another factor in her favor during her speech at CPAC: the fact that she declined to run for president and instead endorsed Donald Trump. The other candidates who had attempted to take on the former president, she asserted, were just trying to take the spotlight for themselves. “So why did all of these other people and candidates get into the race? For themselves? For personal benefit? For a spotlight for a period of time?,” she asked. It had been known since last year that Trump was the only candidate who could win the support of the Republican Party, she asserted. Some of Noem’s foremost vice presidential competitors indeed ran or are running against Trump during the primary race, including Vivek Ramaswamy, Tim Scott, and Nikki Haley. Other competitors include Elise Stefanik and Byron Daniels. By far the biggest obstacle to Noem in her quest to become Trump’s running mate is her alleged years-long affair. The affair is particularly embarrassing because of who it was allegedly with: Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager. In response to the Daily Mail’s planned publication of an article chronicling the affair — “EXCLUSIVE: Married South Dakota governor Kristi Noem and Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski have been having a years-long clandestine affair” — Noem at first “issued a statement attacking [the Daily Mail ] for the timing of the article,” the publication has asserted. However, Noem later decided to issue a full-throated denial of the affair. Luckily for Noem, this is probably the time in American history when it is least damaging for a politician to have engaged in an extramarital affair.

"2","Houston, the US is officially back on the moon. On Thursday, an unmanned lunar spacecraft called Odysseus made the first US moon landing in 50 years. The spacecraft, which was produced by Texas-based engineering firm Intuitive Machines, marks major progress in the country’s ongoing investments in space exploration and provides helpful new data that can be applied to upcoming lunar missions, and even trips to Mars. Odysseus is also the first private spacecraft to ever land on the moon, underscoring how American businesses are taking a more prominent role in US space endeavors. Their interest and involvement in space has meant the ability to test more technology more quickly, something that has been evident in SpaceX’s rocket launches , including repeated failed missions. Bolstered by government funding and a faster-moving experimental mentality, these companies are able to refine their offerings at a swifter pace than a government agency, which might often have to deal with more regulations and red tape. “We’re seeing quite a large growth in the number of companies and private interests in the space business,” said Johns Hopkins University physics and astronomy professor Charles Bennett. While private companies have long been key partners for NASA , Bennett said they’ve taken charge of more aspects of space exploration in recent years. SpaceX , for example, has become a key developer of rockets and intends to launch its own commercial missions. Additionally, the industry as a whole has seen a surge in growth and funding as more governments and consumers across the globe have become increasingly interested in space. Odysseus’s successful journey will ultimately be useful to scientists as they prepare for NASA’s manned Artemis missions, set to travel around the moon in 2025 and land there in 2026 . Those missions are dedicated to establishing a long-term US presence on the moon, with the goal of using that experience to inform later journeys to Mars. The moon landing, explained Odysseus, a robotic spacecraft, touched down in the region of the moon’s south pole on Thursday evening following a somewhat rocky descent . Intuitive Machines announced then on X that it was working to “downlink the first images from the lunar surface.” Notably, Odysseus is an autonomous spacecraft, which means it was able to land itself on the moon, a challenge that has foiled numerous past missions . After troubleshooting communications, flight controllers have confirmed Odysseus is upright and starting to send data. Right now, we are working to downlink the first images from the lunar surface. — Intuitive Machines (@Int_Machines) February 23, 2024 Odysseus will stay on the moon for about one week before it’s expected to run out of power. As part of the trip, it brought six scientific experiments for NASA, including one designed to test navigation capabilities, and six commercial items, including a sculpture by artist Jeff Koons . The vehicle is the first from the US to make this landing since Apollo 17 in 1972. More recently, China and Japan have also landed rovers on the moon. This mission was made possible by NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program and is set to aid the agency’s broader Artemis initiative, which is focused on using research on the moon to inform future missions to Mars. For this project, Intuitive Machines received $118 million in funding from NASA to build the lunar lander and transport experiments. A renewed focus on the moon is driven by both commercial and scientific interests, Bennett noted. For companies that are interested in space, there could be goals of mining minerals and other resources on the moon, he says. For scientists , it could be an opportunity to study the presence of water on the moon and how it could help fuel trips to Mars. ( As ABC News Australia reported , frozen water at the moon’s south pole could be used to make fuel, a potentially helpful prospect for astronauts in the future.) “It’s really exciting,” Geza Gyuk, the director of astronomy at the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum, told CBS News . “It’s part of the Artemis Project, so this is sort of testing out the technologies necessary to deliver payloads to the moon.” Additionally, these missions are taking place against an ongoing backdrop of geopolitical competition with entities including the Chinese government, which has seen three spacecraft land on the moon in the span of a decade. “It is a fact: we’re in a space race,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson previously told Politico about the urgency behind the US establishing a presence on the moon. What this means for space exploration In addition to Intuitive Machines, several other companies, including Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos ’s Blue Origin, and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, are working on tech and vehicles for taking the next steps in space. Between 2013 and 2022, private equity firms poured $272 billion into more than 1,700 private space companies, according to a Deloitte report . And the industry is only expected to grow in the next decade. For now, Bennett notes that the interests of private companies and the public sector have intersected, with companies helping NASA conduct scientific experiments. He said, however, that one day those could potentially conflict. At this time, the moon landing has been touted by officials as a milestone for the current private endeavors as well as public ones. “Today, for the first time in the history of humanity, a commercial company, an American company, launched and led the voyage up there,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a video statement . “This feat is a giant leap forward for all of humanity.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","They’re the cohort that gets a lot of media play — fastest growing, now tallying over 30 percent of the population, a fertile demographic waiting to be plucked, recruited, enlisted, politically seduced. They are the “nones.” Let’s be honest; we conservatives have written them off. They’re young — 65 percent are under 50 years old — and make up a lot of millennials and Gen Zers (44 percent of millennials and 45 percent of Gen Z are nones). And they’re out there — pro-abortion, pro-gay, pro-trans climatistas . Why, they’re probably throwing back a Bud Lite and selecting “tuck-friendly” swimwear from their local Target to wear while gluing their hands to the Interstate even as we speak. We’ve got no shot with them. But is it true? Conventional wisdom would say so. Nones comprise three groups — atheists, agnostics, and people who adhere religion-wise to “nothing in particular.” Which is not to say, of this latter category, anti-religious, nor even non-religious. They simply don’t belong to an organized spiritual group. The atheists truly do not represent a ripe constituency for conservative pickup. They’re 5 or 6 percent of the voting public, and in 2020 they went 87 percent to 9 percent for Biden. Religion pollster par excellence Ryan Burge, in an interview with Mark Tooley, said: Atheists are the most liberal religious group in America today…. Atheists are loud and proud about how liberal they are…. The atheists over the last four years actually see themselves turning to the left, like towards the very liberal side, and they actually see the Democratic Party moving towards the middle. Agnostics — atheists lite — are not much more pliable to the conservative plow. Another 5 or 6 percent of the electorate, they pulled the lever in 2020 at an 80 percent clip for the elderly man with a suspect memory. That leaves 18 to 20 percent of the population in the “nothing in particular” category. Alas, they, too, look left for their political options. A Pew Research survey put 62 percent of them as Democrat or leaning Democrat. A substantial 82 percent of nones consider themselves either moderate or liberal, compared to a shockingly sparse 15 percent who say they’re conservative. But that 62–38 split (Democrat v. Republican) is not set in stone. In 2016, for example, while the nones broke for Hillary Clinton, the numbers were only 55 to 45. Burge opined on why that happened: [Trump] was a guy like them, who was the outsider, like, “I represent you, no one’s representing you, and I’m representing you and I’m going to shake Washington up because it’s not working for you.” And a lot of these “nothing in particular’s” are anti-institution, right? Society’s not working for them, they like outsiders. In 2020, however, the nones reverted to Democrat form, primarily, according to Burge, because Trump didn’t deliver — he didn’t shake up Washington, didn’t “drain the swamp.” He turned out to be just another pol. But the point is that votes of the nones are gettable. Evangelicals constitute a similar percentage of the population as the “nothing in particulars” (excluding atheists and agnostics) — about 21 percent — and retaining the evangelical vote is almost a Republican obsession. But, says Burge, “No one’s talking about the ‘nothing in particular’ vote … but if you can swing 5% of the ‘nothing in particular’s’ in your direction, that can mean the difference in a swing state.” The upcoming presidential election figures to be agonizingly close, with most pundits placing the outcome on the teeter-totter that is the seven swing states. Polls in those states currently favor Trump, but, as David Catron points out , the Dem-friendly election laws that ushered Biden into the White House in 2020 in five of those states are still on the books, thanks to Democrat governors who “refuse to protect the integrity of their elections.” Add that to the fact that few voters seem to be open to changing their minds, and their votes, and we may see a reprise of 2020, with slim majorities in a few states providing the difference. The race for the George Santos seat in suburban Long Island underlines how difficult prevailing in 2024 will be. The Democrat, Tom Suozzi, won the special election for the seat vacated by the disgraced Santos, expelled from the House in December, by a substantial 8 points. And he won it by employing a strategy that attacks Republican vulnerability and seems ripe for duplication. He emphasized abortion and anti-Trump rhetoric to energize his base, then wandered into Republican territory for the crossover vote by hitting the immigration issue. He called for a more secure border and praised the recently quashed Senate immigration bill endorsed by Democrats. A liberal, he posed as tough on the border! If a Democrat can take a Republican issue — some say the Republican issue in 2024 — and make it a political winner in a suburb of New York City, where the immigration failures of the current administration are on ready display — for example, with attacks on police by newly arrived immigrants that go viral — it spells big trouble for Republican chances in 2024. Every vote will be valuable in the upcoming election, and the races in all sectors — in the House, in the Senate, and for the presidency — will likely be extremely tight; any victory for conservatives may balance on a razor’s edge. Any inroads made by Republicans in any sector of the voting public could prove crucial in 2024. The “nones” don’t seem a particularly fertile field of votes for the party, but the nones may have become as liberal as they’re going to be. As Burge says, “they’ve kind of hit the ceiling when it comes to drawing in liberals.” It will be a challenge, for certain, but Republicans might be able to shave off a few percentage points from that voting body. Trump can still speak to this demographic. He’s an outsider once again, a candidate going up against the bureaucracy, and an anti-institutionalist, just like a lot of the nones. And the system is fighting him with everything it has. That might be enough to convince some “nones” to vote R. And that might be enough to carry a swing state or two."
"1","Editor’s Note: This is the fourth installment of Scott McKay’s new novel, King of the Jungle , which is being released exclusively at The American Spectator in 10 episodes each weekend in February, March, and early April, before its full publication on Amazon later this spring. So far in the story, our narrator Mike Holman, an independent media man and podcaster, has just agreed to write a biography and work as a public-relations consultant with his friend and old college roommate, the billionaire industrialist Pierce Polk — only to find that Polk has built a small city in the jungles of Guyana as a redoubt away from the corrupt Joe Deadhorse administration back home in America. Holman visits Liberty Point, Polk’s sanctuary under construction, and then joins him in Georgetown, the Guyanese capital, for a meeting with the country’s president… April 30, 2024, Georgetown, Guyana Mathilda took me up the elevator to the top floor of the Marriott, and there I found the presidential suite. Which really was the presidential suite, of sorts, because apparently it was permanently rented out for the president. And when we arrived, I met a pot-bellied little guy with a droopy face wearing a seersucker suit and — I’m not kidding — a sash draped across his body from one shoulder. “Mike Holman,” said Pierce, “this is President Mahandas Ishgan.” “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Holman,” Ishgan said. “I’m a fan.” “That’s quite a compliment, sir,” I said. “I had no idea my little podcast had an audience all the way down here.” “Oh, yes,” he said. “Yes, indeed.” I knew he was lying. He was a politician, after all. But as lying politicians went, he was one of the most polite. “Shall we adjourn to the dining area?” asked Ishgan. “We’ve much to discuss.” “Of course,” said Pierce. “But wait. Don’t we have one more coming?” “We do,” said Ishgan, rolling his eyes. “The Prime Minister will be here … when he gets here. We can begin without him.” “The Prime Minister and the President are political enemies,” Polk explained. “It’s fun watching them hate on each other.” “He was once President,” said Ishgan. “He was removed in a corruption scandal. But he’s in the middle of a comeback and he’ll run against me in the next election.” “Then why is he invited to this meeting?” I said as we sat down at the dining table set out on a large balcony covered by an awning. A couple of servers brought glasses of beer and chilled shrimp with a red sauce. Ishgan looked at Pierce. “It’s Banks Beer,” Pierce said. “Stuff is terrific. It’s becoming my favorite.” “So Pierce invited your PM,” I chuckled. “Always ask for forgiveness rather than permission, right Pierce?” “The things we’re going to talk about, everybody in Guyana will need to be engaged in them,” he said. “It’s only fair.” Just then an elegant, but quite old, bald-headed man with a caramel complexion and a thin gray moustache made his way to the table. “I apologize for my tardiness,” he said as we all stood. “You must be Mr. Holman. It is nice to meet you, Sir. I am Moses Jaganoo.” I shook his hand and then we all sat down. Ishgan was glaring at Jaganoo, who was ignoring the politician who was, at least nominally, his boss. Gonna be one hell of an election, I thought to myself. “Your meeting, Mr. Polk,” said Ishgan. “All right,” Pierce said. “Listen, first of all, I should explain that Mike is here as an advisor. His company is consulting with Sentinel Holdings about our public relations, but he’s also probably the smartest guy in the room and I want him to give us something of an outside opinion about what we’re going to discuss. Are you guys OK with that?” “Naturally,” said Ishgan. Jaganoo waved his hand in acquiescence. “Then fine. So as you’ve likely heard by now, I’m going to set up residence as a Guyanese pretty much permanently owing to the…” “Outrageous,” said Jaganoo. “I must believe it will be sorted out in time,” said Ishgan. “You surely have access to the finest legal counsel.” “You’d think so,” said Pierce. “But something interesting is happening, which is that we’re finding ourselves being turned down by a lot of the big New York law firms. It seems they’ve put the word out that I’m untouchable. And not in a good way.” “Well, that’s news,” I said. “I’ll find somebody,” said Pierce. “But it seems like I’m not in very good odor with the people who run my country at the moment.” “Again, outrageous,” said Jaganoo. “I believe we can get our parliament to extend Guyanese citizenship to any of your men and their families who desire it,” said Ishgan. “We would be delighted to have you.” “Given the contributions Sentinel has already made and will be making to our economy,” said Jaganoo. Ishgan nodded enthusiastically. Pierce shot me a sideways look, and it dawned on me at that point that he’d bribed the shit out of both of these guys. “So the thought is this,” said Pierce. “Mike, what do you think of us putting up a website that would process applications for Guyanese citizenship to any American who wants to come and then advertising it on independent media all over the country?” “Depends,” I said. “Who and how many are you looking for?” “We’ve got room for 10,000 at Liberty Point right now,” he said, “or at least we’ll have it inside of six weeks or so. Construction’s going really well. Better than we expected when you were last down here.” “I imagine you’re going to want folks who are, sort of, hardier souls,” I said. “You’ve got to be outdoorsy to really enjoy Liberty Point,” Pierce said. “These guys are gonna be hunters, gun owners and, we hope, military vets.” “Venezuela,” I said. “Are you still thinking they’re not coming?” “The threat is not diminishing,” said Ishgan. “Which is why we’re going to need to get Guyana caught up,” said Pierce. “Meaning weapons?” “We have no air defense capability,” said Jaganoo. “And our naval capacity is quite meager.” “OK, let me get my head around this,” I said, “because I’ve not done my research on this situation. The Venezuelans want to annex Essequibo, which is, what? The western two-thirds of the country?” “That’s correct,” said Jaganoo. “They would have everything west of the Essequibo River.” “So across the river from here would be Venezuela, or … no, that’s wrong.” “That is the Demerara River,” said Ishgan, pointing out of the window to the mouth of the river just west of the hotel. “The Essequibo is not far to the west of here, though.” “OK. And if they came, they’d be rolling tanks in?” “Helicopters,” Pierce said. “It’s all jungle in Essequibo,” said Ishgan. “There are very few roads. In fact, there are no roads from Guyana to Venezuela other than the one which runs south through Brazil.” “So they’d be air-dropping troops in.” “And it’s likely a naval invasion,” said Jaganoo. “They would bring troops on boats along the Atlantic coast and into the Essequibo and land along the western shore.” I nodded. “I’m not a military expert,” I said, “but I’ve covered a few conflicts. It would seem like they’d turn this place into a very nasty battlefield.” “We are poorly poised for defense,” Ishgan said. “Wait a minute,” I said. “There is no way Venezuela invades here without drawing the U.S. in. Right? Isn’t that what’s stopping them?” “They don’t fear American involvement,” said Jaganoo. “They don’t think it’s coming, Mike,” said Pierce. “That’s insane,” I said. “Doesn’t Exoil have a pretty massive drilling complex off the coast?” “We’re going to meet Exoil’s guy running their operations here later today,” said Pierce. “Yeah, but the Navy would shut down any move they’d make on Exoil’s assets, right?” “They didn’t when the Venezuelans nationalized all of their assets in that country about 10 years ago.” “Yeah, but this is an actual invasion of another country,” I said. “If Deadhorse and his gang would throw a hundred billion dollars into stopping the Russians in Ukraine, they’d have to help here.” “We’ve received no guarantees,” said Ishgan. “In fact, your State Department is telling us that it is not confident that the legalities of the 1899 treaty are fully sustainable.” “What does that mean?” I asked. “The border between our two countries were established in negotiations between Great Britain, Russia and the United States,” said Jaganoo. “The British negotiated on behalf of Guyana while the Americans negotiated on behalf of Venezuela, with Russia as the intermediary. The Venezuelans have long since complained that your country sold them out.” “Did we?” “It doesn’t really matter,” said Pierce, “or at least it shouldn’t. The reality is that Guyana is a free country and Venezuela is a communist dictatorship. And this is right in our back yard.” “Hmmm. Wait, I remember reading not long ago that you guys were doing joint exercises with the Air Force, or the Marines, or somebody.” “We did,” said Ishgan. “But in the last month, it seems that American cooperation has simply evaporated.” “That’s concerning.” “So the plan is, we need to make this the hardest target we can,” Pierce said. “That’s why Sentinel Security is busy recruiting.” “Mercenaries?” “And we’ve opened up procurement offices in Belgium and Colombia,” he said, nodding. “MANPADs, small arms, mortars, artillery, choppers where we can. Plus the Argentines are kicking in with a bunch of their surplus gear.” “How soon is this invasion coming?” I asked. “We do not have a military intelligence capability,” said Ishgan. “We do not know for certain.” I looked at Pierce, who smiled. “They’re training troops just across the border,” Pierce said. “We’ve got a satellite kicking down real-time imagery.” It struck me that Pierce had more or less assumed control of the country. Ishgan and Jaganoo might have been nice guys, but clearly neither one of them had the first idea how to handle any of this, and they were both looking at Pierce with every question. Maybe as a means of keeping from looking at each other. “When it comes, if it comes,” Pierce said, “it’s going to be helicopters dropping troops in villages all around west of the Essequibo. We need to be able to shoot them down, so we’re trying to get trained shooters placed in all those places. And…” “Wait,” I said. “Mr. President, do you have a general in command of your army? And is he going to join this meeting, or…” Ishgan gave me a look I couldn’t discern. “There’s concern Brigadier Darke is, er, compromised,” Jaganoo said. “As such, our strategic discussions are being held at a level above his pay grade.” “Perhaps you should do more than that,” I said. “Compromised how?” “China,” said Jaganoo. “And perhaps Venezuela as well.” “I don’t understand.” “China is behind all of this,” said Pierce. “They want Essequibo, and they’ve already bought Venezuela to get it.” “And Brigadier Darke is bought off?” “I don’t know,” said Pierce. I looked at Ishgan, who was stone-faced. I got the impression he didn’t want to say anything in front of Jaganoo. “It’s going to take some time to figure out who the patriots are,” said Pierce. “I’m sure we have some in this room.” I noticed a very uncomfortable look coming from Jaganoo. Ishgan noticed it as well, and I think he noticed me noticing it, because he gave me a glance that said more than if he’d talked to me for a month. Lunch came, and for the first time in a while I noticed that Pierce wasn’t eating steak. Instead, we were eating bowls of pepper pot, which I was told was the national Guyanese dish. It was a thick, dark stew with chunks of mutton and a variety of peppers. I thought I was going to have a heart attack over the spice. “It’s pretty potent,” I said, downing the rest of my beer after the first bite. “You’ll get used to it,” said Pierce. “This has some cinnamon and nutmeg in it? Fantastic!” Ishgan agreed, slurping happily from his bowl. The meal ended, and then the conversation turned to a host of economic projects that Pierce was initiating. He’d bought a small port facility in Georgetown just upriver from the Baker Hughes plant that was servicing the offshore rigs and that was going to be Sentinel Port Management’s facility until he could build the bigger port across the river that he’d planned. He said Liberty Point was going to be the site of a sizable network security hub and server farm. There was the Sentinel Construction facility upriver from where we were. They talked about the mall he was building. And he was snapping up real estate all over the country. Ishgan and Jaganoo were like a couple of fan-boys letting him run the meeting; I noticed about an hour later that neither had objected to anything he said. “Well, fellas,” Pierce finally said, “I know I’ve monopolized your time this afternoon, and for that I’m sorry.” “That’s quite all right,” Jaganoo said. “A pleasure,” said Ishgan. Then the president invited Pierce to address the parliament the next day. He thanked him for that, and then he essentially dismissed Ishgan and Jaganoo. “Thanks, guys,” he said. “Let’s reconvene tomorrow. I’ll give that speech before I head back to Liberty Point.” And at that they both shot up from the table and made their way out. Then Pierce and I were alone. “You’re a lot further along here than I expected,” I said. “I’m an idiot, is what I am,” said Pierce. “Here I figured that this would be a great investment — it’s a free country, the locals are cooperative as hell…” “For sale cheap, you mean.” “Well yes, but it’s more than that. They like investment and they aren’t communists. You grease the wheels for ‘em, yes, but they’re actually interested in growing this place. And they know they have no idea what they’re doing.” “What about this Ishgan versus Jaganoo thing?” “Yeah, they hate each other and they’re going to run against each other next year. It doesn’t really matter who wins from our perspective.” “You’ve got them both on the payroll.” “I learned my lesson back in the States. If I’d been smart, I would have played both sides against the middle rather than going to war with Omobba, as disgusting as the thought of throwing in with communists is. I’m not making that mistake again down here.” “So how do you keep the Venezuelans out?” “I have no idea at this point. It’s like I said: it’s all China. The Chinese are in all those villages paying off Indian tribes, buying up mines and other stuff. They’re everywhere.” “You think Jaganoo is bought by the Chinese? I can tell Ishgan does.” “I wouldn’t be surprised if Ishgan was on their take too.” “This is a hell of a fix you’ve gotten yourself into.” “Not to mention I’m stuck here.” “What? The indictment?” “I have my suspicions about that. I think that’s also China.” “Shit, Pierce.” “Network security? We’re the only people who can consistently stop their hackers. Port management? We’re one of the last remaining competitors to the big Chinese firms. They’re trying to stop us from that interport rail project we’re working on in southern Mexico that would kill their investment in the Panama Canal. Telecom, construction … if they could get me out of the way they’d have a hell of a nice run.” “You think they have the Southern District of New York?” “I think they have Wall Street. And Wall Street wants me down for the count so I have no choice but to take Sentinel public and go away. So it’s hardball now.” “I imagine so. They’re going to seize your assets for sure at this point.” “They’ll try. We’ve done a pretty good job of offshoring everything that’s liquid, and most of our domestic assets are leased, rather than owned.” “You have cutouts?” “Yes, I do.” A little later, Tom Burnham, who was Exoil’s Vice President in charge of Guyana operations, paid a call at the presidential suite. He came by for a meeting with Pierce. “So you’re the new sheriff, I see,” said Burnham to Pierce, when we were sitting at the balcony table. “Regretting your new acquisition?” “Not yet,” Pierce said, “but who knows? How goes your effort to keep Madiera’s greasy hands off your rigs?” “We’re in a similar boat as you,” said Burnham. “We’re here and we’re committed, and that means we’re likely screwed.” “Seems like Madiera is aiming to un-commit you,” said Pierce. “We took on a Chinese partner. If nothing else, when the Venezuelans come we can sell out and recoup something.” “But the payoff,” I said. “What are you turning, a million barrels a day out there?” “Not quite yet. It’s about half that right now. But it’ll be a lot more than that when it’s fully developed. Twelve billion barrels, is the size of the reserve we’re looking at.” “Losing that would be a major hit,” said Pierce. “I noticed that your stock is losing altitude.” “We’ve definitely got some exposure,” said Burnham. “Houston is under pressure to negotiate an exit, but dumping these assets at a fire sale price would be tantamount to surrendering our status as the big dog on the porch in our own hemisphere.” “To the Chinese,” I said. Burnham looked at me and nodded. “And Madiera’s people are demanding that we license the whole block through their government if we want to continue producing. Which we won’t do. But it does create a problem if and when they come. They’re warning us we’ll be considered as pirates and they’ll confiscate our end of the block.” “I can’t understand why Deadhorse isn’t standing in the way of this,” I said. “It’s oil. His people won’t lift a finger to help an oil company,” said Burnham. “And we’ve fought off the institutional money demanding that we join the ESG cult, which makes us only slightly less objectionable than Pierce here.” “And it’s China,” said Pierce. “What, you think Deadhorse is bought on this?” “All those business deals with the idiot son of his?” said Burnham. “They were energy deals.” “All right,” Pierce said, pulling out a sheet of paper and handing it to Burnham, “Hal had me put this together for you. Try to get back to me with how much of this you guys can pull together.” “Who’s Hal?” I asked. “Colonel Hal Gibson, retired, United States Marine Corps, and head of security at Liberty Point,” said Pierce. I knew who Hal Gibson was. “And effective commander of the defense of Guyana, I assume.” “How many has he got, Pierce?” Burnham asked. “All told, like about 6,500. And counting.” “That’s half again what the Guyanese have.” Pierce nodded. “And a hundred times the capability.” “Pierce,” said Burnham, as he perused the document, “what kind of Navy contacts does Hal have?” “You mean the submarines,” Pierce said. “You’re getting a sub?” I asked. “We’re trying.” May 3, 2024, Liberty Point, Guyana It turned out that while I was in Georgetown the FBI had paid a visit to Holman Media. Tom had called Morris, who in his polite, old-school way, had shooed the agents out of the office. Then he’d recommended the attorney for the company to hire — a New York ball-buster by the name of Karen Lugowski who didn’t agree with a damn thing on our websites or podcasts, but hated the feds a lot more than she disliked us. I’d had to sign her retainer agreement via email while I was in Georgetown. I got Pierce to agree to foot her bill in person; he was in the room with me when the document arrived in my inbox. And when I came home, Karen had already flown in and was waiting in my office. “Lookit,” she said, “as your attorney I’m going to recommend that you stay far away from Pierce Polk. He’s on the list, and you’re going to be on it as well.” “The list? What list?” “Enemies. People who need to have bad things happen to them. He took off down to the jungle for a reason, you know. They aren’t going to let him back in, not while this gang is in office. And now you’re part of Polk’s crew so you’re a suspect.” “For what?” “It doesn’t matter for what.” “You’re a criminal defense lawyer. There has to be a charge.” She looked at me like I was a moron. I’d read online on the flight back that the feds had raided Pierce’s place in Telluride. It had been completely cleaned out but for a velvet painting of Elvis on the wall above the big fireplace in the den. And Pierce was not an Elvis fan, so that gives you an idea of just how much contempt he had going for these people. I’d also read that Joe Deadhorse’s approval rating had dived to 32 percent in one poll and 28 percent in another. A major airline, which had launched a TV ad campaign touting its diversity hiring for pilots, had just had a major crash on a runway in a big midwestern city in which a pilot, promoted from flight attendant and on her maiden commercial voyage flying a Boeing 787, overshot the runway and rolled the plane. Sixty people were dead and the airline’s stock had crashed 40 percent before it was backstopped by a huge buy-in from RedGuard Capital. “The real tragedy of this crash would be if it were to harm our commitment to diversity,” the airline’s CEO said. Less than six hours later a video of him posing naked with an alpaca made the rounds on Twitter; it had originally been posted at the OnlyFur fetish site. The guys at the website were all over this stuff, and Billy Ray had dropped a half-dozen hilarious memes about the CEO. It struck me that we were a little close to the edge making jokes after a deadly plane crash, and I planned on saying something about that with my team. We had a quick business meeting after I told Karen that my relationship with Pierce was a commitment made and not soon broken, and if that meant she’d be scoring with the big leaguers on fees, then so be it. At the meeting, I noticed that my folks were all smiles. They were energized. I cautioned the group that we really did want to take the high road, or at least try to, on our coverage of current events. But it was clear nobody was hearing that. The FBI’s visit had changed a lot of attitudes in that room. They were ready for war. “Last week’s podcast with Polk was the top traffic-getter in the history of Rumble,” said Colby. “Site traffic is absolutely on fire. And you’ve got three of your old books in the Amazon top 20 in the American Politics category. You’re a bigger deal now than you were when you did the ANN show.” “Ad revenues are way up, too,” said Megan. “Especially since we just nailed down three new deals — the Dodge City Steak Company, Patrick Henry Rifle, and El Dorado Boots.” Those were pretty good accounts. Megan was beaming. “Where’s all this coming from?” I asked. “Did something happen that I missed?” “It’s Pierce Polk,” said Tom. “He’s rapidly turning into a folk hero. And the more they do to him the more the public is taking his side.” Lindzey Luger, who had the early prime slot on ANN and was a hard-core partisan Democrat, had uncovered some video of Pierce at a party somewhere yukking it up with Donny Trumbull, and she’d played it while declaring this was proof there was a “right-wing conspiracy to destroy our democracy” in advance of the 2024 election. And somebody had put a microphone in front of Trumbull, who was heading into a courthouse in Chicago where he’d been sued for defamation of some woman that he’d been acquitted of sexually assaulting two decades earlier. Asked about the old video, Trumbull didn’t deny he knew Pierce. “He’s a hell of a guy,” he said, “and it’s a travesty what Deadhorse and Omobba are doing to him. You know this is all Omobba, right? Deadhorse doesn’t go to the bathroom without Omobba’s say-so.” Naturally, Trumbull saying that sparked the legacy corporate media into full outrage at the idea Deadhorse wasn’t his own man, and there were plaudits and kudos heaped on Lindzey for having uncovered the “cabal” that Trumbull and Pierce were forming to destroy our democracy. Every time any of these people said “our democracy,” it launched Colby into a furious diatribe. “That term describes nothing we Americans recognize!” he’d sputter. “And it definitely isn’t democracy any honest person would accept!” Boy, was Colby in high dudgeon over Lindzey Luger at our staff meeting. We all sat there smirking while the steam came out of his ears. All of this seemed like a pretty normal Monday in 2024 to me. Somehow, though, this media frenzy was turning me into a star. Tom told me 60 Minutes had called asking to interview me as “Pierce Polk’s last remaining link to the real world.” “Well,” I said after the buzz around the conference table died down, “I guess the next podcast will be a big deal then.” “What are we doing?” asked Melissa. “We’re going to show Liberty Point to the world, and we’re going to interview the folks building it.” “We’re OK to do that?” asked Kaylee. “Pierce is good with it? I thought it was a secret.” “Not anymore it’s not. And you and Melissa are coming, plus we’re taking Craig Clifford and his good video camera.” I’d wrangled Craig for the trip over the phone while flying in. That didn’t take much effort. Free-lance videographers tended to make themselves available whenever there was payment involved. “This’ll be big,” said Tom. “Huge,” said Colby. Then came a depressing night alone in my house, complete with a decision that I’d sell the place and just rent an apartment somewhere for a while. My next door neighbor had just sold her three-bedroom cottage for $1.2 million, which was double what I’d paid for mine 15 years before, and I figured that was a sign I should cash out. Besides, Buckhead was turning into a shooting gallery. A couple of days before I left for Georgetown, a couple of ballers decided to trade lead in the parking lot of the strip mall down the street. The ambulances managed to take them both to Grady before they bled out, but it was nonetheless enough to put the neighborhood on a hair-trigger. The next morning a car picked me up and Kaylee, Melissa, Craig, yours truly and an astonishing amount of luggage were flying out of Fulton County Airport on another private jet, this one a Bombardier Challenger 3500 owned by Leighton Industries — they were the manufacturer of Sentinel Telecommunications’ satellites, and Tom Leighton had openly come out to defend Pierce and decry the feds’ efforts to prosecute him. A few hours later, we landed at Connor Polk International Airfield in the middle of a torrential downpour. That was a little surprising given that the rainy season wasn’t supposed to start for another month. The plane taxied into a big hangar that hadn’t been there the last time I’d been to Liberty Point. “This place is a lot nicer than I thought it would be,” said Melissa, as we descended the little jetway and made for a picnic table at the far corner where snacks were laid out and a bartender was waiting to mix us drinks. “Oh, wait until you see the town,” I said. “You’re going to think you’re in Barcelona or Genoa. They did a great job with it.” I noticed that the Challenger shared the hangar with a couple of planes that looked a good bit like Predator drones. I decided to file that bit of data away for later inquiry — and when Craig asked if I wanted him to film that, I shook my head. “I’m imagining that has to do with Venezuela,” I said. “I don’t want it on my conscience if we give away any state secrets.” “Understood,” he said. The rain mercifully petered out while we sipped on capirinhas, and then a couple of Grand Cherokees rolled up into the hangar to fetch us. And soon after, I noticed that the road from the airstrip into the town looked a lot different this time. They’d landscaped it. The trees were cut quite a bit back, and somebody had planted shrubs off the shoulder of the road, I assume so as to serve as a barrier to the underbrush growing back. Plus, there were streetlights now. “Looks like America,” said Kaylee. “Yep,” said Craig, who had his video camera out and was shooting. And then we passed through the big wooden gate and the girls gasped. “I told you,” I said. “It’s got a European feel to it, dontcha think?” “I’d say it’s like New Orleans,” said Kaylee, “but then I’ve never been to New Orleans.” “I know it’s new,” said Melissa as we turned onto the main drag, which the newly- installed street signs identified as Sentinel Boulevard, “but it looks and feels old, like it’s been here for centuries.” “Maybe it has been,” said Kaylee, “in a sense. And maybe Pierce just brought it out.” “Probably unlikely, K,” I said. Melissa laughed. “OK, OK,” Kaylee whined. “Sorry.” A right and a left later, and our Cherokee brought us to the same building I’d stayed in on my previous trip. But it didn’t look the same; this time I noticed they’d planted trees and bushes everywhere, and there were canvas awnings set up like the tops of tents — I immediately knew those were rain shelters — at intervals on the sidewalks. And people. Liberty Point hadn’t had nearly this many people the last time. I asked the driver, a new arrival from Chicago named Bill, if he knew what the population of the place was now. “They announced it yesterday we just passed six thousand,” he said. “Most everybody’s here working for Sentinel Construction. There’s great money in it. So that’s why they’re all in work clothes.” “How many are staying when the project is finished?” Kaylee asked. “Probably everybody,” said Bill. “No taxes? No stupid government? This place is just going to grow and grow.” We parked, and I led my little team through the same entrance to the concierge that I’d seen before. “Welcome back to Liberty Lodge, Senor Holman,” said the pretty concierge lady that I remembered from my last trip. “Hey, Consuela!” I said. “This is Melissa Swindell, Kaylee Russo and Craig Clifford. They’re here with me to make this place famous.” “I heard,” she said. “Everyone here is talking about it.” A couple of bellmen, who I found out were members of the Patamona tribe who lived a few miles away in the village of Micobie, brought us up to what was Pierce’s suite the last time I’d been in Liberty Point. “Wait,” I said, “where’s Pierce?” “ Aimu’nang Waica ?” said the taller guy, whose name was Sam. “He’s at the new place.” “What’s the new place? And Eye- moon-ang Wa-ee-ka?” “It means White Warrior,” said Sam. “We gave him an honorary title.” “Well, that was nice of you.” “It was the least we could do,” said Lenny, the other guy. “He hooked up the whole village with cell service and satellite TV.” “It sounds like he’s spoiled your pristine tribal lifestyle,” Kaylee said, half joking. “Is this lady kidding me right now?” said Lenny, looking at me. “Yes, she is,” I said quickly. “OK, then,” he said, smiling at us. And Sam and Lenny set our bags down and waved goodbye as they took off. “Kaylee,” I said, “come on.” “Hey, I went to Dartmouth,” she said, “and I had a humanities class all about how European encroachment on native tribes is destroying their culture, and…” “And you believed that bullshit?” “You believe it if you want the ‘A,’” said Melissa. “OK, well, this isn’t college. But yeah, we’ll take a ride to Micobie and Mahdia and a couple of the other places around here and you guys can see what the indigenous folks think of their culture getting destroyed.” We got situated, then I recorded a couple of takes for an open of the podcast. I then got a message from Pierce inviting me to a meeting at his new place, which he said was a couple of blocks away along the Essequibo. I made my excuses to the rest of the team, as they were going to head out and explore Liberty Point and have Craig shoot a bunch of B-roll, and suggested that maybe we’d reconvene for dinner and go over our plans for podcast interviews we’d do the next day. Consuela hooked me up with a golf cart ride to the new place, which she said was the Grand Waica. A little guy who said his name was Earl — he was an Arawak from Campbelltown, a few miles west — was my driver. “Love your podcast,” he said as we took off. “You’re kidding,” I said. “How do you even know about it?” “Because we’re fans of everything Pierce Polk, and you’re part of that. Anything you need, you just call.” And he gave me a business card. It said Earl Roberts, Toshao Region Eight, Construction; Mining; Communications. “You’re a man of many talents,” I said. “Why are you driving a golf cart?” “Because the work’s easy and Pierce pays big. I also do drywall and some plumbing, too.” “What’s a toshao?” “Like a town captain, or maybe a mini-mayor, I guess.” “Got it.” Then we pulled up to a stately five-story building that looked like a hotel, which it was. “The Grand Waica” was chiseled above the large glass revolving door, and as I hustled inside I felt like I was transported to the Drake or the Plaza. I could see along the far wall, which was mostly glass, that some of the building laid over the Essequibo. There was a mini-marina of sorts were people could park boats in the shade of the Grand Waica. “Pretty cool, right?” said a friendly voice. I turned, and there was Roman Jefferson, the private security guy I’d met on my last trip. “Definitely. Hey, Roman, how’s it going?” “Great, Mike. Just moved into my place, and my girl’s comin’ in on Monday to join me. We got a three-thousand square foot condo with a balcony up the street. But the bar here is where it’s at.” “What exactly are you doing here?” I said. “Sorry if I’m being nosy.” “Call it a semi-retirement. But I’m helpin’ with, ummm … contingencies.” “Like the Venezuelans?” “Like that.” “Got it.” I didn’t get the impression Roman was going to tell me more. Or that I wanted to know more. So I found the elevator and rode it to the fifth floor, as Pierce’s text had instructed. When the door opened there was a huge guy in a tan suit waiting for me. “Come on through, Mr. Holman,” said the guy. He opened a door and there was Pierce, breaking off from a conversation with a group of people in a cavernous salon with windows overlooking the river. He was wearing jeans and a white t-shirt with “WAICA” in a bold font on it, and he flashed me a big smile. “Here he is!” said Pierce. “Everybody, meet Mike Holman!” There were probably two dozen people in the room at this cocktail party, or whatever it was, and they actually started applauding. I didn’t know what to make of that. Especially when I looked around and started recognizing some of the faces. The two Guyanese politicos nominally in charge of the country, Ishgan and Jaganoo, were there. So was Burnham, the Exoil executive. I recognized Ravi Darke, who was Guyana’s head general, from his photo. Pierce introduced me to a guy from Raytheon and another one from General Dynamics. The Brazilian and Argentinian ambassadors were there. And then there was Brienna Givens, the tennis player. I knew — or I had heard — that Pierce was seeing her, or at least to the extent that people like Pierce and Brienna would “see” anybody. But I could tell this was a real thing. She was sticking to him like glue. What a knockout she was. Easily my height, and I’m right at six feet, and athletic as hell. Brienna would have been a dead ringer for a young Elizabeth Hurley but for her lighter hair and the fact that she’s a little more masculine-looking, I guess. But wow. She’d done a lot of modeling, and she was good at it, but in the flesh Brienna was straight-up gorgeous. At least, until she opened her mouth. I didn’t get the idea that Brienna was all that excited to be at Liberty Point. She said in that half-reformed London cockney accent of hers that she was here because she had to be in Mexico in a few days, and that Pierce had insisted. Then she introduced me to Sarah, her sister. Who was a little older, not as tall, not quite as glamorous, but definitely more of a willing conversationalist. Maybe it was the fact that I’m somewhat famous, but I got the impression that Sarah was interested in me. I got that impression when, just after Brienna told her who I was, she leaned in and put her hand over my heart and said she could feel a good man was in there, deep down. “Thanks, I guess,” I said. She gave me a warm smile. I hadn’t gotten one like that since Ashley dumped me. At that point I was suddenly very curious about Sarah Givens. And that was just fine with Sarah, because she was quite keen to tell me all about her exploits. She said she was a photojournalist and the director of a nonprofit called EarthChampions. “Brienna is on the board,” Sarah said. “Costs quite enough,” said Brienna, and then I realized that Brienna was the board of EarthChampions. “Wait — your nonprofit is with the UN?” I asked. I remembered that there was something similar to the name that had to do with some climate change something-or- other. “Oh, no, love,” she said. “You’re thinking of Champions of the Earth. We’re not the same.” “Oh, you do something different?” “We do champion the Earth,” she said. “And how do you do that?” “We inform the public about abuses of the ecology, air and water pollution, the climate, deforestation…” “You’ve come to the right place, baby!” Pierce laughed. Sarah and Brienna gave him shitty looks for that. “Don’t agitate her,” said Brienna. “As I was saying,” Sarah said with an irritated tone, “I’m here to investigate the effect your Liberty Point is having on the rivers, the flora and fauna, and the culture of the indigenous people.” “Interesting,” I said, thinking to myself that Sarah’s professional exploits weren’t very interesting at all. “You know, the capitalists see pristine places like this one and insist on paving it over. I’ve seen it all over the world — Nigeria, Eritrea, Tajikistan, Vietnam…” “Vietnam is communist, though,” said Pierce. Sarah gave him a wicked side-eye. “I should think this place is no different,” she said. “Well, I’m sure you two will have lots to talk about,” Pierce said, leading Brienna off and giving me a devilish nod. Thanks a lot , my look in response told him. Sarah was saying that it was terrible that they’d disturbed the shore of the Potaro to build that hydroelectric power plant. “Oh, you mean the converted land dredges along the riverfront?” “Land dredges?” I nodded. “Yep. They’d dug gravel pits all along the shoreline for mining purposes, and Pierce’s guys re-engineered those to set up the hydro plant.” “Oh,” she said. “That’s not all. There’s a gold mine upriver on the Potaro, and there was a stone quarry right at the mouth of the Potaro where it flows into the Essequibo that they filled in around to make the little marina where the Landing is.” “It sounds as if you’ve been here before.” “Yeah,” I said. “This hasn’t been a pristine jungle for decades. Pierce just went ahead and built a town, but all around here there’s industry. I’m not sure Liberty Point isn’t a lot more environmentally sound than the mining operations they’ve had around here for a long time.” “It seems like you aren’t very objective about this place.” “Are you going to interview the people?” I asked. “That is my plan,” Sarah nodded. “Well then let’s do that together. My team and I are recording a documentary starting tomorrow, and that was part of our plan as well.” “Is it dangerous, then?” Brienna, who had just returned, asked. “Tooling around in the bush with the natives?” “Oh, the ones I’ve met are perfectly docile. And quite fond of Pierce, too.” “I’m not sure I believe that,” Sarah said. “Well, you’ll get to see for yourself,” I said. “Brienna, do you want to go and meet the locals with us tomorrow?” I could instantly tell that she did not. “Pierce said something about a waterfall,” she said. “I think I’m for that instead.” Not long after, Burnham pulled me aside. “You guys figure out how to dump your investment in Guyana yet?” I asked him. “Nobody knows this,” he said, “but yesterday the Venezuelans detained a supply ship as it was heading into the offshore complex. They’re now demanding that all supply boats to the rigs have to come out of Venezuela.” “Sounds like a job for the U.S. Navy.” “Damn right it is. Know what the Navy is doing?” “What’s that?” “Watching.” “What?” “You heard me. They’re ‘observing.’ And we’ve had lots of contact with the captain of the frigate which hangs around our complex. He isn’t happy, but his orders are not to intervene.” “I thought the Navy was doing patrol flights over Guyana now. I thought they’d been doing that since December.” “They were. Not anymore. Stopped 10 days ago.” “The hell?” “This shit is about to get out of control, Mike. The Vinnies are coming.” “The Vinnies?” “Yeah. That’s our nickname for the Venezuelans.” I considered that and nodded. It fit. “This is all fun and games here now,” Burnham was saying, “but I’m telling you, get back to Atlanta as fast as you can and stay there.” “That’s your plan? Pull out back to Houston?” “I don’t know what my plan is. I know that you don’t want to be here when the balloon goes up.” Then, as quickly as he’d pigeonholed me, Burnham gave me a smile and disappeared. I mingled for a while with the rest of the swells, and then Pierce collected me for a confab in a well-appointed private room off the salon. There, I saw that Darke and Burnham were sitting at a table with Ishgan and Jaganoo. And an old guy built like a stone statue who had a handshake like a rock-crusher. I found that out when he introduced himself. “Hal Gibson,” he said curtly, as I felt the bones in my right hand come under excruciating strain. “You’re not the Hal Gibson who resigned from USMC over the COVID jab, are you?” I asked. “I think I remember you from Laura Ingraham’s show.” “Yeah, that’s me,” he said. “That was my retirement after 20 years commanding men in battle. A vaccine shot is more important in the service now than competent leadership.” “Hal is now the security coordinator for Liberty Point,” said Pierce. “He has lots of ideas on how to defend this place.” “I assume that includes the Predators I saw in the hangar,” I said. Gibson looked at me. “I hope that won’t make it into your podcast,” he said. “It will not.” He nodded. The meeting in the little side room didn’t last too long, but it was — what’s the word? — declarative. Gibson got into Darke’s face and accused him of being a plant for the Vinnies. Darke hotly contested that and fingered Jaganoo. Things got ugly from there, and then Pierce stepped in and explained to the Guyanese that he was going to defend their country even if they wouldn’t. Ishgan said he was fully committed and that he welcomed whatever help Pierce and Gibson and Sentinel and Exoil were willing to offer. Darke echoed that. All eyes went to Jaganoo. “I don’t understand why I am suspected,” he said. “I’ve only ever attempted cordial relations with our neighbors. It doesn’t make me a traitor.” “We can’t afford traitors,” said Burnham. “And we won’t have them,” said Gibson. Jaganoo shrugged. He was uncomfortable, clearly, but he was slick. He admitted nothing. And yet you got the firm impression there was a lot he could admit. I felt like that was true of Darke as well, but Pierce and Burnham seemed interested in giving him the benefit of the doubt. And Gibson backed off his initial accusations. Darke was strangely unbothered by those. Regardless, the Americans didn’t talk very much about military hardware or strategy with the Guyanese bigwigs there. Which I understood, but it didn’t give me much in the way of a good feeling about the planned defense of Essequibo. Then Sarah found me after it was over. “What are you doing later?” she asked. “Back to the lodge to get together with my crew, then we’ll get dinner,” I said. “Why? Are you trying to get out of playing third wheel to Pierce and your sister?” She nodded. “It’s boring,” she said. “They’re boring.” They were two of the most famous human beings on the planet and she was telling me I was more interesting than them. I had trouble believing that, but then again it was fun to get attention from a beautiful girl again. “Well then, come and join us,” I volunteered. She nodded again."
"1","Germany’s Catholic bishops have abandoned their plans to form a forbidden Synodal Council to replace the authority of bishops with a democratic body of clergy and laity. On the eve of their annual plenary assembly, the German bishops were given a letter from the Vatican reinforcing Rome’s ban on the creation of such a council and warning that, if the bishops approved the council against Pope Francis’ express instructions, Rome would be forced to respond “with the corresponding legal consequences.” The letter — signed by Vatican Secretariat of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF); Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández; and the new prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, Cardinal Robert Prevost and delivered at the behest of Pope Francis — reiterates that the German Bishops’ Conference does not have the legal authority or standing under Catholic Canon Law to establish, govern, or participate in the Synodal Council as it is described. The curia cardinals warned that any decision the German bishops made in favor of the council “would be invalid.” The cardinals further warned that communications with the Vatican may become hostile and would certainly be strained if the German Bishops’ Conference attempted to approve the creation of the Synodal Council. “It should be noted,” the cardinals wrote, “that the issue was already presented during the last Ad Limina visit” to Rome in late 2022, after which the council’s inception was explicitly banned by the Vatican, in a letter approved by the Pontiff himself. The Vatican had agreed last year, as the global Synod on Synodality was concluding, to continue meeting with Germany’s bishops to discuss their vision and craft a plan for the future that is in line with Catholic Canon Law and theology. “If the Statute of the Synodal Committee is adopted before this meeting,” the cardinals wrote, “the question arises as to the meaning of this meeting and, more generally, of the ongoing dialogue process.” The German Bishops’ Conference was slated to vote on whether to approve the Synodal Council’s creation during the conference’s plenary assembly this week but seemingly acquiesced to the Vatican’s orders and removed voting on the council from their agenda. However, Bishop Georg Bätzing, head of the German Bishops’ Conference, lashed out at Rome on Monday for delaying meeting with the German bishops. “We could already be further along,” he said. While this avoids schism in Germany for the moment, the German Bishops’ Conference will meet again this summer and this fall. Depending on how talks go with the Vatican scheduled for June, the Bishops’ Conference may still choose to animate its Frankenstein’s monster of a council."

"1","One figure that liberals haven’t commemorated this Black History Month is Eldridge Cleaver, the Black Panther Party ringleader of the 1960s. The reason is no great mystery: Had Cleaver remained a radical leftist , he would be hailed by the Left to this day. But instead, leftists have gone silent on Cleaver, because of a very uncomfortable reality for them: by the 1980s, Eldridge Cleaver had become a conservative. He had become an intensely anti- communist, Reagan-endorsing Republican who even challenged his pro-Marxist congressman, Ron Dellums, in a run for Congress. Yes, the legendary Eldridge Cleaver had become a black conservative. And there are few types that liberals detest more than black conservatives. (READ MORE from Paul Kengor: My Top 10 Black Conservatives ) Leroy Eldridge Cleaver was born in Wabbaseka, Arkansas on August 31, 1935. His father was a big, strong man who abused his mother, which terribly affected Cleaver. He longed to take vengeance upon his father, to grow up tough enough to “beat him to the ground the way he beat my mother.” And yet, Eldridge himself would become an abuser of women, and more. Cleaver’s family moved to the turbulent Watts section of Los Angeles, a powder keg of racial discontent in the 1960s. Cleaver got sucked in. As a teen, he got into serious trouble. For various crimes, he landed first in juvenile detention centers en route to adult jail at Soledad State Prison. It was there that Cleaver might have been reformed; instead, he started reading Voltaire, Lenin, W.E.B. DuBois, and Karl Marx. Bad choices. At age 23, out of Soledad prison, Cleaver quickly fell back into trouble. He was convicted of rape and assault with intent to murder, which sent him right back to jail. Making things worse, he was further politically radicalized by digging deeper into Marx’s Communist Manifesto . During his time in Folsom State Prison in 1965, Cleaver wrote what became his famous memoir, Soul on Ice , published in 1968. He there candidly admitted his drug use, his raping of women, and his commitment to Marxism. The raping of women was especially appalling, as Cleaver cast it in a political- racial perspective as a form of “insurrectionist” activity against the dominant white power structure. He wrote, disturbingly: I became a rapist. To refine my technique and modus operandi, I started out by practicing on black girls in … the black ghetto where dark and vicious deeds appear not as aberrations or deviations from the norm, but as part of the sufficiency of the Evil of the day—and when I considered myself smooth enough, I crossed the tracks and sought out white prey…. Rape was an insurrectionary act. It delighted me that I was defying and trampling upon the white man’s law, upon his system of values, and that I was defiling his women. Cleaver had been willing to commit murder. He said openly that “there was little doubt” that he “would have slit some white throats” if he knew he could get away with it. Soul on Ice , despite its violent depravity, became a bestseller and a sacred text to the Black Power movement. The ‘60s New Left embraced Cleaver wholeheartedly. It “dug” Cleaver’s revolutionary Marxism. Cleaver joined the Marxist-Leninist Black Panther Party, located in Oakland, California. He became the group’s so-called “Minister of Information,” or spokesman. Like Third World Marxist revolutionaries, Cleaver and his Panthers were committed to armed struggle. They favored an armed overthrow of the U.S. government. In a fascinating 1986 interview with Reason Magazine , when he was no longer seeking to overthrow the U.S. government, and a very different person, Cleaver admitted that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had him and the Black Panther Party pegged, even as Cleaver’s white-leftist allies insisted that Hoover and his boys were paranoid anti-communists: Sure I can understand J. Edgar Hoover, because he wasn’t inaccurate. We were the most militant black organization, and we were serious in what we were going about. He said that we were the main threat. We were trying to be the main threat. We were trying to be the vanguard organization. J. Edgar Hoover was an adversary, but he had good information. We were plugged into all of the revolutionary groups in America, plus those abroad. We were working hand-in-hand with communist parties here and around the world, and he knew that. So from his position, he had to try to stop us. Cleaver explained how he and his comrades would plan ambushes of the so-called “pigs.” When the police responded, Cleaver and comrades tried to blame the cops: We used to lie about it, because the information was a weapon also. We would go out and ambush cops, but if we got caught we would blame it on them and claim innocence. I did that personally in the case I was involved in…. We always did that. The cauldron of this cesspool of violence was the state of California, where, interestingly, the governor was Ronald Reagan. This eventually pitted Eldridge Cleaver against Ronald Reagan. That was not a safe situation for Reagan. Though Cleaver had been charged with attempted murder and ordered back to jail, a liberal judge released him after only two months. And no one was shocked when Free Speech Movement leftists at Cal- Berkeley in 1968 rolled out the red carpet for Cleaver to give a series of “lectures.” Governor Reagan and the California Board of Regents, however, were appalled. Reagan strenuously objected : “If Eldridge Cleaver is allowed to teach our children, they may come home one night and slit our throats.” (READ MORE: The Martin Luther King Jr. That Liberals Hate ) Reagan’s vivid warning was not unwarranted, given that Cleaver had written in Soul on Ice about desiring to slice throats. Cleaver not only expressed feigned outrage at Reagan’s remark but responded with violent warnings, several times challenging Reagan to a duel, publicly declaring, “I’ll beat him to death.” Likewise a target of Cleaver was California’s Superintendent of Public Instruction Max Rafferty. Cleaver ripped into both Reagan and Rafferty in a speech before a large audience of admiring leftists in the football stadium of Sacramento State College on October 2, 1968. To wild applause from “peace activists,” Cleaver barked: Someone told me that when Ronald Reagan entered the capitol here, they changed the name of the Capitol [building] to the Fairy Building. I say that is very appropriate and want to congratulate whoever came up with that thought and I have a special new word for Ronald Reagan this morning, “Fuck you, Ronnie baby!” [loud, sustained, raucous applause] I believe, I believe that Ronald Reagan is a punk, a sissy, and a coward, and I challenge him to a duel. I challenge the punk to a duel to the death that he can choose his own weapons. It could be a baseball bat, a gun, a knife, or marshmallow. I’ll beat him to death with a marshmallow. You know, I lived in this area for a number of years—Folsom Prison is about 20 miles from here…. I know that my parole officer has his comrades here today, agents here. Same thing for Ronald Reagan, same thing for the adult authorities, the same things for all the wards involved in prison, all the pigs, the hogs who patrol the prison— fuck you ! As Cleaver raged on, the liberals loved it, cheering wildly in roaring approval. He referred to public authorities as pigs, racists, and “motherf**kers,” emphasizing that “the term ‘motherf**ker’ is a legitimate term.” He ripped the “bald headed faggots in the legislature,” and on and on. Readers today will observe that Cleaver’s litany of insults ought to be denounced as “homophobic” by liberals. But quite the contrary: leftists love gay-bashers when one of their guys is doing the bashing. For decades, they smeared J. Edgar Hoover as a queer, homosexual, cross-dressing “transvestite.” During this talk in Sacramento, the progressives in the audience chuckled merrily at every slur dished by Cleaver. He was energized by their reaction, carrying on like a vulgar comedian. The good news: Eldridge Cleaver’s parole was revoked. It was clear this was a dangerous man. He was ordered back to prison. The bad news: He had other plans. He was not about to go back to jail. Discovering Dystopia On November 24, 1968, only three days before he was required to turn himself over to authorities, Eldridge Cleaver bolted. He fled America as a fugitive, settling first in Fidel Castro’s Cuba. The Cuban despot, however, was suspicious. He thought that perhaps Cleaver was secretly spying for the U.S. government—a most unlikely possibility, but not an unusual thought for the paranoid tyrant in Havana. Of all places, Cleaver found refuge in another communist dystopia: Kim Il Sung’s North Korea. For a black man struggling for freedom from government oppression, this seemed an odd choice. Not only did North Korea have no freedom, but it also had no black people. And really, everyone in North Korea was in shackles, other than Kim and his party apparatchiks; here was a whole nation of slaves. That was something that Eldridge Cleaver learned right away. In Pyongyang, he was smacked upside the head with some harsh realities. The political pilgrim experienced a huge wake- up call. Cleaver was aghast at the reality on the ground in these communist hellholes. Marxism was not what he imagined it to be. (READ MORE: Potemkins in Pyongyang ) Cleaver learned that fellow leftist intellectuals in the United States glowed about these places without having actually visited them. If they did bother to visit, they received orchestrated tours where guides paraded them through Potemkin villages. But Cleaver was street-smart. He was no fool. He later told Reason Magazine : “See, I lived in those kinds of places and I got to know people.” Cleaver got those Potemkin village tours, but then, “I had a chance to meet other people and have a different experience. If I had gone only on the basis of how the governments treated me , I would have continued praising them, because really they did treat me well. They gave me a red-carpet treatment in those countries. But when you get off the red carpet and step down in the mud where the people are, you get a chance to talk to them and hear the stories that they have to tell, over and over again.” Cleaver was given the useful-idiot treatment, but he was no useful idiot. He later conceded that “to go to a country like Cuba or Algeria or the Soviet Union and see the nature of control that those state apparatuses had over the people—it was shocking to me. I didn’t want to believe it, because it meant that the politics that I was espousing was wrong and was leading toward a very bad situation.” He furthered: “when you look at those governments up close and see how they treat their own people, you can’t believe in that.” Cleaver got out of Pyongyang and put it and other false utopias far behind. By 1975, he was longing to make his way back to America, the country that he once thought was the world’s most oppressive. His real-world experience with communism had made Cleaver a committed anti-communist. He started questioning everything that he had learned from the Left. In choosing to return to America, Cleaver would need to face the justice system yet again. But now, he was willing to do so. As one observer noted , “Facing a murder charge in the United States is, apparently, preferable, and not by a small margin, to being given the red- carpet treatment in the various socialist and communist paradises around the world.” And so, in 1977, Eldridge Cleaver surrendered to the FBI. Somehow, through a plea bargain, he was sentenced to merely 1,200 hours of community service. He must have been grateful for this leniency. In Cuba or North Korea, he would have been cast into a dungeon. In the USSR, Siberia. For Cleaver, these real-life experiences began a religious odyssey as well. Like Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, he had once sought Islam. Now, he turned to Christianity. He became a born-again evangelical before eventually settling on Mormonism, joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in December 1983. Backing Reagan and Running for Congress Eldridge Cleaver’s dramatic conversion soon became public when he announced that he was backing President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 reelection. He informed a shocked America that he had become a conservative Republican and would even seek political office on the GOP ticket. He ran for Congress against Rep. Ron Dellums, the wildly pro-communist Democrat congressman from Berkeley. Cleaver had once so militantly opposed Ronald Reagan that he had been willing to kill him. By the 1980s, he supported Reagan and his policies on issues from anti-communism to strengthening law and order. Cleaver came to see welfare programs as actually hurting the people they were intended to help. He told Reason Magazine in 1986: My life, I think, spans the whole era of the welfare state. I was born in 1935. I remember when people were ashamed to be on welfare and receive state aid and all that, but we developed a situation where black people to a large degree and a lot of other groups such as elderly people, children and a lot of poor white people ended being harnessed by political forces, particularly the Democratic Party. In return for the federal appropriations that we are now dependent upon, our leaders were obligated to get out the black vote for the Democratic Party. So this put us in a negative relationship with the economic system. We were dependent upon the federal budget—a very precarious situation. Black conservatives would refer to this “harnessed” political dependency as the Democratic Party’s “liberal plantation.” When they pointed this out, black and white liberals excoriated them as “Uncle Toms.” Nonetheless, black conservatives like the late Walter Williams, Thomas Sowell, Bob Woodson, Clarence Thomas, Larry Elder, Candace Owens, Ben Carson and on and on have made this point, enraging liberal Democrats. Eldridge Cleaver, a symbol of black empowerment, wanted blacks to empower themselves. (READ MORE: Black and Conservative … and Forgotten ) By this point, Cleaver was not only firmly anti-welfare state, but had become firmly pro-American, ditching all the anti- American Marxist claptrap he had once advocated. When the reporters from Reason Magazine visited Cleaver at his home in Berkeley in 1986, they were struck by the large American flag flying from his front porch. Cleaver went so far as to demand that the berserk Berkeley City Council begin its meetings with the Pledge of Allegiance. This prompted the far-left Berkeley Mayor Gus Newport to snap at Cleaver: “Shut up, Eldridge. Shut up or we’ll have you removed!” So much for the Berkeley Free Speech Movement. But as Cleaver came to understand, the Left was full of hypocrisy. Leftists ran not only the liberal plantation, but cancel culture. Cleaver was very outspoken during this period. He talked about other former Black Panthers who had become conservatives—as well as staunch supporters of the police. He spoke of one incident: “I was pulled over in my car with my secretary for a traffic thing, and one of the officers walked up to the car and saw me sitting inside. He took off his hat and said, ‘Hey, Eldridge, remember me?’ He used to be a Panther.” Eldridge Cleaver would today be appalled at the idiotic, reckless, dangerous calls by groups like Black Lives Matter to defund and even abolish the police , not to mention the support of communism by BLM’s founders Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza. A Soul on Ice Seeks Heaven In all, to say that Eldridge Cleaver lived a difficult life is an understatement. He had been a violent criminal in his youth. Throughout the remainder of his life, he spoke candidly about his sins and crimes. By the 1980s, he had turned his life around. Still, he struggled. Despite seeking out Christianity, he remained long tormented by his demons. He never gave up drug use completely. He went into a rehab center. In 1994, he almost died from a blow to the head by a fellow drug addict. Still, his long struggle brought him closer to peace and contentment. Richard Rose, a professor of religion and philosophy who worked with Cleaver at the University of La Verne (near Los Angeles), watched him up close in his final days. “He was a gentle spirit,” Rose observed . “His presence of nonconformity was still there, and he was his own person.” The lifetime of turmoil took a toll. Cleaver struggled physically, but his belief in a higher power, a Creator, kept him going. At one of his final public appearances, an Earth Day conference in Portland, Oregon, in late April 1998, he affirmed, “I’ve gone beyond civil rights and human rights to creation rights.” It was above all his Creator that he longed for. On May 1, 1998, at 6:20 a.m., Eldridge Cleaver died at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center in suburban Los Angeles. He was 62 years old. Eldridge Cleaver’s long fight was over. The soul on ice endeavored for his soul to enter heaven. That meant leaving the Left far behind. He and his remarkable journey deserve to be remembered. But unfortunately, our liberal media, historians, and culture do not fondly remember black conservatives like Eldridge Cleaver, not during Black History Month or at any time."
"1","Tuesday It’s raining here in glorious L.A. I love sunshine. Hate rain. Puts me in a very bad mood. And frightens me. Back up. I’m a Republican. I have always been a Republican, ever since I learned that the GOP founded the moral and intellectual movement that ended by far the worst fact of the glorious United States of America, and that the GOP founded the most basic glory of the human race: the movement to end human slavery. My father, Herbert Stein and my mother, Mildred Fishman Stein, were Republicans and so were my grandparents on both sides, also to end slavery, and also to end the cruel slavery of alcoholism and drug addiction. My family were Republicans as long as there were Republicans. The GOP has only existed in any meaningful form since the middle of the 19th century. I love the GOP. It has shown great courage on every moral issue in my lifetime. It showed kindness to my parents in the Nixon and Ford days. It showed me great kindness in the months I worked at the White House for Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford as a speechwriter. It saved Israel. Literally saved Israel’s life in the Yom Kippur War — and saved the world from nuclear war. But now, something has happened to the Grand Old Party. We as a party have swerved on the road of history. In recent decades and month and days, the GOP has set out on a frightening path. For one important thing, the Party has blocked life-or-death military and financial aid to Ukraine as it fights one of the most inspiring fights of the century. Vlad Putin has invaded the sovereign state of Ukraine just to prove he could. His troops have done mass murder. They have raped and then buried alive thousands of Ukrainian women and girls until they died horrible deaths. Republicans have declined to sell vital anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine. The result has been that the Russians could do terror bombing to Ukrainian civilians at will. Why? This is all currently being done under the tutelage of Mr. Trump. Why? The bravest resistance to dictatorship shown in my lifetime has been done by the Ukrainians in the recent past. Why? Mr. Trump has always supported liberty-loving people. Why is he stopping now? Why has he turned away from the path blazed by the greatest of Americans, such as Abe Lincoln? Mr. Trump is far from Abraham Lincoln. But he has some greatness clinging to him from his peace-making efforts ending in the Abraham Accords, going some distance towards a generalized peace in the Middle East. That proved a large- scale Middle East peace could possibly happen. There is much more to be said and I will say it very soon. But Mr. Trump was a great President from 2017 to 2021. He was succeeded by a mischief maker. Let’s please see what the genius of the American people can yet dig up. We are not exhausted as a world leader. With the right leader, we are just getting started.

"1","N ate Loewentheil has written a guest essay in the New York Times . He proposes something quite amusing: to build a wall of climate shame. A towering wall on a Washington lot. A marble wall, perhaps. A wall engraved with the names, in giant letters, of those public figures who deny the existence of climate change. The idea is a good one. Hitler would be proud. He intends to pay for it with donations, but I’m sure Nate wouldn’t mind building it on the taxpayers’ dime. When it comes to saving the planet, who cares about money? The best part of the project is that Nate doesn’t propose to hang those he calls “deniers” from the wall by their thumbs. That’s good. It’s important that there be no blood, only public scorn. This is also done by the Islamic state when it hangs sharia non-compliers on crosses at the entrance to the city so that everyone else can insult, spit, and do whatever else those boys do in their practice of the religion of peace. Nate is extremely annoyed that people don’t believe that climate change is the apocalypse and proposes to chastise them. Nate deftly avoids saying that climate change, as such, is denied by almost no one. Climate has always fluctuated, even before Nate discovered it. What most of us deny (and very much so) is that man’s actions have any impact on climate. When we say man, we could say cow too. As you know, the new goal of the climate Left is to ruin livestock and agriculture. And, of course, Nate also hates those of us who don’t think it would do any good to turn the West into the Third World, as leftist green politicians would have us do, while the rest of the planet continues to make money and pollute like there’s no tomorrow. Nate’s proposal brings together everything I abhor about the postmodern Left: the moral superiority, the condescension, the manipulation, the tutelage, the use of state power as a tool of extortion, the stupidity, the apocalyptic tone, and the earnestness. He believes that building a climate wall will put an end to dissidents who still think for themselves. The idea couldn’t be more ridiculous. If you want some advice, Nate, stick that wall on the damn border and inscribe on it the names of the incompetent politicians who have created this immigration chaos. I make a habit out of not doubting the good will behind proposals from Green Progressives. This one is no exception. I am convinced that Nate wants to stop Al Gore’s fake bears from drowning in the ocean. In fact, I’m so confident in his (and the New York Times ’) righteous intentions that I’m not even going to mention that the guy is the founder and managing partner of a venture capital firm focused on clean energy. It is, in short, a minor detail that adds nothing of context to his architectural plans. Translated by Joel Dalmau.

"2","Meet two of the hot speakers at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC): Presidents Nayib Bukele of El Salvador and Javier Milei of Argentina, two of Latin America’s most flamboyant right-wing populists. CPAC started in 1974 as an annual gathering of conservatives; over the years it has turned into a days-long, livestreamed far-right spectacle. Policy is discussed and refined while movement luminaries like former President Donald Trump and House GOP Chair Elise Stefanik are given the opportunity to share their ideas with a receptive audience. It might be a little sleepier than usual this year, but the conference still reveals where American conservatism is headed. And the two Latin American leaders’ presence underscores the right’s continued affinity for populist and even illiberal leadership — particularly when combined with modern personal brands built online . They aren’t the first extremist leaders to speak at CPAC: Viktor Orbán of Hungary and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil have featured in past years. Like Orbán and Bolsonaro, Bukele and Milei are staunch populists who have proposed radical solutions to serious problems in their countries. The American right finds those radical proposals attractive , even if the policies likely couldn’t — or shouldn’t — be instituted in the US. Bukele has, seemingly, mitigated El Salvador’s serious gang violence problem through mass arrests and incarceration, while Milei’s economic policies are supposed to right Argentina’s inflation-plagued economy. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has praised both men; though he has yet to meet Milei, the former president enjoyed a friendly relationship with Bukele. Other conservative figures, including Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) of the Freedom Caucus, have praised Milei’s push for “limited” government . The two leaders are important voices at CPAC as conservatives work to draw in Latin American voters before the election in November; Bukele in particular is popular among Salvadorans living in the US. But their presence at the conference is about more than trying to win votes, Erica Frantz, a professor of political science at Michigan State University, told Vox — it’s about creating a particular type of international far-right ideology. “Linking Milei and Bukele with the Trump movement is advantageous for all parties involved,” she said. “For Milei and Bukele, it gives them the opportunity to strengthen an alliance with the potential presidential candidate most likely to be sympathetic to their authoritarian ambitions.” For Trump and his supporters, “it is a chance to send a message to supporters that its style of politics is gaining steam outside US borders.” Bukele and Milei were elected to tackle big issues Bukele has had a long relationship with the pro-Trump right since his first presidential election in 2019. That relationship started online, among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The ideology underlying cryptocurrency is decidedly libertarian, with many adherents calling for the abolition of treasuries and central banks. Bukele’s profile rose when El Salvador began accepting bitcoin as legal tender, and he’s remained popular despite the damage it’s done to the country’s economy following the cryptocurrency crash of 2022. But the leader’s crypto fixation — which is affecting the country’s ability to secure international financing — is almost quaint in the face of his authoritarian turn, ostensibly to address the country’s serious crime problem. Gangs controlled most aspects of life in the country, which was once known for having the highest murder rate in the world . With a campaign of mass arrests, Bukele has indeed tackled El Salvador’s crime problem. But that has come at a steep cost, as I explained last year : Successive presidential administrations have taken different approaches — many have adopted the mano dura , or “iron hand” tack, instituting harsh crackdowns to mitigate the violence. But Bukele is on an entirely different level; his administration has imprisoned tens of thousands, many arbitrarily , repeatedly extended a state of emergency severely curtailing the rights of ordinary citizens, and attacked and even detained his critics in the press. The country now instead boasts the highest incarceration rate in the world. Despite the human rights violations, Bukele’s policies have been popular in El Salvador. Given the astounding level of violence that ordinary people have suffered under the gangs’ power — and the rapidity with which the violence decreased — it’s not ultimately that surprising that Bukele won a second term in office, despite the fact that he has dismantled parts of El Salvador’s democracy, manipulating institutions from the country’s Constitutional Court to its legislature , to do so. Though the policy appears to be working in the immediate term, critics argue it isn’t sustainable for two major reasons. The first is that Bukele has made no effort to build a long-term social or economic infrastructure as an alternative to gang violence. The second is that the sense of security people currently feel requires sacrificing other forms of security, such as the rule of law. “[Bukele’s] popularity is built on illegality and undemocratic actions,” Noah Bullock, the executive director of the human rights organization Cristosal, told Vox. “There is no historic precedent where the use of state violence has produced lasting peace.” That didn’t stop Bukele from suggesting the US ought to learn from his policies during his CPAC speech on Thursday. “We can clearly see the signs of a declining society because our own hit rock bottom decades ago,” he told the cheering audience. He urged Americans to look at “big cities in decline like Baltimore, Portland, New York, just to name a few places where crime and drugs have become the daily norm.” Milei has only been in office for a couple of months, so he’s had less time to implement his libertarian economic policies. And he might not be able to do that much; already in his brief tenure, the congress voted down his party’s omnibus bill , which included fiscal measures aimed at managing inflation as well as an attempt to secure emergency legislative powers for, potentially, his entire four-year term. Along with deregulation and privatization efforts, the omnibus bill hinted at Milei’s social agenda: It would have reduced prenatal parental leave for women and slashed environmental protections in favor of business interests. Milei will speak at the conference Saturday, most likely about his efforts to privatize state enterprises and cut down on regulations — both topics with great appeal to CPAC’s audience. US conservatives benefit from Bukele and Milei’s illiberal policies Bukele and Milei were each granted a mandate by presenting extreme solutions to serious problems in their countries that have long frustrated citizens. But they have clear ideologies and proclivities toward illiberalism that emerge within those contexts, too. “They are able to articulate a real problem in society and propose solutions,” Daniel Rothschild, executive director of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told Vox. When people are truly struggling, they respond to those policies, “even if they are illiberal.” In his speech on Thursday evening, Bukele warned that the US was headed for the same kind of violent, gang- plagued system that defined El Salvador. But he, like Trump and other conservatives, exaggerates the problem the US faces. Trump and his allies have argued that cities (especially those in Democratic-controlled states) are full of violence, and they have also made a bogeyman out of the gang Mara Salvatrucha, or MS13, which has terrorized El Salvador along with Barrio 18. It is true that MS13 actually started in the US and has had a presence here. It is also true that violent crime, including homicide, increased during the social upheaval of the pandemic, and that certain kinds of property crimes have increased. But violent crime is now at pre-pandemic levels and has trended downward overall since the 1990s. In other words, there’s simply no parallel to the violence and terror wrought by gang violence in El Salvador. It’s not hard to see why Trump and others at CPAC would want to champion someone like Bukele. He exemplifies “tough on crime” rhetoric and, to their minds, proves that the only way to avoid the “American carnage” Trump warned of in his 2017 inauguration speech is to restrict human and civil rights and undo democratic norms and institutions. Milei, despite having struggled to pass his policies, similarly embodies conservative ideals. His efforts to curb government spending and significantly reduce the size of the government echo the Republican party’s rhetoric of limited government and tighter belts — but the US isn’t dealing with 140 percent inflation or a 57 percent poverty rate . It’s still early in Milei’s tenure, but it is important to note that he and Bukele — like Trump — exemplifies what Frantz and others call a “personalist” leader. “The party that supports them is intricately linked to their persona rather than a clear policy platform,” Frantz explained. Social media is an important tool in the personalist leader’s playbook that Milei, Bukele, and Trump have all used to their advantage — they don’t have to go through establishment channels that might soften their policies or their rhetoric. That social media following has created a wave of “millennial authoritarianism,” as researcher Manuel Meléndez-Sánchez termed the phenomenon , which brands these leaders as iconoclasts who reject the “establishment.” “With personalist parties,” Frantz said, “leaders pretty much have a free rein to behave as they please, and — particularly when their party gains majority legislative representation — the door is wide open for democracy to deteriorate.” Even if Milei is struggling to pass his policies in Argentina, he’s still able to paint himself as a warrior in the fight against socialism, as he apparently will do in his CPAC speech. That will solidify his ideological link to US conservatives and show “a very clear picture” of how far-right politicians “learn from each other, how they are connected with each other, and they are sharing an agenda that, far from being local, is a global network,” Paula Avila-Guillen, a human rights lawyer and executive director of the Women’s Equality Center, told Vox. Ultimately, US conservatives like Bukele and Milei because they are hardliners who are using extreme tactics to deal with society’s problems — and are willing to thumb their noses at institutions to get there. As Frantz told Vox, their presence at CPAC is “an effort to cue the conservative base to see authoritarian rhetoric as ‘normal’ and strongman rule as the only solution to society’s problems.” In other words, the message is that not only is there nothing to fear from Trump’s more anti-democratic tendencies , but there’s much to gain from them.

"2","Tonight, South Carolina will hold its Republican presidential primary , in which Donald Trump is all but certain to crush rival Nikki Haley in her home state. Ordinarily, this might feel like big news, as the Palmetto State tends to host one of the most important early contests. Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in the state, after dismal finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, is one of the biggest reasons he’s president today. But the coming vote feels irrelevant: The 2024 Republican primary isn’t and never has been a competitive primary . Trump simply wasn’t going to lose a contest for the hearts and minds of the Republican base. Ideologically , psychologically , even spiritually — it’s the Trump party through and through. I and others have been arguing this for years now . Yet during those same years, many prominent people in politics and the media deluded themselves into thinking he might be dethroned. They have been wrong every time and continued to be wrong long after the strength of Trump’s grip on the GOP could not be denied. There’s a lesson to be learned from this track record of failure, one deeper than just “Republicans really like Donald Trump.” Trump’s persistence tells us something critical about the nature of the current Republican party — and why it’s become such a danger to American democracy . How Trump keeps wiggling his way out of jams Ever since the early stages of the 2016 GOP primary, the same pattern has repeated itself over and over again: Some new development that looked politically dangerous for Trump ends up not mattering at all. This happened so many times in the 2016 election cycle alone that it became a running joke during the campaign. @BronzeHammer The pattern continued through Trump’s presidency, and most strikingly after January 6 — when Trump managed to maintain majority support in the Republican party after inciting an honest-to-god insurrection. At that point, you’d think it would be obvious that Trump was going to cruise to renomination in 2024. Yet somehow, the delusions of a Trump collapse persisted. During the January 6 Committee meetings in summer 2022, there was widespread speculation that the dramatic public hearings had weakened Trump’s hold on the GOP . Republican primary voters proceeded to disprove this theory by booting the House members who voted for his impeachment and nominating full-MAGA election deniers, like Arizona’s Kari Lake, to contest key swing races around the country. These candidates performed poorly in the 2022 midterms , while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis cruised to reelection. This led many observers to see DeSantis as a possible Trump killer, with some going so far as to anoint DeSantis the frontrunner in early 2023 . Soon after that, DeSantis’s poll numbers collapsed . After the DeSantis train crashed, Trump skeptics crowned Haley the next anti-Trump Republican hope . She secured critical funding from Americans for Prosperity Action , the political arm of the Koch empire, in November — raising the Haley hype to surprising heights going into 2024. In mid-January, prominent pundit Jonathan Rauch gave Haley roughly a 40 percent chance to win the primary, adding that “the odds might shift in her favor quickly.” Then she lost by double-digits in her supposed stronghold of New Hampshire, and the writing was on the wall in great big bold letters. None of this speculation tracked Trump’s poll numbers. The former president consistently led in the polling averages , generally by wide margins. So why did so many get this so wrong? Sometimes, the explanation is mundane wishcasting: centrist or anti- Trump Republicans desperately wishing to avoid a choice between a threat to democracy and a Democrat. But in some cases, there’s a more interesting explanation — that even some of the GOP’s critics didn’t fully appreciate what it had become. New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait, one of the more perceptive of these critics, was an early booster of DeSantis’s chances. In August of last year, he admitted that he had gotten it wrong — and wrote an interesting column trying to explain why he erred. Chait’s basic argument is that Trump’s cult of personality was far more powerful than he had appreciated. “Defeating Trump in a contest determining who can most effectively advance ideological or party goals is difficult but attainable. It is obviously impossible to defeat Trump in a contest of who is most loyal to Trump,” Chait concluded. This is surely a key part of the story. But it also raises a more fundamental question that Chait doesn’t attempt to answer: Why does the Republican base have such unwavering faith in the man? Trump’s celebrity charisma alone isn’t enough of an explanation. Otherwise, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger would bestride the GOP like a colossus. Nor is Trump’s fawning coverage in the conservative media. Fox News has repeatedly tried to turn the Republican base away from Trump and toward figures like DeSantis, only to have to kiss the ring when the voters didn’t follow their lead. The answer, at least as far as I can tell, is that Trump’s cult is the product of his unique ability to channel the cultural grievances at the heart of the current Republican party. Again and again , social scientists found that the best predictor of Trump support among Republican voters is the degree to which they feel discomfort with the changing nature of American demographics and social norms. Trump has sold himself as the only person capable of fighting back against the alleged elite conspiracy behind these changes, saying things like “I alone can fix it” and “ I am your retribution .” From these building blocks, he has created a full-scale political movement dedicated to reconquering America. The crowd as former President Donald Trump arrives at a rally on February 17, 2024, in Waterford, Michigan. Scott Olson/Getty Images Trump’s appeal isn’t premised on delivering concrete policy goals, nor even “owning the libs” with high-profile stunts. It is about assuaging the sense of fear and resentment at their America being replaced: about achieving victories that assuage the sense of psychological assault created by things like mass immigration, a Black president, shifting gender roles, and a beloved beer brand cutting an ad with a trans influencer . Donald Trump, as a figure, represents the America they know and love. His victories are their victories, his defeats their defeats. This frame helps us understand why Trump can’t be beaten inside Republican politics. It also clarifies why Trump has been able to steer the Republican party so harshly against democracy. By making his very person into a stand-in for the existential struggle for America’s soul, he has created a world where any loss represents an intolerable blow against everything good about the country. Such a setback can only come from a place of deep corruption — from the Swamp and “Democrat-controlled cities.” And if American democracy has truly been subverted this thoroughly, the logical conclusion is clear: We have to “ fight like hell ” to save it. The South Carolina primary’s irrelevance points to this deeper and darker story. It is one we must wrestle with in order to truly appreciate the stakes in the coming general election.

"2","We had many superstitions when I was a kid. Wear your pajamas inside out. Or wear your underwear on the outside of your PJs. Gargle a bit of saltwater right before bed. When you put your shoes away, make sure they’re backward; left shoe on the right-hand side, right on the left. Our teachers would remind us of these tricks during the school day before a potential snowfall. That night, we would all do our part, hoping and praying that we’d awaken to a sheet of fresh snow, deep enough to render our schools closed for the day. On those mornings, we’d wake up earlier than usual to stare at the local news channel, filled with anticipation as the names of all the local school districts drifted across the screen, anxious to see our own listed among the lucky ones. If a snow day was announced, it was pure elation as we rushed to get our winter bibs and boots on to go out and play in the fresh snow, joining our friends and neighbors for sledding or snowballing or snowman building. We’d return home after a few hours for hot chocolate and soup before putting on dry clothes and heading back out again. Growing up on the Jersey Shore, we rarely had to endure very snowy winters. But each year, we could count on at least one or two snow days minimum. Sometimes, like the great blizzard of ’96 — which, at one point, rendered the whole of the New Jersey Turnpike closed — we’d get entire stretches of days off to play in our sudden winter wonderland. Of course, back then we didn’t have access to the internet like we do now. We couldn’t be in class from the comfort of home. With the proliferation of virtual learning, do kids even get to enjoy the magic of an unexpected snow day anymore? Are true snow days an endangered species? Earlier this month, nearly 1 million students in New York City’s public school system learned that their schools would remain open , despite the threat of a predicted half-foot of snowfall (in the end, estimates ended up being a bit high, with John F. Kennedy International Airport reporting just over 4 inches of accumulation). Classes would be held virtually, they were told — even though there was a network outage that prevented smooth proceedings. There was plenty of pushback, even including some reports of teachers telling parents to ignore the edict from Mayor Eric Adams. But the point remained: Access to virtual learning was robbing kids of one of the premier highlights of youth (at least in those geographical sweet spots like New Jersey, where snow falls sometimes in the winter). Adams’s comments that New York City had to “ minimize how many days our children are just sitting at home making snowmen ,” completely disregarded the social needs of a generation of overworked and overstressed children. Because there’s nothing wrong with a day or two spent sitting at home, making snowmen. At least not according to Melanie Killen , a professor of human development and quantitative methodology at the University of Maryland. “Snow days need to be sledding days,” she said. Snow days offer “a different kind of learning ... an important kind of learning.” I spoke with Killen a few days after those inches of snow blanketed New York City, wondering what effect the growing loss of snow days has on school-aged children. I suggested snow days offer students something of a brain break from the regular grind of school-based learning. Killen was quick to correct me. Are true snow days an endangered species? “I wouldn’t necessarily call it a ‘brain break,’” Killen said. “Kids are out there using their brains in different ways on snow days. It’s a break from the traditional teacher- children dissemination, which kids need.” Killen likened the typical snow day of the past to something like an extended recess, highlighting how during that less structured playtime, kids continue to learn. She added that almost everything about playing in the snow offers some sort of quantifiable lesson about the world. Killen described how throwing snowballs was like a lesson in physics, how sledding involved implicit mathematics, and how even the very snow itself provided children with a sense of material understanding. After all, anyone who’s ever played in the stuff knows exactly what kind of snow makes the best snowballs. These more free-form social settings also allow children to learn how to interact with other people in the world, how to infer intentions and expectations, and how to learn about fairness, morality, and justice. This is known as social cognition , which, according to the American Psychological Association, is the way “people perceive, think about, interpret, categorize, and judge their own social behaviors and those of others.” According to Killen, free-form interactions, like those on a snow day, are prime real estate for the development of social cognition in children. Going virtual on snowy days “undermines the power of peer interactions, which are fundamental for contributing to change and development,” Killen said. To contest Adams’s point: When children are making snowmen, they are absolutely learning. Where I live now in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Andy Jenks is the name people anticipate hearing on a snowy weekday morning. As the chief communications officer for Chapel Hill/Carrboro City Schools, Jenks is the guy on the prerecorded voice message telling us whether or not our schools are closed for the day when snow falls or ice accumulates. Jenks has become such a legend among the local high school kids that homemade signs sporting Jenks’s face were held high above the student section at the recent Chapel Hill/East Chapel Hill rivalry basketball game. Almost everything about playing in the snow offers some sort of quantifiable lesson about the world But while Jenks may get all the praise (or disdain, depending on the nature of the voicemail), the decision on whether or not to close schools is not his. Rather, it’s a decision made by the school system’s superintendent after being informed by what Jenks calls the system’s “operations team.” After observing weather reports and taking a look out the window on a snowy morning, that team makes a suggestion to the superintendent, who then has the final call as to whether or not schools will be closed for that day. Some version of this is standard protocol for most school districts in America. “Generally speaking, it comes down to safety,” Jenks said. “If we believe we can safely transport kids to school and if our staff can safely transport themselves to school ... then we can have school. But if things call safety into question — an accumulation of snow or ice, wind, or other factors — at that point ... [we might] close school altogether.” Jenks also points to local and regional infrastructure as a pivotal factor in the decisions to keep schools open or closed. And while everyone loves to dunk on how the South handles snow, it’s important to remember that places like ours simply aren’t armed with fleets of plows and salt trucks. It can sometimes take days to clear every road in town. Considering as much, if a small portion of the student body lives on roads that can’t be plowed, the whole of the student body gets a snow day. “No one is going to get left behind on account of the weather,” Jenks said. There’s also the question of what’s become known as the digital divide : the socioeconomic gap between those who have reliable access to computers and the internet and those who don’t. For a relatively wealthy school district like Chapel Hill/Carrboro, where each middle and high school student gets a school- issued laptop, it’s less of an issue. Some studies have estimated that as many as 12 million kids across America lack sufficient access to reliable internet access. Some school districts, like Chapel Hill/Carrboro, have taken to sending some students home with wifi hotspots when extended closures are forecast. One district in Wisconsin has even experimented with using drones to deliver connectivity. In many ways, it’s simply easier for the district to cancel school on a snowy day. Sadly, the students of Chapel Hill/Carrboro City Schools haven’t heard Andy Jenks’s prerecorded voice telling them they have a sudden day off due to snow in some time. It’s been 764 days at the time of this writing. It’s a number Jenks hopes will soon reset to zero. “All of us used to be kids and we do appreciate the enjoyment of a good old-fashioned snow day on a fresh winter morning,” he said. “We still believe that kids should have that experience.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","The Supreme Court appears inclined to reinstate Texas and Florida laws seizing control of much of the internet — both of which are currently blocked by court orders — because those laws are incompetently drafted. If that outcome sounds confusing, don’t worry, it is. Monday’s oral arguments in Moody v. NetChoice and NetChoice v. Paxton were messy and often difficult to follow. And the ultimate outcome in these cases is likely to turn on distinctions that even the lawyers found it difficult to keep track of. Before we dig into any of that, however, it’s useful to understand what these cases are actually about. Texas and Florida’s Republican legislatures both passed similar, but not identical, laws that would effectively seize control of content moderation at the “big three” social media platforms: Facebook , YouTube , and Twitter (the platform that Elon Musk insists on calling “X”). These laws’ advocates are quite proud of the fact that they were enacted to prevent moderation of conservative speech online, even if the big three platforms deem some of that content (such as insurrectionist or anti-vax content) offensive or harmful. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said his state’s law exists to fight supposedly “biased silencing” of “ our freedom of speech as conservatives ... by the ‘big tech’ oligarchs in Silicon Valley .” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said his state’s law targets a “dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas .” At least five justices — Chief Justice John Roberts, plus Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett — all seemed to agree that the First Amendment does not permit this kind of government takeover of social media moderation. There is a long line of Supreme Court cases, stretching back at least as far as Miami Herald v. Tornillo (1974), holding that the government may not force newspapers and the like to publish content they do not wish to publish. And these five justices appeared to believe that cases like Tornillo should also apply to social media companies. Indeed, some of them seemed so appalled by Florida’s and Texas’s attempts to control speech online that, at times, they seemed to mock the lawyers defending those states’ laws. As Roberts asked Henry Whitaker, Florida’s solicitor general, “is there any aspect of social media that you think is protected by the First Amendment?” But here’s the rub: The plaintiff challenging these laws, an industry group that represents online companies, brought what is known as a “facial” challenge to the Texas and Florida laws. That means that they seek a court order declaring that both laws essentially must be wiped from the books and cannot ever be applied to anyone — as opposed to a more mild “as-applied” challenge, which would only prevent the law from being applied to certain parties under certain circumstances. Ordinarily, a plaintiff bringing a facial challenge “must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid” (although the rules are somewhat more plaintiff-friendly in First Amendment cases). And, while a majority of the Court appeared to agree Texas and Florida’s attempt to control YouTube or Twitter’s content moderation is unconstitutional, the two states’ laws are so broad that they may also impose obligations on other companies, such as Uber , Etsy, or Gmail, that are not unconstitutional. And so the Supreme Court appears likely to reinstate the Texas and Florida laws. This is not because the Court thinks they are constitutional, and not because the Court thinks that they are constitutional with respect to the three companies that Texas and Florida actually wanted to regulate. But the ham- handedly drafted laws at issue in the NetChoice cases sweep so broadly that they may have some ancillary effects that are permitted by the First Amendment. That’s probably the right outcome under existing law, but good Lord, it’s an unsatisfying one. This litigation has been ongoing for a very long time, and the Texas law already reached the Supreme Court once in 2022, when a majority of the Court voted to temporarily block it . A decision reinstating the laws because they are not vulnerable to a facial challenge would start that process all over again. And it would create at least some risk that, should the personnel of the Court change while this case is being relitigated, that these clearly unconstitutional laws could actually be upheld. What a mess. The case is likely to turn on two very technical distinctions The Court appears likely to rely on the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges to reinstate the two state laws, at least temporarily. The Court’s decision also appears likely to turn on a difference between how the First Amendment governs different kinds of media companies. Historically, the law drew a distinction between two kinds of communications providers . Providers like the Post Office or a telephone company, which make no effort to control the content of anything said by their customers, fell into one category. And the government ordinarily has fairly broad authority to make sure that these companies do not discriminate among their users. The other category includes magazines, newspapers, and other companies that produce curated content. The Tornillo decision held that a news outlet’s “choice of material to go into a newspaper” is subject only to the paper’s “editorial control and judgment,” and that “it has yet to be demonstrated how governmental regulation of this crucial process can be exercised consistent with First Amendment guarantees of a free press.” Social media exists in somewhat of a gray area between a telephone company and a magazine. Like a phone company, social media platforms ordinarily allow nearly anyone to use their service and to say what they want to say using that service. But, like a magazine, they do exclude some content they fear will turn off other users or discourage advertisers from buying ads on their site . That said, there is a very strong argument that social media is enough like a magazine to prevent the Florida and Texas laws from taking effect — both of which seek to prohibit social media sites from pulling down content or banning users because of the viewpoint expressed by that user. (Texas’s law explicitly bans “viewpoint” discrimination by the big three social media companies. Florida’s law is more ambiguous, but appears to do the same.) Again, the purpose of these laws, as DeSantis and Abbott have both said, is to elevate conservative voices who were perceived by Republicans as being unfairly censored online. But, as Kavanaugh pointed out at oral argument, the Supreme Court has long treated laws with skepticism when they seek to “ enhance the relative voice ” of a group that the government wishes to elevate. Yet, while most of the Court appeared to agree that the government cannot take control of social media moderation simply because it wants more insurrectionists or anti-vaxxers to have their tweets prominently featured, a big problem arose as the justices started examining the broad scope of these laws. The Florida law, in particular, is written broadly enough that it may also prohibit services like Gmail from moderating what users put in their emails (setting aside the question of whether Gmail has actually ever done such a thing). And an email provider, unlike a social media provider, closely resembles a telephone company or the Post Office. Unlike a newspaper or a magazine, it does not curate content. So it cannot claim the protection of Tornillo . Indeed, sorting out when the Texas and Florida laws are constitutional and when they are not may be even more complicated than distinguishing between YouTube and Gmail. Facebook, for example, offers a direct message service that allows its users to message each other directly as if they were sending them an email. So even though Tornillo prohibits the government from regulating what appears on any individual user’s “news feed” — the algorithmically curated feed of content that’s Facebook’s central product — a law prohibiting Facebook from engaging in “viewpoint discrimination” in its users’ direct messages would probably be constitutional. Worse, there may be other services provided by these companies that the justices aren’t even aware of — and thus they have no way of knowing whether those services are protected by the First Amendment or not. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put it, “we’re not clear exactly how these platforms work.” And so the Court will probably be forced to send the case back down to lower courts to sort out these uncertainties. The only winner in the NetChoice cases is likely to be NetChoice’s lawyers If the Supreme Court does send the case back down to the lower court, that’s great news for lawyers charging NetChoice an hourly rate. It’s pretty terrible news for everyone else, however. For starters, such a decision would not be a particularly large victory for Texas and Florida. Again, a majority of the Court seemed to agree that the core function of the law — a government takeover of social media moderation — is unconstitutional. To the extent that the law has constitutional applications, they seem to involve curing problems that don’t actually exist, such as Gmail censoring individual emails. If the Court allows the laws to take effect, moreover, it’s not clear that the social media companies can comply with them — and complying with them would make their products vastly worse. Paul Clement, NetChoice’s lawyer, suggested at one point that the big three companies may simply prevent anyone in Texas or Florida from using their services altogether (although there is some doubt over whether Texas’s law allows them to pull out of the state). Alternatively, he suggested that they might have to engage in mass censorship. As Clement pointed out at one point, a ban on “viewpoint discrimination” online means that, if a platform wants to host “suicide prevention” content, it must also host “suicide promotion” content. If it publishes content that portrays Jewish people in a favorable light, it must also host antisemitic content. Rather than turning their platforms over to pro-suicide Nazis, Clement suggested that the major platforms would simply prohibit all discussion whatsoever of suicide or Jewishness. Indeed, several of the justices appeared so bothered by the implications of allowing these laws to take full effect, even temporarily, that they spent much of the argument casting about for ways to prevent that from happening. Barrett, for example, floated the possibility that the Court could write an opinion which states explicitly that many of the law’s applications are unconstitutional, before sending the case back down to the lower court to do the hard work of identifying when the law can stand and when it must fall. Whatever happens, it’s likely to be messy. And, if Monday’s oral argument is any indication, no one who doesn’t get paid by the hour to represent NetChoice in court is likely to be happy with the outcome. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Mark your calendars: February 29 is on . Yes, 2024 is a leap year, which is usually momentous, and not just for the people born on February 29 who only get to celebrate their actual birthdate every four years. Leap years also typically coincide with the US presidential election and the Summer Olympic Games . This year, people in the US will also get to see a rare total solar eclipse darken the skies. To top it off, the sun is also nearing the peak of its 11-year magnetic cycle , upping the potential for solar storms. It makes sense that such a jam-packed year should get an extra day. The simple explanation for why we have leap days is that it takes 365.2422 days for our planet to complete one revolution around the sun. That means each typical 365-day year ends a quarter-day’s worth short of the complete orbit. The following animation from planetary scientist James O’Donoghue visualizes the discrepancy by showing what would happen without leap years. We can’t add quarter days to each year, and the Earth simply cannot spin any faster to make up for the lag, so a leap day is added every four years, with a few exceptions (more on that below). O’Donoghue’s visualization makes it clear how, if we abolished leap years right now, sometime in the 2400s, January would drift into summertime for the Northern Hemisphere. And that would just be confusing! This is why we have Leap Years pic.twitter.com/bCX31kymMW — Dr James O'Donoghue (@physicsJ) February 6, 2020 Humans have been accounting for this discrepancy between Earth’s orbit and the length of a day for a while now — as far back as the ancient Egyptians . The current leap day tradition can be traced back to Pope Gregory in the 1500s , who corrected an earlier attempt at a leap year calendar implemented by Julius Caesar . It’s not the strict case that a leap year happens every four years. You might have noticed that a full orbit around the sun takes 365.2422 days, and not a neat 365.25 days. So if we were to have leap years every four years, then the calendar would still get out of whack over long periods of time. This happened with Julius Caesar’s calendar, which included a leap year every four years. It appeared to work well for a few centuries , and then the seasons started to be misaligned with the calendar dates. And so on Pope Gregory’s updated calendar, there are clever, rare exceptions to the leap year rules. As National Geographic explains : Leap years divisible by 100, like the year 1900, are skipped unless they’re also divisible by 400, like the year 2000, in which case they’re observed. Nobody alive remembers the last lost leap day, but dropping those three leap days every 400 years keeps the calendar on time. The next skipped leap year will be in 2100. If you’re around to celebrate it, congrats. I hope the world still works for you. (The previous skipped leap year was way back in 1900. The one after 2100 will be in 2200.) Can we make a calendar without a leap day? There’s no getting around having to add days to the current calendar. But that doesn’t mean the current calendar is the only possible one. During the last leap year, two professors at Johns Hopkins University (an economist and a physicist) suggested we switch over to a calendar that doesn’t include a leap day and is more consistent year over year (meaning February 2 will always be a Tuesday, no matter what). To make this work, the professors add a whole leap week every fifth or sixth year. It’s effectively creating a new week-long month that pops up only once a decade. Is this better? I don’t know. It depends if we can make the leap week a company holiday. There are merits to our current, chaotic calendar. Over time, you get to have a birthday on every day of the week. In the alternative calendar mentioned above, your birthday will always be on a Tuesday if you're born on a Tuesday. Similarly, isn’t there a joy in learning that Christmas is going to fall on a Monday and that means the holiday has been turned into a three-day weekend? For now, our calendar remains. And because of it, you have an extra day this year! Make the most of it. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","On the same day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a law banning nearly all abortions in South Dakota took effect. This so-called trigger law was passed by South Dakota lawmakers in 2005 and immediately became one of the strictest bans in the nation, with no exceptions even for rape or incest. Now a South Dakota ballot measure to “ restore Roe v. Wade ” is moving forward, despite opposition not just from Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocacy groups, but also from some local reproductive rights activists and national progressive organizations who say it doesn’t go far enough. The pushback from certain corners of the political left illustrates ideological and strategic fissures within the abortion rights movement that have intensified since the fall of Roe , and leave ballot measure organizers in South Dakota to push ahead alone. The proposed measure would amend South Dakota’s constitution to effectively codify the access available under the original Roe v. Wade decision. It would prevent the state from regulating abortion in the first trimester (weeks 1 to 13 of pregnancy); during the second trimester (14 to 26 weeks) the state could regulate it “only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman.” Beyond that point, after a fetus is viable, South Dakota could regulate or prohibit abortion, except when a doctor deems the procedure necessary to preserve their patient’s “life and health.” The vast majority of abortions in the United States occur during the first trimester. In 2020, 93 percent occurred before 13 weeks, according to the CDC , with an additional 6 percent occurring between 14 and 20 weeks. Though South Dakota is a solidly conservative state, voters have rejected near-total abortion bans on ballot measures twice before — in 2006 and 2008 — and in the last decade, activists have won progressive voter referendums on other issues, including campaign finance , payday lending , medical and recreational cannabis , and most recently, Medicaid expansion . To get on the November ballot, organizers will need to submit at least 35,017 valid petition signatures by May 7. Signatures are being collected by a grassroots group — Dakotans for Health — which also helped lead the ballot measure campaign for Medicaid expansion in 2022. “We’re on track and feeling very bullish,” Adam Weiland, a leader with Dakotans for Health, told Vox. “We’ve got well over 50,000 signatures signed, sealed, and delivered, but we’re still collecting because we know they’re going to throw the kitchen sink at us.” Activists collecting signatures for South Dakota ballot measures. Courtesy of Dakotans for Health Despite the optimism, advocates face hurdles from the left and right. In the Republican-dominated state legislature, more than 90 state senators voted for a resolution opposing the constitutional amendment, and last week House lawmakers voted to allow people to remove their signatures from the ballot-measure petition. (Dakotans for Health has threatened to sue over this.) The prime sponsor of the signature withdrawal bill has been insisting the proposed amendment is far more extreme than Roe v. Wade . Meanwhile on the left, some abortion rights groups have started openly attacking the ballot measure and the organizers behind it. The ACLU of South Dakota, and Planned Parenthood North Central States — which represents Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota —have both raised issues with its drafting and its final language, saying they do not believe it will “adequately reinstate” the right to abortion. Amy Kelley, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Sioux Falls, is supporting the ballot measure because she said practicing health care is untenable for physicians like her under the trigger ban, and she doesn’t want perfect to be the enemy of good. “Of course it would be better to have a bill like the one that died in committee that said abortion is health care and should be left to women and doctors, but are we going to get to that in South Dakota before we have a maternal mortality crisis? Probably not,” Kelley told Vox. “The measure is not enough but does that mean that we don’t go in the right direction just because it’s not exactly what we want?” Who is allowed to lead the defense of reproductive choice? When the draft opinion of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision was leaked in May 2022, Cathy Piersol, a retired Sioux Falls attorney and a longtime advocate for women’s rights, called her friend Jan Nicolay, a former Republican lawmaker who led the campaigns against the 2006 and 2008 abortion ban ballot measures. They knew the trigger ban would take effect if Roe was officially overturned. The women started convening meetings, including with representatives from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. Piersol and Nicolay wanted to submit ballot language to codify abortion rights in South Dakota’s constitution, quickly, before South Dakotans elected a new secretary of state in November 2022. The favored candidate for secretary of state had repeatedly refused to affirm the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s election win in 2020 and was proudly touting an endorsement from South Dakota Right to Life. But some activists felt things were moving too fast and that leaders should conduct more research and polling before advancing any specific ballot measure draft. Given the high likelihood that they’d face legal challenge, these advocates felt more due diligence was needed. Others involved disagreed. They pointed to the prior ballot measure successes led by the South Dakota Campaign for Healthy Families , which Nicolay had directed. “The idea that this was a rushed job is just silly; it’s simply not accurate,” Piersol told Vox. “We knew if we didn’t get a constitutional amendment quickly then the legislature would fiddle, diddle, and mess up the entire thing.” Piersol said she asked a Planned Parenthood regional vice president if there was a plan, “and he said, ‘Well, no, not right now,’ and I knew then we were on our own. It’s daunting but you cannot let yourself be dragged by the nay-sayers.” Nicolay and Piersol approached Dakotans for Health with questions about executing a ballot measure campaign, and the group offered to organize the effort. Rick Weiland, founder of Dakotans for Health and a longtime political operative in the state, said he personally called the local ACLU and Planned Parenthood affiliates multiple times and was ignored. “[We’re] hoping that once we qualify for the ballot there will be a change of heart,” he told Vox. About five months later, activists were approved to officially start collecting signatures , and for more than a year into the petition drive, local and national reproductive rights groups stayed relatively quiet. When I covered the pending ballot measure campaigns for abortion rights in summer 2023, Planned Parenthood North Central States had not issued any public statement and did not return my multiple requests for comment. More recently, some activists started publicly attacking the campaign, most notably in a South Dakota Searchlight article published in early December. Samantha Chapman, advocacy manager for the ACLU of South Dakota, said in the story that her organization is not encouraging people to donate or volunteer, or encouraging people to vote yes or no. She claimed grassroots groups were not consulted and blasted the ballot measure for being initiated by “women who are not of reproductive age.” (Both Nicolay and Pierosol are in their 80s.) Chapman also slammed Dakotans for Health, which she described as “ultimately run by three white men.” (Chapman was formerly married to one of Weiland’s sons.) Chapman told Vox the national ACLU and her local ACLU affiliate had no further comments for the media. Nicolay, who is currently in hospice with late-stage pancreatic cancer, told Vox she was deeply offended by Chapman’s remarks. “Quite honestly I was appalled because the gal said, ‘Well, they’re two gray-haired women; they can’t reproduce so we shouldn’t be listening to them,’” she said. “No one has any idea what I went through when I was leading the ballot measures [in 2006 and 2008]. We fought a lot of battles so they could have their rights. We fought them before and we’ll fight them again.” In the Searchlight article, Tim Stanley, of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said his organization stands with the ACLU in opposing the ballot measure. In an emailed statement to Vox, Stanley said they aren’t part of the coalition supporting the abortion rights amendment and weren’t involved in drafting it. “As the sole abortion provider in South Dakota for more than 30 years, Planned Parenthood is acutely aware of the impact policy language can have on patients’ lives,” he said. “Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood North Central States is working to build a future where sexual and reproductive health care is accessible to all South Dakotans, especially people with lower incomes, those in rural areas, LGBTQ+ and other marginalized communities.” Stanley declined multiple requests to clarify or elaborate on how Planned Parenthood is working to build that more accessible future for South Dakotans. Organizers collect petition signatures for the abortion rights ballot measure. Courtesy of Dakotans for Health Kim Floren, who cofounded the South Dakota Justice Empowerment Network, an abortion fund, said she doesn’t think the proposed measure goes far enough and raised concern with certain language, like that it uses the word “women,” which could exclude minors. Chapman pointed to Michigan as a better model for soliciting stakeholder input . Michigan’s ballot measure, which voters approved in 2022, affirms the right to make decisions about “all matters relating to pregnancy, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, contraception, sterilization, abortion care, miscarriage management, and infertility care.” Piersol said trying to get the kind of “wonderful and rather elaborate language” that activists pushed for in Michigan is unrealistic. “You’re not going to get that passed in South Dakota,” she told Vox. “We know what people will vote for, and that’s the key.” Is South Dakota’s measure likely to pass? Ballot measures protecting abortion rights have won in all seven states in which they’ve appeared since the overturn of Roe, including in red states like Kentucky, Ohio, and Montana. Some of the victories were very expensive to win, with activists raising tens of millions of dollars for the efforts in Michigan and Ohio. Organizers in South Dakota are preparing for the likelihood that they may see virtually no outside fundraising assistance, as national progressive funders like Open Society Foundations and the Fairness Project, and national abortion rights groups like Reproductive Freedom for All and Planned Parenthood, have already made clear they plan to stay out of the campaign. Funders recently told Politico they see South Dakota’s measure as having “shortcomings” and not “align[ed] with our values.” Adam Weiland said an advantage is that South Dakota does not have a pricey media market, and so he believes they can still win without national donors, as they did with Medicaid expansion. “We’re a small state and we’ve already raised upwards of a million dollars,” he told Vox. “We think we’ll need 2, 3, or 4 million to win.” In some respects, it might ultimately help that big progressive groups that heavily fund Democratic-aligned causes want to sit South Dakota out. One key way activists have been able to win over conservatives in other states is by ensuring their efforts remain aggressively nonpartisan. Still, activists leading the abortion rights ballot measure campaign in South Dakota don’t see it that way. “It is so deleterious to women to not have the force of Planned Parenthood and to not have the force of the ACLU behind a program that is specifically set up for women’s safety and health,” said Piersol. “It’s just outrageous that they have taken that position.” Right now, organizers feel cautiously optimistic about the polling trends. A survey of 500 registered voters sponsored by South Dakota News Watch from July 2022 found 65 percent of respondents supported the idea of a statewide referendum on abortion rights , and more than 75 percent backed legalizing abortion in cases of rape or incest. However, two more recent polls suggest it still may be a tough battle. In October a survey from the Hill and Emerson College found 45 percent of voters expressing support for South Dakota’s abortion ban, with 39 percent opposed and 16 percent unsure. A News Watch survey conducted in November found mixed support for the proposed amendment, with 45.6 percent of respondents supporting it, and 43.6 percent opposing it. The poll’s margin of error was 4.5 percent. Anti-abortion leaders have been cheering the public in-fighting, and SBA Pro-Life America, a national anti-abortion lobbying group, recently highlighted the Emerson College poll as what happens when “a state has a strong pro-life alliance and Planned Parenthood and the ACLU don’t throw millions into advertising.” Adam Weiland said he’s not too worried about those autumn polls and pointed out that when South Dakotans first started organizing for the 2006 ballot measure to protect abortion rights, surveys showed they were down 14 points. “Sure, South Dakotans have a more nuanced and moderate view of abortion rights than what some people might have in New York or California, but when you ask them whether or not women or young girls should be forced to carry to term, most people don’t think so,” he said. “Most people believe in the right to a choice.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","In a few generations, factory farming — the set of economic, genetic, chemical, and pharmaceutical innovations that enabled humanity to raise tens of billions of animals for food every year — has transformed America. It has polluted our water and air, ruining quality of life for people who live near animal confinements. It has altered entire landscapes, helping drive the conversion of much of the Midwest’s biodiverse prairie grasslands to soy and cornfields growing feed for billions of animals warehoused in industrial sheds. It contributes an outsized share of planet-warming emissions , heightens the risk of another zoonotic pandemic , and causes unfathomable, normalized suffering for the animals themselves. The factory farmification of the American food system dates back about a century and accelerated post-World War II. But today’s factory farms have taken on an even more extreme dimension. Forty years ago, a facility raising 100,000 chickens per year would have passed for a large factory farm; now more than three-quarters of chickens live on massive complexes that sell more than 500,000 animals annually. These mega factory farms, as some observers have called them, look more like chicken megalopolises. The same pattern holds for other animals raised for food, like cows and pigs. These trends are reflected in data released this month by the US Department of Agriculture’s Census of Agriculture , a massive report published every five years on the state of farming in America. The report reveals a picture of an ever-consolidating, ever-intensifying system of animal agriculture that’s squeezing out small and medium-sized farms and packing more animals on less land. Here are some of our top takeaways. We raise twice as many animals for food as we did in the late 1980s In 2022, the most recent year with available data, the number of chickens, cows, pigs, and turkeys in the US food system exceeded 10 billion for the first time in the census’s history — up from 5.2 billion animals in 1987. That’s largely been driven by the chickenization of the American diet. One of the most important shifts in the US food system over the last several decades has been declining beef consumption and rapidly increasing consumption of chicken , often perceived as healthier than red meat. The ethical implications of that trade are profound. As Vox has written many times , swapping beef for chicken means slaughtering many more individual animals because chickens are small, so it takes about 100 of them to get the same amount of meat as from one cow. US chicken meat consumption first surpassed beef consumption in the mid-1990s; around the same time, farm animal population growth accelerated, as seen in the chart above. Chickens now make up more than 90 percent of land animals farmed in the US. In 2022, we slaughtered 9.2 billion of them, about 27 for every person in the country. We farm so many chickens for food that they’re now the most populous bird species in the world, and scientists believe their remains may leave a permanent mark on our geological record. “We live in the Age of the Chicken,” as the New York Times put it in 2018. The numbers of other farmed animals are also massive, but next to meat chickens, they look like a rounding error. The rise of mega factory farms With every passing year, farmed animals are increasingly concentrated on the largest factory farms. In the chicken meat industry, mega factory farms that each raise more than 500,000 chickens per year now overwhelmingly dominate. In 2022, 7.2 billion chickens — the vast majority of chickens raised for meat in the US — came from one of these facilities. (The other 2 billion still overwhelmingly came from factory farms — just smaller ones.) In the egg industry, which uses about 388.5 million hens per year, the biggest factory farms are even bigger, sometimes housing millions of animals in one place. Such high concentrations of animals — and their waste — smell terrible and release hazardous air pollution linked to respiratory problems in the communities in which they’re located, a growing environmental justice issue. These facilities have also exacerbated US avian flu crises over the last decade: Having so many animals in one place means that when a case of bird flu hits one animal, it can quickly spread to hundreds of thousands of others (which also creates more opportunities for the disease to mutate into something potentially dangerous to humans). For disease control purposes, the USDA requires farms to kill every animal on a farm where a case of bird flu has been detected, setting off a chain of events that can disrupt the food supply chain and inflate egg prices . In the span of one month in spring 2022, for example, bird flu cases at just five massive egg factory farms in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Nebraska wiped out more than 4 percent of the country’s egg-laying hens. A chicken mega factory farm on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Edwin Remsberg/Getty Images And because it’s logistically difficult to cull so many animals in a massive complex, these mega factory farms have also been linked to the rise of an especially disturbing method being used to mass kill animals in the bird flu: ventilation shutdown , in which birds are killed via heatstroke using industrial heaters. Cows are enormous, so the threshold for the largest cattle farms is much lower than it is for chickens. Remember the massive fire at an 18,000-cow Texas dairy farm last April? That’s what we would call a mega dairy — and they’ve taken over the dairy industry. Although the overall population of US dairy cows is not increasing, the number of cows concentrated on the biggest dairy farms has skyrocketed over the last 30 years, as smaller operations shut down. The Texas dairy explosion last spring was a perfect illustration of the hazards of mega farms. It stemmed from a malfunction with the farm’s manure management equipment, instantly setting ablaze thousands of animals. Supersized factory farms create supersized disasters. Tens of thousands of calf hutches are visible from the roadside at Turkey Creek Dairy, Pearce, Arizona. Calves born to dairy cows are separated from their mothers soon after birth and each kept inside a penned-in hutch. Ram Daya/We Animals Media Mega dairies have been especially on the rise in the American West, Amanda Starbuck, research director for environmental advocacy group Food & Water Watch , told Vox. The group’s analysis of agricultural census data found a 60 percent increase in the number of cows in mega dairies in Oregon between 2002 and 2022. Although the state is not known for dairy production, it has seen a proliferation of especially large dairy farms in recent years, and local residents have complained about the industry’s pollution of their water supply. “Oregon has potentially the largest mega dairies in the world,” Starbuck said. The shift to mega factory farms has perhaps been even more dramatic in the pork sector. In 2022, more than 90 percent of pigs were raised on mega factory farms. Iowa, the top pork-producing state, has 30,000 fewer pig farms than it did in the late 1980s, yet it’s home to more pigs than ever. The rapid consolidation has meant that big farms are getting bigger while the rest go out of business, a trend consistent across the country. Pigs stand in pens at a farm near Le Mars, Iowa. Dan Brouillette/Bloomberg via Getty Images Many US pig farmers who can hang on do so by contracting with the biggest pork processors, like Smithfield Foods and JBS . In these contract arrangements, the farmer takes on much of the risk by taking out large loans to build the operations, while the company supplies the pigs and their feed. More than two-thirds of pigs were raised on contract in 2015. As the number of animals farmed for food has exploded, so has their waste, adding up to almost 1 trillion pounds of it each year, according to an analysis by Food & Water Watch. Between 2017 and 2022, growth in the livestock population has added manure “equivalent to two New York City metro areas — or 40 million people,” Starbuck said. The manure isn’t treated at sewage plants like human waste, but rather stored on the farm in piles or vast pits that are prone to leakage . Farmers also over-apply manure on crop fields to dispose of it and much of it washes away during storms into rivers and streams, causing widespread pollution. A Smithfield Foods hog- raising facility in Utah with large manure lagoons. Jon G. Fuller/VW Pics/Universal Images Group via Getty Images In Iowa , more than half of the state’s rivers are “impaired,” meaning they’re not suitable for at least one of their main purposes, like serving as a habitat for aquatic animals, drinking, or recreation. Animal agriculture is the main culprit , and many rural Americans who depend on wells for drinking water have found them contaminated with factory farm waste. It’s a national problem too: A recent US Environmental Protection Agency report found that a third of US river miles were considered to be in poor shape for fish, mainly due to farm runoff. Midwest farmland and its valuable fertile soil have increasingly become devoted to growing food for farmed animals, primarily corn and soy. Like manure, much of the fertilizer and pesticide sprayed on these crops washes away during storms and pollutes waterways. Livestock feed isn’t the only reason the US grows so much corn. There was a big spike in corn acreage starting in the early 2000s, when Congress mandated that billions of gallons of gasoline for cars be mixed with biofuels, which is mostly ethanol made with corn. It was a terrible policy because corn is an inefficient use of land to produce energy: “It takes about 100 acres worth of biofuels to generate as much energy as a single acre of solar panels,” wrote agriculture and environmental writer Michael Grunwald in the New York Times. But it’s been hard to roll back, given the political power of the farm lobby: Ethanol policy is “mainly a way to suck up to farmers and enrich agribusinesses,” Grunwald wrote. Almost 40 percent of US corn goes into gas tanks and 40 percent is fed to livestock, while 70 percent of soy is livestock feed. Overall farmland is decreasing It bears mentioning that industrialized agriculture is not bad per se (at least, it doesn’t have to be). Researchers and corporations have devised ways to make crops and animals grow bigger and faster, allowing us to get more food from less land. Total US farmland has declined by 24 percent since 1954 — equivalent to saving more than the combined land area of California and Texas. Making factory farming more land-efficient, though, has come with terrible costs not factored into the price tag at the supermarket: mass animal cruelty, pollution, and economic inequality . Even on its own terms, factory farming is still radically inefficient compared to a system with far fewer animals and more plant-based foods, which would require less land and water, emit less pollution and climate-warming gases, and allow the country to free up land for wild ecosystems that benefit the climate. If we’re willing to imagine a different world, one not dependent on slaughtering billions of animals for food, such a system is within reach. “The factory farm system is not inevitable,” Starbuck said.

"2","To grossly paraphrase Kim Kardashian, nobody stops working anymore . Just look at who’s in the running for the top job in the nation: a 77-year-old against an 81-year-old, both vying to keep working for another four years. Yet they’re in lockstep with a national trend — older Americans are working longer, into their 60s and even their 70s and beyond. Among Americans 65 and older, 19 percent were still working last year, which is almost a twofold increase from the late 1980s. Last year, the average retirement age was 62, according to a Gallup survey , up from 59 in the early 2000s . Older people aren’t just delaying retirement, but working longer hours: On average, this group’s annual work hours are almost 30 percent higher than they were in 1987. The question of why is hard to answer. People keep working because they want to and because they have to, and sometimes a mix of both. “You can think of it as both a reflection of empowered preferences to go work more and longer — versus curtailed savings that force you into the labor force. They’re both happening,” says economist Kathryn Edwards. Joan Madden-Ceballos, a 65-year- old health care administrator in California, has no plans to retire. She enjoys her job; it’s flexible and fulfilling. She’s not sure what she’d do with herself if she didn’t work. “I’m a baby boomer, so work is sort of ingrained in our lives,” she says. “My daughter gets so mad at me. ‘You need boundaries!’ I’m like, that’s not something baby boomers know.” She’s also making the most money she’s ever made in her career, and that’s not a non-zero factor. “Five years ago, I got a divorce. At that point, my house was paid off — but now it’s only half paid off.” Lori Hvizda Ward, 64, recently returned to teaching part-time after 27 years. “I was bored after pandemic restrictions were lifted, and my kids returned to college and high school full time,” she tells Vox. Her local school district needed more substitute teachers, and the flexibility of the schedule was a perk. But for her, too, it’s not only about personal fulfillment, but that pricey tuition too. “I thought it would be beneficial to have the extra income,” she says. We have a tight labor market right now, which means there are a lot of open jobs desperate for workers — so college-educated workers who have good, interesting jobs can more easily choose to keep working. There’s also less of a social norm to retire at a certain age than before. But what’s also undeniable is that retirement security has gotten a lot less attainable, thanks to decades of stagnant wages, recessions, an intense few years of high inflation, and the disappearance of pensions. Around the world, as people live longer — and face future shortfalls in government retirement funds — the age at which people get full retirement benefits keeps going up. Last year, French people staged massive, incendiary protests against a government proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64; the law passed anyway. In the US, anyone born after 1960 doesn’t get full retirement benefits until they turn 67. You can retire at age 62, but you’ll get less money, which is a good incentive to keep working. Congress has continued to debate whether full retirement age should be nudged even higher . Monique Morrissey, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, says that not being financially secure is likely the bigger factor in why we’re seeing more older people work for longer. In 2022, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances , almost 43 percent of people between 55 and 64 didn’t have a retirement savings account. In just the past few years, there has been a spate of viral headlines about older Americans continuing to work difficult jobs out of necessity — like an 82-year-old man working as a Walmart cashier until a GoFundMe raised $100,000, or the 89-year- old man who delivered pizza to pay his bills until he, too, received $20,000 thanks to a fundraising campaign. “It is really very much a tale of two types of older workers,” says Morrissey. “Half have it good and half have it bad.” A tale of two workers — but it’s not always clear which is which It’s true that part of why the American workforce is older is because Americans in general are older. The baby boomers — famously part of a generation in which many babies were born after World War II — are now in their 60s and 70s . Meanwhile, the birth rate since the post-war era has fallen steeply, jostling the age distribution of workers. The US is far from alone in facing a rapidly aging workforce. It’s happening across the globe in rich nations, as their populations age amid decades of falling birth rates. In Japan, almost 40 percent of workers are projected to be 55 and older by 2031. Yet the fact that there are more older Americans doesn’t totally explain the older worker phenomenon. Just look at the labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of people 16 and older who are employed or looking for work. From about 1950 to 1990, the participation rate of people 65 and older had fallen a lot. “That’s largely attributed to a larger share of the workforce getting Social Security, and it was regarded as a good thing,” says Edwards. Since the early ’90s, though, we’ve seen that trend reverse. The median age of a working American today is now 42, and what’s more, in the last few decades the participation rate of people 75-plus has increased more than that of people 65-plus. Some theories why: Americans are living longer today than in the 1980s (though Covid actually dropped the US age expectancy by a couple years, and life expectancy at age 65 in the US isn’t great compared to other wealthy nations). The share of 75-and-older workers, as a group, is more likely to include people who want to keep working rather than are forced to do so by financial circumstances, says Morrissey. Data from Pew shows that older workers are more likely to be self-employed. That may give them a little more independence to work flexible hours or to reduce work hours as they age rather than retire completely. Technology has made some jobs in some industries physically easier to perform — you can now even do work from the comfort of your home. That doesn’t mean hard labor has gone away. “There’s this idea that people used to dig ditches or they were farmers, and now they’re sitting in front of a computer,” says Morrissey. “No, they’re not. They might be stuck, if they’re lucky, stocking shelves or waiting tables, but those are not easy jobs.” One common industry for older workers, particularly older women, is caregiving. “Working in nursing homes or in people’s homes is very physically demanding and has very high injury rates,” Morrissey says. A third of home health care workers are 55 and older, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). A study of care workers in NYC shows a much higher distribution of older care workers than there is in other industries. Bus service and urban transit workers are also outliers, with a median age over 50 . According to the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis , more than 40 percent of older Black and Latino workers — people between 55 to 64 — work “physically demanding jobs” like farming, truck driving, delivery, and more. A quarter of white older workers do. It also varies by education: Over 40 percent of workers 55 to 64 without a college degree worked physically demanding jobs as of 2018, as did almost a third of those 65-plus without a degree. Older people in physically demanding jobs are also less likely to be earning enough to save a lot for retirement, or to have access to an employer- sponsored retirement account. If they retire too early, they won’t get full Social Security benefits — but sometimes they don’t have a choice if they become disabled. “All of the things that make it more likely that they didn’t save enough would also make them less likely to be able to work longer,” says Edwards. Of the workers in physical jobs who can keep working, we see many working to an older age because they need to, says Morrissey. And while age discrimination is a real and serious problem, hard, low-paying jobs — say, janitorial or caregiving work — are often less likely to reject candidates for age reasons, so it may be exactly the thing they turn to. Retirement is still a fairly new idea The idea that people stop working when they get older is still pretty fresh in the grand scheme of human history. It didn’t arise until the modern labor market did, according to Edwards, when lots of people started selling their labor to others rather than work on their family farm. “Before Social Security, most people’s retirement plan was death,” says Edwards. “Dying on the job, dying in your kid’s house. This whole notion of an independent, work-free retirement is truly a modern one.” Social Security remains the nation’s biggest anti-poverty program — by a factor of about four, Edwards adds — and mostly thanks to it, elder poverty has plummeted since the 1950s. But the program is currently on the path to a deficit by 2034 because the US is not collecting enough from the highest earners, explains Edwards. Social Security tax only applies to the first $168,600 someone makes in a year; in the last few decades, wage inequality has shot up, with a lot of income growth at the very top and mostly stagnant pay everywhere else . That means the amount of money not going toward Social Security has ballooned — and that the highest-income Americans pay a much lower effective tax rate than the lowest earners do. The program also wasn’t designed to be someone’s only retirement plan, yet people have become increasingly reliant on its benefits because they can’t save enough, and most don’t have pensions. It was meant to provide a floor for Americans, a safety net. “But we’re creating a labor market in which many people live at the floor,” says Edwards. A Credit Karma survey last year found that over a quarter of people 59 and older had no retirement savings . Part of the problem is that access to a retirement account varies greatly by industry and whether or not you’re a high earner. Pensions are now extremely rare, unless you work in the public sector, and only about half of workers have a retirement plan offered through their private employer. Low earners, people of color, and women are even less likely to have access to employer-sponsored retirement accounts. Last December, the average payment for Social Security retirement benefits was $1,905 . Whether Social Security is enough to live on depends on many factors, including marital status, debt, health care costs, and how high the cost of living is where they live. According to the BLS , about 81 percent of people between 65 and 74 are homeowners, but 30 percent still have a mortgage; 19 percent are renters. While Americans’ access to employer retirement plans is spotty, every working person pays Social Security taxes. Shoring up Social Security so that it is both well-funded and pays more, and ensuring all of its benefits are easy to access, would do a lot toward giving people retirement security — particularly for those who need it most, those who don’t work cushy jobs with generous salaries, stock rewards, or 401(k) contributions matched by their employer . Retirement is a modern concept, and it deserves to be further modernized. The fact that there are divergent reasons why Americans are working longer doesn’t change the path forward — which is to make it easier for those who do want to quit working earlier. When trying to figure out what’s going on in a labor market — like why people are working longer — it’s important to keep in mind that it’s a reflection of both people’s preferences and their constraints, says Edwards. “Both predict an outcome, and it’s not clear which one is ruling the day.” Often, individuals aren’t quite sure themselves whether it’s a preference or constraint that has led to delaying retirement. But, says Edwards, “Policy’s job is to change the constraints, knowing that preferences are varied.” Beyond fixing Social Security, Morrissey notes, we could change these constraints for older workers with better labor standards and protections, as older workers face a high rate of workplace injury, as well as better pay for workers of all ages — so that people can actually save more. “A lot of what would help older Americans would help all Americans,” says Morrissey.

"2","It is oddly hard to file your income tax return in the US without working with a private company. Over 90 percent of returns are filed either by a paid tax preparer or by a taxpayer using commercial software, like TurboTax, which can cost as much as $169 per cycle, plus extra if you have state taxes. To date, most of the Internal Revenue Service’s efforts to make tax filing more available to low-income people have involved throwing business to private companies through the “Free File Program,” in which those companies agree to prepare certain returns for free. But the tax companies, preferring profit, have worked hard to make sure people don’t actually use Free File . Over its decade-plus of operation, fewer than 3 percent of eligible taxpayers used the program. The end result is these tax companies are responsible for more than 90 percent of returns filed in the US, with Americans more or less forced to give their financial information, and usually their money, to a private company. Until this year. The 2024 filing season represents the debut of Direct File , the IRS’s new program to allow taxpayers to file their taxes directly through a government website. But there’s a catch. Well, several catches. The program is, for now, a limited pilot, available in 12 states, representing a little under half the US population. Even in those states, the software is rolling out slowly. It only opened to general users on February 22 , and then only for a small number. The IRS says it will “continue to open for new taxpayers in pilot states for short availability windows” throughout the spring. And the software is limited in what tax situations it can handle. If you have wages or salary income and/or interest income, and nothing else, you’re probably eligible. But if you have self-employment, freelance, or income from owning a business, you’re not. Treasury spokesperson Ashley Schapitl told me the IRS estimates that about one-third of taxpayers in participating states have tax situations simple enough that they can use the Direct File software. She explained that about 19 million taxpayers, total, will be eligible this season and that the department expects “at least several hundred thousand” to participate. This all, I have to admit, bummed me out slightly. For years now, I’ve been a booster of efforts to make tax filing easier and break the TurboTax/H&R; Block duopoly on tax prep. Direct File, which is the result of a provision included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act , seemed like the first effort by the federal government to do just that, to free the tax system from these parasitic corporations. And the first draft of Direct File didn’t feel big enough for the task. Some of the team building it showed the software off to me and a couple other journalists in January, and while the technical details were cool in a nerdy way (the program logic is written in Scala !), what I kept thinking was: This can’t compete with TurboTax. It can’t do my very simple taxes; I just have a W-2 from Vox and a couple 1099s from participating in a medical study . And if we’re not giving taxpayers something better than the private sector, what are we doing here? The answer, essentially, is that the IRS is taking things slowly. It didn’t want to release software capable of handling all tax situations from the start because that philosophy — build it all, deploy it suddenly — is historically a recipe for disaster in projects like this. That was, for instance, what happened with HealthCare.gov in 2013. Instead of a working product, users got so many outages, delays, and crashes that a grand total of six people were able to enroll in health insurance on the website’s first day. The idea this time was to build it gradually so that each limited form of the software works before moving forward. That might not be satisfying for impatient people like me. But it might be a wiser approach. Limitations of the pilot The 12 states participating in the Direct File pilot were chosen deliberately. They include eight states that don’t levy a general income tax (Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming), meaning there’s no need for the IRS software to integrate with a state tax system. The other four states at least had state-level Direct File systems and opted to integrate their own state tax software with the IRS’s (Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and New York). Alaska, the ninth state with no state income tax, was originally going to be in the pilot, but a Direct File staffer explained to me that the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend , an annual cash payment to all residents funded out of oil revenue, is reported on a 1099-MISC. That meant basically no one in the state would be able to use the pilot software. Early on in the software steps, users are given a couple of lists of reasons why they might not be eligible. Taxpayers who itemize their deductions won’t be able to do that in the software, for instance, and the software won’t calculate if itemizing is a better choice for you. Nor is anyone with dividend, capital gains, self-employment, or non-Social Security pension income eligible. For context, over 20 percent of taxpayers in 2022 reported dividend income. A screen of the Direct File software explaining which kinds of income make one ineligible for the program. Dylan Matthews/Vox Users can claim the three most-used tax credits — the earned income tax credit for low-income working people, the child tax credit , and the credit for other dependents, which covers dependents other than children under 17. But other common credits, like the premium credit from the Obamacare exchanges or tax credit for child care expenses or credits covering college tuition and other higher education expenses, can’t be claimed with Direct File. Educators can deduct out-of-pocket expenses, and folks with student loans can deduct their interest, but mortgage interest, charitable, state and local tax deductions, and anything else on the “itemized” list is out. For the large majority of people, the standard deduction will still wind up being a better deal, but other tax prep software gives people tools to figure out which is better. Add up all the left-out income types and unavailable credits and pretty soon you get to the IRS’s estimate that two-thirds of people in pilot states won’t be eligible to use the software this year. The case for going gradually I couldn’t use Direct File this year, both because of some 1099 income and because DC, where I live, isn’t a pilot state (or disenfranchised non-state fiefdom as the case may be). So I did my taxes in Cash App, like normal. Cash App Taxes is a bit of a funny product; why, exactly, does an app that I otherwise only use to send my dad money for my share of the Verizon family plan offer tax prep software? Even stranger is that it’s pretty good. It’s full-featured, even handling business income and some complex expensing options, and it handles state taxes too. Plus, it’s free. The company has explained that Cash App Taxes makes no revenue and exists solely as a marketing device “aimed at attracting new customers and encouraging the usage of Cash App.” There isn’t a premium option, and as someone who’d rather do my taxes with pen and paper than give any money to TurboTax or H&R; Block, I like that. I kept wondering, as I played around with Direct File, why it couldn’t just be like Cash App Taxes. Why not just buy up existing private software? Why are we reinventing the wheel? “A lot of states have free public tax filing systems, and the majority of the states that offer them use tax software from a private company,” Ariel Jurow Kleiman, a professor at Loyola Law School and an author of an independent study commissioned by the IRS to investigate the idea of a Direct File system, told me. One service, GenTax by Fast Enterprises , dominates this market. So it was certainly possible for the government to contract with a company to supply software fueling a Direct File system. But that approach comes with certain disadvantages: Enlisting private contractors raises concerns about data privacy (could this private company see my income information?) and data security (is this private company really able to secure my information against hackers?), Jurow Kleiman notes, and those are less pronounced for a government-developed product. Ayushi Roy, a veteran government technologist now at New America’s New Practice Lab , and a collaborator on the independent study with Jurow Kleiman, notes that existing private software has not been developed or optimized for the same things that we’d want to optimize Direct File for. Cash App Taxes, say, is most optimized to get people to download Cash App, not to be maximally helpful for taxpayers currently ill-served by private options. “Even if, hypothetically, the IRS were to license” a private piece of software, Roy says, that private provider might not “be able to service customer support needs in the way that this target demographic might need, that are unique to them.” That means the IRS probably wouldn’t be taking a product off the shelf. You’d be contracting a vendor to build a product — or modify an existing off-the-shelf similar product that vendor has built before — and then paying them to keep it updated and working well. That can be the worst of all worlds because it locks government into using one vendor going forward, even if that vendor fails catastrophically. That has happened before: Rhode Island’s United Health Infrastructure Project had a disastrous rollout , but the state still re- awarded the contract to fix the system to Deloitte, the same contractor that made it and was responsible for its failures in the first place. Roy notes that the US has already tried heavy reliance on private developers for tax preparation. That was the basis of the Free File system, which has only served a tiny fraction of eligible taxpayers throughout its history. Relying on these companies has failed so far; building a system from scratch in-house might avoid those problems. Of course, building the software in-house comes with its own trade-offs, not least of which is a development process where early releases have fewer features than commercial alternatives. The Direct File team is following a philosophy known in software engineering as “agile” development. Older approaches, sometimes called “plan-based” or “waterfall,” envisioned software projects as linear sequences: First you build a plan for what the software will do, then you write all the software, then you test the software. The downside is that testing, in this approach, only comes late, after much of the software has already been written. Developers don’t get regular feedback as they’re developing that they can use to strengthen the product. Agile development, by contrast, emphasizes launching more barebones products first, enabling rapid testing and iteration, ensuring very basic features are working well before moving on to additional ones. In government circles, agile approaches have gained popularity in part because of a case in which they were not used effectively: HealthCare.gov, which was infamously unreliable in its early months and was developed without much early testing and iteration. An Inspector General’s investigation of that debacle notes that while developers stated they were trying to use agile methods, time and resources weren’t available for the kind of rapid iteration and testing that would actually make it work. “That product, HealthCare.gov, was not allowed to have any sort of gradual rollout, not allowed to have a learning curve,” Roy notes. The Direct File approach is sort of the inverse of the HealthCare.gov one: lots of early testing, a pilot release before a broad release, testing with a small group of government employees before pushing to the broad public, and testing a bare-bones version first before a decked-out one. What comes next An optimistic read of the Direct File experience is that this is just the start. The limited rollout in 2024 will lead to a more full-featured rollout in 2025, perhaps extending to more states and including more kinds of income and credits. In time, perhaps the IRS can partner with states so taxpayers can file both state and federal taxes in the same software. Most excitingly, at least to me, a future version could feature pre-filling. The IRS already has all the information it needs: It receives W-2, 1099, and other tax documents from your employers, contractor clients, mortgage companies, and so forth. One of the strange things about filing your taxes, even with Direct File, is that you have to enter all this information. Jurow Kleiman has proposed letting future versions of Direct File, and of private software too, directly import these forms from the IRS . Recalling her work leading a team writing the independent report on Direct File, she says, “We felt there were no technological barriers to pre-filling.” Eliminating returns or moving to a system where entire returns are pre-filled by the IRS would take a lot more work. The barriers there are at least as much about the tax code as a lack of IRS software. For instance, the ability of married taxpayers to file joint returns, an option that isn’t available in many peer countries like the UK, Canada, and Australia, makes taxes way more complicated and prevents the IRS from withholding precisely the amount people owe. Reforming that system is a good idea but a much more challenging task. Politics, as they say, is the strong and slow boring of hard boards. And to impatient people like me, the development of Direct File can feel very slow indeed. It’s a small step toward a world where people don’t need commercial tax software. But it’s a meaningful step, and the case for taking things slow is surprisingly compelling. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","For 35 years, Soul Train was the beating heart of Black pop culture in America, considered appointment television for the millions of people who tuned in to discover the latest trends in music, dance, and fashion. In its more than 900 episodes, it launched musicians like Teena Marie , Curtis Mayfield , and the Jackson Five , and others like Vivica A. Fox , Jody Watley , and Rosie Perez , to new heights of fame. Now, 54 years after the groundbreaking show’s premiere, its impact on culture and history hasn’t diminished. The Jackson Five on the Soul Train stage in 1975 (from left: Jermaine, Randy, Tito, and Michael). Afro American Newspapers/Gado/Getty Images Soul Train was an ensemble show, featuring musicians, dancers, comedians, and special guests who came together to put on a grand show. It was glittery and glamorous, but also intimate and personal, with celebrities like Patti LaBelle , Elton John , and Little Richard mingling with the dancers in the audience. Simply put, you couldn’t miss it. Richard Gay, the producer of a soon-to-be-on- Broadway musical called Soul Train , tells Vox, “The day Soul Train was supposed to come on, we all knew we needed to have our chores done and everything together so we could watch. ... Then you got older and started tuning in so you could use the dances at the parties that weekend.” I was too young to really engage with Soul Train during my childhood (and wasn’t even alive during its peak). Still, its legacy lives on for me. From reruns, I can recall with ease the intro, with the animated train, the screech of “The Soullll Trainnn!,” and a smooth voice calling it “the hippest trip in America.” I have vivid memories of Don Cornelius, Soul Train’s founder and legendary “conductor” or host. And the iconic Soul Train line, where people make a corridor and one person has the spotlight, dancing wildly and passionately down the line as everyone claps and cheers, which showed up at so many of my family functions and parties at my alma mater, the historically Black Howard University. It’s undeniable that Soul Train has been a huge part of my life, and that of many others, even long after it stopped airing.

Soul Train via Getty Images Bethonie Butler, author of Black TV: Five Decades of Groundbreaking Television from Soul Train to Black- ish and Beyond , writes that the variety music program started as a local show on Chicago’s WCIU , a TV station that’s now part of The CW, featuring local musicians like Jerry Butler, the Chi-Lites, and the Emotions. The small local show, often described as the Black version of American Bandstand , an ensemble show that was once only for whites, quickly took off due to the culture’s hunger for the show and its host’s hunger for success. (Don Cornelius’s son said Cornelius wanted to be the “next Black Dick Clark,” the host of American Bandstand .) “Once people start to hear about it, then the big acts wanted to be a part of it. I know for a fact his initial bookings of the show were not the biggest acts,” Tony Cornelius, Don’s son, told KCRW . “But the biggest acts decided that they wanted to be a part of it and it became the place to be, because everyone started to hear about this phenomenon.” Its tremendous popularity — it remains the longest first-run syndicated television series in broadcast history — and a key partnership with Johnson Products , the makers of the Afro-Sheen hair care brand, led to its status as a radical show for the times, slotted next to commercials that proudly showcased natural hairstyles like glistening Afros and fluffy tresses in spite of the pressure for Black hair to conform to European standards. Suddenly it wasn’t just Black music or dance on the national stage, but our hair as well. Don Cornelius interviews Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. of the 5th Dimension on Soul Train in 1973. Soul Train via Getty Images Black fashion was also a huge part of the show’s success. When people came on Soul Train , they dressed their best. Rich and bright colors, textured fabrics of thick satin and corduroy, dashikis and sequined blazers with shoulder pads and gleaming gold buttons, sharp angles and soft leathers. The fashion was unique and bright, consisting of bell bottoms, exaggerated collars, and flowy blouses. It was a richness of style that felt like seeing the best of ourselves in a time when Black people on TV were often reduced to minstrels — characters that exaggerate negative stereotypes of Black people — or weren’t included at all. In his 20s, when he was still working for WCIU, Don Cornelius reported on social unrest and met figures like Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tony Cornelius told KCRW , “My father initially just wanted to do a show that presented Blacks in a positive light, because there was nothing like that going on. I mean, the only thing that you saw about African Americans was on the news where they were being arrested or something.” It was glittery and glamorous, but also intimate and personal Gay, who stood in the lobby after every performance of his musical in the Bay Area, was surprised when Fredrika Newton, the widow of Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the revolutionary Black Panther Party who was murdered in 1989, came up to him to thank him for the nod in the show to the civil rights movement, including the Black Panther Party. “She was almost in tears and she was like, ‘Me and Huey used to watch Soul Train every Saturday. It would bring us joy.’” Cassie Taylor, a musician whose upbringing was greatly influenced by Soul Train and her father, blues musician Otis Taylor, told me, “Black culture was demonized by the majority of white media, and Soul Train was a place for people to safely express themselves. ... It retains its iconicism because the joy is contagious.” Taylor, who has had a supplemental business from flipping vintage clothing in the past, said her childhood memories of Soul Train informed what she looked for in vintage and thrift shops for her customers. Entertainers like Bill Withers, Al Green, Bobby Womack, Little Richard, Stevie Wonder, and Marvin Gaye all furthered their careers by appearing on the show. From Soul Train dancer Jeffrey Daniel, Michael Jackson learned the robot and “backslide,” which was renamed the moonwalk, Jackson’s trademark dance. Part of Aretha Franklin’s great fame came from her appearance on the show. After Don Cornelius’s death in 2008, Franklin told ABC that “An appearance on ‘ Soul Train’ meant, what it could mean, a person being virtually an unknown person to an American sensation overnight, very similar to ‘American Idol.’” She said, “It was like if you had a record that sold maybe 10,000 copies, to be on ‘ Soul Train ’ meant it might sell 100 to 200- to 300- or even 500,000 or more.” Al Green performs “L-O-V-E (Love)” live on Soul Train in 1975. Soul Train via Getty Images The Soul Train Dancers circa 1973-1976. Soul Train via Getty Images Despite — or perhaps because of — its emphasis on joy and togetherness, Soul Train was a response to an incredibly bleak time for Black Americans . When it premiered in 1970 in Chicago , Black Americans like my grandparents were still fleeing racial terror and poverty in the South as part of the Great Migration. Segregation had ended legally, but its disastrous effects were still felt in Black communities everywhere. Veronica McComb, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Bryant University, told me in an interview that “Black bodies were constantly in danger to a high degree. To be in a safe and protected space to express themselves physically in the form of dress and dance was just, as they say, it was everything.” Soul Train premiered at a time when those who had already migrated were still trying to find community and navigate new racial discrimination in different contexts. “If you’re away from home, like many African Americans were as part of the Great Migration, Soul Train definitely gave you that stronger sense of home,” McComb said. The act of watching became not only a space to gather but a conversation point the next morning at school or work, a way for Black people to find each other in all spaces. Segregation continued socially, with Black people being chased out of white neighborhoods and schools, while Black neighborhoods and schools remaining overpoliced and underfunded. Lynchings continued, and sundown towns didn’t cease their violence toward Black people. Meanwhile, those who managed to integrate faced their own set of challenges — some of which were intensified. “Integration wasn’t necessarily the wonderful thing that it was intended to be in terms of creating better equity and equality for African Americans,” McComb said. “In some cases, it created a lot of inequity and even more discrimination. ... Soul Train having a space for African Americans was a form of resistance against the forces that would say, ‘You are still not equal; you are still not valued.’ It was a way to say, ‘Yes, we are indeed.’” “There’s an element of spontaneity to the show that just doesn’t exist much anymore” For most of its airing, non-Black performers and guests on Soul Train were rare. “It had to be a very particular type of entertainer that was valued by the Black community to be accepted onto Soul Train, because it was such a protected space for Black expression and Black entertainment,” McComb said. Gay’s Soul Train musical delves into the entrepreneur and visionary Don Cornelius’s biggest project. “He was a kingmaker, right? At the show’s height, you had people like Elton John going, ‘I have this giant audience that knows ‘Crocodile Rock’ that doesn’t look like me. How do I reach them? Well, Soul Train was the answer to that,” said Gay. On May 17, 1975, Elton John became the first white performer to appear on the show. After that, Soul Train became a sort of litmus test for all musicians but especially white ones. There was a difference between only making music for white people and making music that Black people could jive to as well, a sort of encapsulation of the radicalism of Soul Train. Here, in this integrated space, Black folks made the culture and determined who could cross over into our spaces, an act that truly could transform singers and widen their audience.

Soul Train via Getty Images It was also a time when popular forms of Black creativity were more accessible. It didn’t cost three months’ rent to see our biggest stars in concert, and spending hundreds on an outfit was unheard of. Pictures of Soul Train from its height show the special environment it cultivated. One in particular shows Marvin Gaye in the crowd , at the audience’s level, smiling and interacting as equals. The fashion was textured, layered, quality, and unique. It was a kind of fashion culture that would be hard to reproduce today because the way we make and consume clothes — in factories with labor exploitation, producing waste that is contributing mightily to the existential climate crisis , and simply making clothes less stylish — has changed radically, for the very worst. We are in a similar state of despair as the one that Soul Train was born out of. Covid-19 isolated people for months and killed more than a million Americans. Economic instability and student loan debt are crushing people’s hopes for the future. Police brutality is a constant worry for Black people and other marginalized groups. Our court system appears ever more imperiled . We are watching devastating violence take place overseas. This has all taken a tremendous toll on the collective psyche. In the face of such despair, it’s natural that people express a rising dissent against the disappointments of this world, and are actively looking for artistic spaces to express that dissent. “We are in a post-pandemic world and we need a reboot of Soul Train ,” Taylor says, adding that the horrors of late-stage capitalism make this more urgent. Soul Train was revolutionary, but Cornelius was a skilled businessman who went after numbers. Yet Soul Train feels anti-capitalist in some ways in retrospect, not because it was created that way, but because we live in a more flagrantly exploitative and consumerist society than ever before. The show was still revolutionary because of its assertion of Black people’s right to joy and unbridled expression in the face of forces meant to destroy our bodies and souls. Much of why people loved Soul Train was the intimacy and spontaneity. We live in a time when much of our culture is intensely curated by algorithms and trends, where fast fashion and cosmetic surgeries have produced an eerie sense of sameness, and when public images are more carefully managed than ever before, making it difficult to assess who artists truly are. “ Soul Train wasn’t very structured,” said McComb. “There’s an element of spontaneity to the show that just doesn’t exist much anymore. ... There’s this very strong sense of control that exists in American entertainment, broadly speaking, that didn’t exist at the time of Soul Train .” Don Cornelius and the Soul Train Dancers doing the signature Soul Train show ending by shouting “Love, peace, and soul” in 1982. Soul Train via Getty Images McComb said that when the spirit of Soul Train truly returns, we likely won’t see it through the same medium. “It may not be on television that we will see protected spaces where people can be their authentic selves. I don’t have much hope for American public entertainment to provide that space,” she said. She points out that one of the places where this kind of self-expression is seen most often is in spaces that fly under the radar of pop culture. “When people take over warehouses and abandoned buildings and host parties there, that is a means of transgressing and rebelling against the structures and the controls of American capitalism. That’s the closest thing I can think of to Soul Train .” However, this isn’t necessarily a negative for McComb (although she stresses that she doesn’t endorse the takeover of abandoned buildings). “We’re at a saturation point in American entertainment where there’s just so much messaging and stimuli, that maybe it is the lived experience of that unbridled authenticity that will have a revival.” The beauty of Soul Train was that “it was the kind of unbridled celebration that you would see in your own home or in your own community, but on American television,” McComb said. For now, then, offscreen, Soul Train lives on in the impromptu line dances we do at weddings, parties, and any function where Black people feel joy and freedom. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Is oat milk good or bad for you? That’s the question a bunch of recent news headlines have asked. I really hate that question. Obviously, how the food we eat affects our health is very important. But most foods — including nondairy milks — are not universally good or bad for everyone. Whether or not oat milk is bad for your health depends on a lot of things: your current body condition, the context in which you’re consuming it, and how much of it you’re drinking, to name a few. “Simple ‘good or bad’ stories about traditional milk or nondairy milks, such as oat milk, often overlook the complexity of nutrition,” Hassan Vatanparast, a professor of nutrition at the University of Saskatchewan who has studied non-dairy milks, told me over email. This healthy/unhealthy dichotomy also obscures a much more complicated set of factors that determine what we eat. For many of us, health is high on that list. But so is taste, cost, presence of allergens, and environmental impact. We live in a time that begs us to think beyond ourselves, beyond our bodies, and to recognize that what we eat affects the world around us — often in very serious ways. So, what should we drink? That question has been gnawing at me, and so I read some things and talked to some experts to try to figure it out. Do you have feedback on this story, tips about the milk industry, or just want to share what you think about oat milk? Reach out to this author at benji.jones@vox.com . If you’re a healthy person, a daily oat milk latte is not a problem Many recent stories about oat milk raise concerns about the drink’s effect on blood sugar — more specifically, that it causes a spike in blood sugar following consumption. So let’s start there. Repeated spikes in blood sugar (i.e., a fast build-up of glucose in your blood) are famously not good. It’s linked to cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes. What does oat milk have to do with it? It’s higher in starch (a carb) than some other nondairy milks, and starch is converted into simple sugars when you digest it. That raises your blood sugar. (This conversion of starch to more simple sugars also happens when oats are processed into oat milk, which is why oat milk often tastes somewhat sweet, even if sugar isn’t listed as an ingredient.) But it’s normal for food to raise your blood sugar, especially if that food is a processed grain. For most people, that won’t be a problem. If you’re healthy and not loading your diet with starchy carbs, you should have no problem regulating your blood sugar after a cup of oat milk and bringing glucose levels back down after a spike. To be clear, oat milk is not a sugary drink like, say, soda. Going a bit deeper: Nutritionists use a rating system called the glycemic index to measure how quickly different foods raise our blood sugar (which is different from just the total amount of sugar in something because different kinds of sugar have different effects on blood sugar — it’s confusing). In general, oat milk has only a “moderate” glycemic index, Vatanparast told me. That means it’s not particularly bad for blood sugar or particularly good. I asked the oat milk company Oatly about this, too. The company’s nutrition specialist, Kate Twine, said that its popular Barista Edition, which is slightly fattier than regular Oatly, has a medium glycemic index. If you factor in the serving size (e.g., one cup), using a related measure called glycemic load , the blood sugar profile is even better — the glycemic load is “low,” she said. One somewhat obvious takeaway is that the amount of milk (and thus carbs) you’re drinking matters. What you’re consuming with it matters, too. Foods high in fiber, protein, and fat can blunt the impact on blood sugar because they slow down the absorption of glucose. (Cow’s milk has a lower glycemic index than oat milk and other nondairy milks , but a more comparable glycemic load. Rice milk, meanwhile, has a very high glycemic index and load. The bottom line: A cup of oat milk is probably not going to be a problem for blood sugar.) But there’s an important caveat: For people with diabetes or insulin resistance, glucose — and the presence of starchy carbs — obviously matters a lot more. “If you have diabetes, oat milk may not be the best option since it’s one of the higher carbohydrate-containing milk substitutes,” Marion Groetch, a registered dietitian and director of nutrition services at Jaffe Food Allergy Institute, a division of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told me. But if you’re not diabetic and otherwise eat well, Groetch said, there’s not much of a concern with having an oat milk latte every day. Some other health- related considerations: Oat milk tends to be lower in protein, compared to dairy and soy milk. But you probably don’t have to worry about that . These milks are typically higher in fiber and lower in fat than dairy and some other nondairy milks, such as coconut (assuming you avoid full-fat options or those with added sugar). Additives like rapeseed oil and emulsifiers (which essentially prevent the ingredients from separating), common among nondairy milks including oat milk, are generally recognized as safe by national and international health authorities, Vatanparast said. That said, there’s some research linking emulsifiers — and especially synthetic emulsifiers like carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80 — to potentially harmful changes in the gut microbiome. The real-world implications are not clear or well-tested. The studies I read suggest that there aren’t serious safety concerns with the emulsifiers used by popular oat milk brands (I reviewed several), such as gellan gum , though more research is needed. So, where does that leave us? Drinking oat milk is probably fine for your body unless you’re drinking large quantities of it, already loading your diet with carbs, and/or diabetic. If most of your day’s liquid is coming from any milk, plant-based or not, that’s probably not great. Moderation is key. The other reason why you might consider a milk “good” or “bad” Now is a good time to mention: I’m not vegan, I occasionally eat dairy, and I don’t really love any of the nondairy milks. They’re all kind of eh . But I typically choose to consume oat and soy milks because they taste good enough in coffee and cereal, I can afford them, and, importantly, it’s an easy way to support the welfare of cows and reduce my carbon footprint. That’s another reason why I find the “is it good vs. bad for you” debate over oat milk kind of icky: It distracts from these other important considerations, catering instead to the public’s desire for simple, comfortable answers. I want choosing something as basic as milk to be simple, but it’s not. My personal perspective is that I like cows, and the treatment they receive at a typical dairy seems, at best, unkind. Farmers repeatedly impregnate cows and take away their calves right after they’re born. If those babies are male, they are usually turned into veal or raised for beef. If they’re female, the calves are typically dehorned and docked, and also eventually slaughtered (when their milk production wanes). I’m having trouble imagining that this is a happy existence. I’m also aware that, globally, a liter of dairy milk produces around three times as much carbon emissions as the same amount of plant-based milk. Cows release methane, a potent greenhouse gas, through their burps and manure. The chart below, drawing on a 2018 study from the journal Science, is especially revealing. It shows that nondairy milks — and especially oat milk — not only release fewer emissions but also require less land and water. They tend to pollute less, too. (Growing feed for cows requires a lot of land, fertilizers, and pesticides.) I don’t mean to imply that avoiding dairy is an easy choice. It requires wrestling with the pain that a declining dairy industry would cause. I’ve met loads of farmers in my career as a journalist (and before that as a researcher), and it’s clear to me that they love their animals. Many of them are also working to reduce their emissions . Farming families also obviously make their living from consumer demand for dairy products (just as other farmers make their living from growing plants). The growing popularity of oat milk is a threat, and one that a powerful dairy lobby is trying hard to eliminate . I don’t live under the delusion that by not drinking dairy I live a cruelty-free life. No such life exists. The coffee I put my milk in likely comes from land that’s been cleared of forests (once home to a more abundant array of wildlife). The cafes I go to use plastic lids. My clothes come from oil (nylon) and industrial fields of cotton. It’s a nightmare! Nonetheless, I’ll probably continue opting for plant-based drinks. Drinking oat milk is not obviously bad or good, but relative to other ways I can help out, it’s easy. I’m increasingly aware — I almost wish I wasn’t — that choosing to buy dairy is choosing to cause harm to farm animals, wildlife, and our planet. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","Sportscaster and CNN contributor Bob Costas made headlines recently by calling former President Donald Trump “by far the most disgraceful figure in modern presidential history” and referring to Trump supporters as being “in the throes of some sort of toxic delusion in a toxic cult.” Which raises the question: What is Bob Costas’ definition of “disgraceful”? Is it disgraceful for a president of the United States to carry on an extramarital affair with a woman who also shared a bed with a leading mafia figure and who served as a courier between Kennedy and the mob? Is it disgraceful for a president of the United States to seduce a 19-year-old intern in the White House and to persuade that intern to provide sexual favors to the president’s brother and a presidential assistant? Is it disgraceful for a president of the United States to secretly receive injections of amphetamines and other mind-altering drugs from a physician known to White House aides as “Dr. Feelgood”? Is it disgraceful for a president of the United States to solicit, or have his aids solicit, prostitutes for sex? Is it disgraceful for a president of the United States to request the services of a prostitute who looked like his wife? Is it disgraceful for a presidential candidate to have his slate of electors vote in a state’s contested presidential election when his opponent was declared the certified winner of that state’s electoral vote? The president who did all of these “disgraceful” things was John F. Kennedy. Would Bob Costas call those who still regard Kennedy with awe and admiration a “toxic cult”? Presumably, this would include the presidential “experts” who rank Kennedy as one of our greatest presidents . (RELATED from Francis P. Sempa: Ranking Presidents, Miseducating Our Children ) Let us look at some other presidents and their “disgraceful” acts or omissions. Woodrow Wilson mandated that the federal workforce be segregated by race. As Vox’s Dylan Matthews wrote in 2015 , Wilson was “extremely racist — even by the standards of his time.” He infamously showed the racist movie The Birth of a Nation , a positive portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan, at the White House. Wilson supported and used the Espionage Act and Sedition Act to stifle dissent during World War I, repressing political speech and prosecuting and imprisoning opponents of the war. Writer Jonah Goldberg labeled Wilson a “liberal fascist.” Wilson also hid his debilitating strokes from the American people, even as his uncompromising stance on the League of Nations doomed U.S. involvement. Perhaps Costas is unaware of Wilson’s “disgraceful” acts. Franklin Roosevelt carried on extramarital affairs with other women. He weaponized the IRS to go after political opponents. He also incarcerated in internment camps more than 100,000 people of Japanese ancestry because they were Japanese. FDR refused to come to the aid of potential Jewish refugees from Germany and other countries before and during World War II. He was complicit in covering up Stalin’s massive war crime in the Katyn Forest and in the forcible repatriation of Russians to Stalin’s Gulag and firing squads near the end of World War II. Would Bob Costas find any of those things “disgraceful?” Are the legions of FDR admirers, including those presidential “experts” who recently ranked him as our second-greatest president , a “toxic cult”? Lyndon Johnson, wrote one reviewer of Robert Caro’s massive biography of the 36 th president of the United States, “was corrupt, cruel, callous, crude, a vicious user of women, a bully of men and a shameless thief of elections.” He “embarrass[ed] subordinates” by making them listen to him talk “while he defecated.” He urinated in a washbasin in his office in the presence of female secretaries. He would humiliate his wife by slipping his hand under another woman’s skirt in her presence. He sent nearly 60,000 American boys to their deaths in Southeast Asia in a war that he repeatedly escalated but had no plan for winning. Does Costas think that Trump has done anything more disgraceful than that? And then there is Bill Clinton. From Whitewater to Troopergate to Monica Lewinsky to renting out the Lincoln bedroom to donors, scandal after scandal plagued the 42 nd president. He lied to a grand jury and to the American people and was credibly accused of obstructing justice. He was impeached on those grounds but acquitted by the Senate. He had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky, including receiving oral sex near the Oval Office. He was accused by at least two women of rape and sexual assault. Does Bob Costas believe that those who continue to admire Bill Clinton are part of a “toxic cult”? Perhaps for Bob Costas “disgraceful” is all relative. And history — including the sordid history of “disgraceful” Democratic presidents — is merely ignored."
"1","A t least officially, Donald Trump is not yet the Republican nominee for president, but you wouldn’t have known it from attending CPAC 2024. Just down the Potomac River from the Swamp they wish to reconquer, attendees of the yearly conservative conference/party were in a clear mood to get on to the rematch — and the vindication — they’ve spent years waiting for. During the two days I observed the conference, there were speakers other than the former president, to be sure. The words emblazoned above and to each side of the stage might have been that CPAC is “where globalism goes to die,” but that sentiment was wounded by quite an international crowd. Among them were British MP Nigel Farage; a son of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro; the leader of Spain’s Vox party; and a Hungarian whose accent amusingly had him speak on the dangers of the “vook.” Argentine President Javier Milei gave a lecture on neoclassical economics that was as informative as it was jarringly out of place. Of the Americans, a panel with former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, and North Carolina Rep. Dan Bishop on legal issues was interesting. But let us deal in reality for a second: The energy, the vibe , was all about our once and perhaps future president, Donald John Trump. Though he would not arrive until Saturday, the final day of the conference, the two most interesting speeches on Friday seemed to consider him alone their audience. When New York Rep. Elise Stefanik took the stage, she seemed to have two goals: to defend the former president and to eviscerate his enemies as though they were university presidents . Her straightforward argument to be named Trump’s No. 2 focused primarily on loyalty. Stefanik reminded the audience it was she who removed former Rep. Liz Cheney from GOP leadership before Wyoming voters disposed of her themselves . South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem also made a vice-presidential pitch that can generously be described as thinly veiled. She, however, took the interesting tack of telegraphing how she would message to voters in the general election. Intermixed with a stump speech about her conservative credentials, Noem talked about how she became the first woman elected governor of her state and her hopes that the win would inspire girls to achieve victories of their own. At CPAC this line felt conspicuously out of place, but it’s easy to see how it might play well in a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. (RELATED: Trump’s Leading VP Contender Makes Her Audition ) The main event on Saturday, however, was Trump’s appearance. The former president was slated to speak for a whole hour, longer than anyone else. It was clear that neither the audience nor the organizers would be interested in keeping him within this allotted time. And why would they? He was like a rock star on tour, and this was his crowd. The delay between Trump’s introduction by Matt and Mercedes Schlapp and his entrance seemed to take forever. As the first song played throughout the room, everybody stood at attention, seeking to get a first glimpse as he took the stage. By the fourth song, most had once again taken their seats. Journalists began taking selfies out of boredom. As “Dancing Queen” blared, two of them even began a dance — a fairly good one to my untrained eye. Then, you saw it: He was just a glimmer a long way away, but the clapping-and- walking motion was unmistakable. So was the crowd’s enthusiasm. Many CPAC speakers were clearly (and understandably!) uncomfortable talking to such a large crowd. A few were used to it, mostly professional politicians, and acquitted themselves better. An honorable mention must go to Vivek Ramaswamy, the upstart presidential candidate who parlayed himself from obscurity. He knew how to build the crowd into a crescendo of applause as he hammered his main point, and it showed. Trump, though, is in another league. To say that the Donald feeds on the energy of the audience is one thing, and you can nod along to the notion academically after watching him on television. But it takes being in the room with him to really appreciate. Trump clearly had an outline of what he wanted to discuss, but he spoke for just shy of two hours mostly off the cuff. He hit all of the notes you would have expected him to. He slammed the civil and criminal cases brought against him as “bullshit.” He laced into “the Biden nightmare,” singling out his handling of immigration and the economy and warning that “the worst is yet to come” if the incumbent is reelected. In a genuinely hilarious moment, he mocked Joe Biden’s fitness for office by miming the president wandering around aimlessly, unable to find his way off the stage. He launched into multiple stories and tangents, assuring the audience that “nobody can ramble like this.” His choice of anecdotes was well chosen: He described his fear during a dark plane descent into an Iraqi airfield to meet with his generals about the defeat of ISIS along with his negotiations with Mexico on his aptly named “remain in Mexico” policy. These stories were told with the typical Trumpian humor, but they also served to highlight his experience and accomplishments as commander-in-chief. He told the audience that, perhaps pivoting the general election, his success would be retribution enough. In contrasting himself with Biden and arguing why he should be given a second chance, his speech at CPAC has to be counted as a success. After the final speaker Saturday night, I made my way to the watch party for the South Carolina primary results. Following the flow of the crowd, I approached the entrance but was stopped by a doorwoman. “Sorry, no media allowed,” she said. It was hard to be too annoyed because evidently there wasn’t much worth watching; 15 minutes later the polls closed, and the race was instantaneously called for Trump.

"1","Each culture begets its own storybook tropes. They’re rough outlines of plots that dictate the development of fables and stories. During much of the Middle Ages, princes had to undergo tests of courage and strength to win the hand of a fair princess. In the modern age, marketing geniuses (usually the villain) exploit mad scientists to create successful business ventures. The stories we tell about ourselves say something about our cultures precisely because they’re usually based on reality. For instance, Nike is the perfect example of the perfect modern storybook trope. (READ MORE: Betting on Sports: The Super Bowl of Cronyism ) Phil Knight may not have been the villain of Nike’s story — but he certainly had a mad scientist to work with in Bill Bowerman, a track- and-field coach in Oregon with a problem. Bowerman’s problem was that his track was getting an upgrade. It was being resurfaced with a brand-new, modern artificial surface. That was great, except Bowerman’s athletes could no longer use their spikes on the track, which didn’t leave them with many great footwear options. Because he was a mad scientist, Bowerman resolved to fix the issue — and he did so while sticking his fork into a stack of waffles in 1971. (READ MORE: The Most Influential Dissidents in Sports During the Biden Regime ) Inspired by the shape of the indentations in the waffles, Bowerman rushed off to the garage to mix up some urethane and poured it directly into the waffle maker. The waffle maker was promptly destroyed (it was a wedding present), but the first, early prototype of the waffle trainer was created. Three years later, on Feb. 26, 1974, a tiny footwear business in Oregon — owned by Bowerman and Knight — patented the shoe. When it hit stores and tracks later that year, the shoe took off, quickly turning Nike into one of the most successful business ventures of the 20th century.

"1","T he Hollywood Reporter dispatched its senior editor of diversity and inclusion — you ever wonder why so many publications fail? — to review Shane Gillis on Saturday Night Live as “meh.” The Daily Beast and NPR declared that Gillis “bombed.” The latter’s Eric Deggans begrudgingly called Saturday’s “an okay episode” and gleefully dubbed Gillis “a middling talent.” The former’s Michael Boyle complained, “It seemed like SNL was engaging in its yearly cynical ratings ploy of platforming a controversial right-wing figure, regardless of what its regular audience members think.” Gillis, like Elon Musk, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Chappelle before him, did not support Donald Trump. Instead, like them, he ran afoul of the thought police by recalcitrantly not embracing every progressive tenet. For this, NPR and its ilk label him and the lot of them “right-wing.” For this, NPR and its ilk reflexively pan their SNL appearances. Their reviews fail for the same reason Saturday Night Live habitually does. We know the article before we read it, and we know the joke before they tell it. Jokes are like ambushes. They rely on the element of surprise to work. Shane Gillis succeeded on Saturday because he put the “live” into Saturday Night Live . Two minutes into his monologue , one might forgive the viewer for sensing the host nervous and his standup flailing. Then he used his mother as a prop. “My mom asked me, she’s like, ‘When did we stop being best friends?’” he explained to the crowd surrounding his mom. “And she’s right, we used to be best friends. You remember when you were a little boy and you’re like — you love your mom and you thought she was the cool — you remember when you were gay?” Then he pivoted to talk about his niece with Down syndrome, how the condition “nicked” him, and the slow service at the coffee shop that his family opened employing mentally challenged workers. When Chloe Troast played Elise Stefanik as the villain questioning Ivy League presidents months back, it came across as the rote liberalism the show strangely has become known for in the last decade. The design seemed not to promote laughter but to nudge viewers toward a correct opinion. Saturday night’s host put comedy first on a program that routinely corrupts its purpose by regarding politics as the prime objective. (RELATED: I Miss Comedy in America. Just Look at Saturday Night Live . ) Gillis, who resembles every bowler ever, shocked in not using bumper rails. That his set followed cast regulars — relying on a script drawn from actual quotations that made the skit, like so much else on the show, seem more journalism than humor — playing Republicans afraid to criticize Donald Trump in a hackneyed cold-open almost designed to sabotage the host in repulsing his audience actually amplified Gillis’ reorientation of the program in his monologue. In the bits that followed, Gillis imitated Trump far better than the show’s house impersonator, hilariously played Forrest Gump’s high school bully at their class reunion, and, in the best skit of the night, portrayed a socially clueless employee at an office sexual harassment workshop. Even his fake ad cut from the broadcast — a parody of LiMu Emu & Doug as dirty cops — bested the stale material normally featured on the program. Nearly five years ago, after Saturday Night Live embraced cancel culture in firing Gillis four days after they hired him, show alum Norm Macdonald repeatedly torched the failed comedian who dredged up Gillis’ edgy podcast material to secure his termination. An NBC executive similarly, and famously, canned Macdonald for broaching a subject he wanted him to avoid. And Norm, like Shane, redemptively returned to host the show. Unfortunately, the older comic did not live to see the younger standup’s triumph. He did, however, predict it. “In a war for comedy,” Macdonald privately messaged Gillis during his ordeal, “I think the ones with jokes will win.” The jokes won on Saturday night."

"1","T here are many terrifying happenings going on in the world today. The Middle East is a tinder box with nuclear bomb kindling. The terrorist enemies of Israel, the most glorious nation on earth after America, have resorted to war crimes and crimes against humanity that would make Himmler blush. “The world” defends these horribly sick men and women everywhere except here in America and in the Philippines and in some places in Western Europe. Even in our beloved America, powerful members of Congress, for some reason all blacks and all women, defend murderous rapists and torturers of women and girls if the victims are Jews and the criminals are Muslims. Our President and his staff say little or nothing to condemn this evil. And then there is Iran, thinly “disguised” as “Houthi rebels,” attacking merchant and naval shipping on the high seas, a real war against the West and Japan already underway. All of these are dreadful. But something else is happening. To my mind, it’s just as terrible. It is an attack on the Constitution by the leftists of the Democrat party. In that attack, prosecutors and grand juries and hyper-political media are attacking elected officials and a future President through sham trials for made-up violations of law. These legal fictions, eerily reminiscent of Comrade Stalin’s Show Trials of the 1930s, would be comical were it not for this fact: there are so many attacks, so many “indictments” scattered wherever a militant leftist prosecutor can find a grand jury, that even a man of Mr. Trump’s resourcefulness and intelligence has an almost impossible task swatting them away. They are a swarm of poisonous hornets and even a powerful man and powerful political party will not be able to defeat them. They are a plague of wasps attacking a lion: the lion can kill thousands of them, but eventually, they will take him down. This is a new form of Civil War . It can outrun the Constitution if the Supreme Court does not stop it now by Presidential Immunity. And even then, what happens when we have a new court, who’s to say what the law will be? Will we even have a Constitution? Can Prosecutorial misconduct defeat the Founding Fathers? So far, so bad.

"1","I n an important and timely essay in Foreign Affairs , the Naval War College’s Andrew Erickson, Gabriel Collins of Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, and Matt Pottinger, who served as President Trump’s Deputy National Security Adviser, invoke General Douglas MacArthur to warn of the catastrophic consequences that would result from Communist China’s takeover of Taiwan. In 1950, the authors note, in a top-secret memo written when MacArthur was overseeing the recovery and transformation of Japan from a militaristic imperial power to a democratic ally of the United States, MacArthur said that the fall of Taiwan (which was then commonly called “Formosa”) “would be a disaster of utmost importance to the United States.” “More than 70 years later,” the authors write, “MacArthur’s words ring truer than ever.” Erickson, Collins, and Pottinger believe that Taiwan is even more important to U.S. national security now than it was at the time MacArthur wrote the memo. Today, unlike in the 1950s, Taiwan is a flourishing democracy whose independence puts the lie to the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) claim that China’s prosperity depends on the party’s totalitarian rule. Taiwan, like West Berlin was during the Cold War, is an “island” of freedom that attracts freedom-loving peoples (in Taiwan’s case, their Chinese cousins on the mainland) suffering from communist oppression, and thereby threatens the CCP’s legitimacy. Also, unlike the 1950s, Taiwan “is economically crucial to the rest of the world” due to its production of most of the world’s advanced microchips. Furthermore, the authors note, unlike in MacArthur’s time, the Indo-Pacific region hosts a “wide network of U.S. allies … that rely on U.S. support for their security.” The loss of Taiwan would erode U.S. credibility to the point where our regional allies might release the nuclear weapons genie with incalculable consequences for East Asia and the rest of the world. And Communist China is today a much more formidable challenger to American security interests than it was in the 1950s. (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: Ranking Presidents, Miseducating Our Children ) MacArthur, the authors recall, compared Taiwan to an “unsinkable aircraft carrier and submarine tender” that could threaten U.S. forces in Japan and the Philippines. The Communists could, MacArthur said, use Taiwan as a “springboard for military aggression” in East Asia and the Pacific. The United States, on the other hand, can use Taiwan to help contain Chinese ambitions in the western Pacific. What else not mentioned by Erickson, Collins, and Pottinger did MacArthur say about the importance of Taiwan? In his famous “Old Soldiers Never Die” address to Congress after being relieved of command in Korea by President Truman, MacArthur noted that the United States controls the Pacific Ocean to the shores of Asia “by a chain of islands extending in an arc from the Aleutians to the Marianas.” “From this island chain,” he said, “we can dominate with sea and air power every Asiatic port from Vladivostok to Singapore … and prevent any hostile movement into the Pacific.” The island chain — what MacArthur called a “littoral defense line in the western Pacific” — was anchored by Taiwan. “[U]nder no circumstances,” MacArthur said, “must Formosa fall under Communist control. Such an eventuality would at once threaten the freedom of the Philippines and the loss of Japan and might well force our western frontier back to the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington.” MacArthur noted that the people of Taiwan under the government of Chiang Kai-shek “appear to be advancing along sound and constructive lines” politically, economically, and socially. That is even more true of Taiwan’s people today. (READ MORE: Joseph Nye Claims Trump Supporters Are a Greater Threat Than China ) Thanks to Erickson, Collins, and Pottinger Douglas MacArthur’s voice from more than 70 years ago echoes today in the waves of the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, and throughout the western Pacific. We ignore that voice at our peril."
"1","One of the funniest passages in Mark Twain’s autobiography involves the effect of old age on his mental acuity: “When I was younger, I could remember anything, whether it had happened or not; but my faculties are decaying now and soon I shall be so I cannot remember any but the things that never happened.” It’s less amusing when we recall that this could have been said by President Biden — if he could string together two coherent sentences. The latest example of his ability to remember things that never happened occurred last week, when he told fundraisers that foreign leaders have warned him former President Trump threatens democracy. According to a CNN report Biden said, “As I walk out of meetings, a head of state will find an excuse to come up close … and say, ‘You’ve got to win.’ Not because I’m so special. ‘You’ve got to win because my democracy is at stake if the other guy wins.’ Nine heads of state have done that with me.” Even if we accept the implausible claim that so many foreign leaders would be this indiscreet about Trump, a man who may very well be the President of the United States this time next year, there isn’t the slightest chance that Biden would recall it with such clarity. As Special Counsel Robert Hur noted in his report on Biden’s mishandling of classified documents: He did not remember when he was vice president, forgetting on the first day of the interview when his term ended (“if it was 2013 – when did I stop being Vice President?”), and forgetting on the second day of the interview when his term began (“in 2009, am I still Vice President?”). He did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died. And his memory appeared hazy when describing the Afghanistan debate that was once so important to him. This is where things get scary. Biden barely remembers major events in his political career and personal life, yet easily recalls things that never occurred. On January 30, for example, when asked if he would use his executive authority to ameliorate the immigration crisis, he responded thus : “I’ve done all I can do. Just give me the power. I’ve asked from the very day I got into office. Give me the Border Patrol.” In reality, of course, Biden hasn’t asked for this power because he already possesses it. He can solve the crisis by reversing some of his own executive orders and allowing the Border Patrol to do its job. Yet, when he shouted the above-quoted answer over the din of Marine One, he clearly believed his own words. (READ MORE from David Catron: Non-Citizens Have Been Voting Since 2008 ) Biden has always been a man of imperfect honesty, but the increasing volume and implausibility of his “lies” suggests that he can no longer differentiate between fact and fiction. Last year, for example, Biden said he visited Ground Zero the day after 9/11 : “I remember standing there the next day and looking at the building. I felt like I was looking through the gates of hell.” Even CNN called him out on that one. This isn’t like fudging the facts on Bidenomics. Is Biden’s cognitive state such that he “remembers” being at Ground Zero on 9/12? We don’t know because the White House has ignored the concerns of Congress, including those of former White House physician Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas): This is the fifth time we’ve sent a letter to the White House demanding Biden take a cognitive exam, however, while the administration has chosen to ignore each of these requests … As the former physician to three United States Presidents, extending over fourteen years, I know what it takes, mentally and physically, to be President. It is an extremely demanding job and being anything but top shape puts our country and American lives at risk. Indeed it does, but the White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress are obviously more concerned about remaining in power than in the well-being of Americans in general or the country as a whole. Consequently, instead of expressing relief when Special Counsel Robert Hur decided not to prosecute Biden for “willfully” retaining and illegally “disclosing” classified materials over a period of several years, they were outraged that he pointed out the “significant limitations” of his memory. But this is hardly news to the public. According to the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll , “86 percent of Americans think Biden, 81, is too old to serve another term as president.” The only real surprise was that ABC didn’t bury the poll. (READ MORE: Biden’s Sound and Fury ) This brings us back to Mark Twain. In today’s degraded education system, it’s unlikely that many people know he published the Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant . Grant had a very low opinion of journalists because of the slanderous treatment he received at their hands. Twain famously said, “Advertisements contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper.” Grant, a Republican, was once considered one of our worst presidents. Yet he has been steadily climbing in the rankings. Meanwhile, once revered presidents like Democrat Andrew Jackson have been heading south. Once today’s journalists finally die off, objective historians the age of my grandchildren will marvel that a cipher like Biden ever occupied the Oval Office.

"1","Maybe you’ve heard of Heidi Przybyla. Maybe you haven’t. She’s a reporter at Politico who the leftists at NBC News, who put her on MSNBC all the time, simply love. Przybyla was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize , which is a nice honor for her, owing to her participation in the leaking of the draft Supreme Court opinion in the Dobbs case. I can sum Przybyla up in one acronym. She’s an AWFL — an affluent white female leftist — and she conforms almost completely to type with respect to opinions, tone, mannerisms, and attitudes. There isn’t a great deal of individuality among AWFLs, particularly those who work in media. They know everything, even the things they clearly don’t know, and they’re happy to tell you all about it even when it’s clear the ignorance shines more brightly than those pearly whites on camera. And on Friday, Przybyla was on MSNBC, as usual, holding forth about “Christian nationalists,” which is the Left’s new bogeyman. Except it didn’t really go so well: pic.twitter.com/7j1agmBcsq — Heidi Przybyla 🌺 (@HeidiReports) February 23, 2024 Przybyla got her nose very out of joint when the 21 seconds of her explaining that the “Christian nationalist” groups surrounding Donald Trump all believe that our rights come from God rather than man were clipped out and shared around the internet, which presented her and the class of people she represents as antagonists to both Christians and the writers of the Declaration of Independence. She had the second sentence of the Declaration repeatedly thrown in her face amid a colossal ratio on Xwitter. You know, the thing?: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Przybyla protests that she’s being taken out of context in this 21-second clip. The problem is that the full two-minute conversation doesn’t help her cause. Her trouble starts — but doesn’t end — with the formulation of “Christian nationalist” in the first place, something that Przybyla is parroting from whatever leftist narrative factory (Anita Dunn’s SDK Knickerbocker?) has prepackaged. Which is that “Christian nationalism” is of a piece with the “white supremacism” that Team Obama and its offshoot, Team Biden, have been attempting to convince the nation is the No. 1 terrorist threat facing the country. There is nothing novel or even threatening about “Christian nationalism,” and there never has been. It’s been here from the very beginning of America — settled, as this land was, by Christians (and Jews, who come from the same tradition of values and moral laws) from Europe who sought a better society than was offered by the corrupt nations from which they came. America was founded as a Christian nation. Some 29 seminary students signed the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Jefferson, held up by the “separation of church and state” crowd as a hero for his much-misunderstood Danbury Church letters, oversaw Sunday church services in the U.S. Capitol building — which should tell you something the atheists and anti-religious folks don’t want you to know about his ideas on public-sector secularism. Our culture, our values, our economics, and our politics are based on Christianity, or at least Judeo- Christianity. As John Adams wrote in a 1798 letter to the men of the Massachusetts militia: Because We have no Government armed with Power capable of contending with human Passions unbridled by … morality and Religion. Avarice, Ambition … Revenge or Galantry, would break the strongest Cords of our Constitution as a Whale goes through a Net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. Emphasis mine, though I’m sure that if Adams had a “bold” key back then he would have employed it in the same place. To be a Christian nationalist is merely to take seriously the writings and statements of the men who founded this country, the greatest nation in the history of the world. And while Przybyla and the rest of the too-cool-for-church-school set are quite unnerved that they would be called out for anti-Christian bigotry, they’re just as opposed to “Christian” as they are “nationalist.” That’s as clear from the two-minute version of the clip as it is from the 21-second version. Because while she implies that the “rights come from God” part isn’t problematic in itself but in its use to make policy, her argument falls apart completely. Yes, as she argues, Martin Luther King Jr. successfully used the arguments of the Declaration to advance the cause of civil rights and his vision of a colorblind society. Except the modern Left, those who are attacking Christian nationalists as a threat to “our democracy,” don’t believe in King’s vision of a colorblind America. They’re the people pushing critical race theory and DEI in order to discriminate against Americans of European and East Asian stock in college admissions, the workplace, and elsewhere. But the absurdity only gets worse from there. For example, Przybyla acts as though pro-life Christians making laws limiting abortions in places where they’re a majority are “extreme.” Let’s remember that every major Christian denomination anyone takes seriously has voiced opposition to abortion and, in particular, to the unlimited abortion-on-demand such as that favored by today’s modern Democrat Party. Polling indicates that only one in six Americans — a true fringe if ever there were one — are for unlimited abortion. As for the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling on embryos , which the Left has used as a weapon to paint conservatives as extreme, that state’s Legislature is pushing legislation limiting the effect of that ruling, and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, whom Przybyla’s MSNBC friends and others can’t stop tarring with the “Christian nationalist” label, came out publicly in support of the legislators. Speaker Mike Johnson puts out a statement in support of IVF treatment: pic.twitter.com/41NV9kDCX0 — Andrew Solender (@AndrewSolender) February 24, 2024 That statement was attacked by the Left, which alleges that Johnson’s support for a personhood bill they say would essentially codify the Alabama Supreme Court ruling makes him a liar. Naturally you aren’t allowed to hold Democrat politicians to such standards because of the comic results that would yield. You also aren’t supposed to be a nationalist of any kind in America — because, according to them, this is a nation founded on racism and slavery and the theft of the Native Americans’ land, et cetera ad absurdum. There are couple of things to understand in context here. First, Przybyla is forwarding a worldview very similar to that offered by the Obama Justice Department in the Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor cases, both of which it lost. Namely, that while we have freedom of religion in this country, that freedom in practice doesn’t mean much more than your right to go to church. But it doesn’t extend to you attempting to live out that faith in your commercial activities — as in, your religious opposition to abortion doesn’t save you from purchasing Obamacare-mandated health insurance that includes abortion pills — when the government makes rules discriminating against your viewpoint. That’s a view of religious freedom that has made appearances in various places around the world over the past century and change. Perhaps the most prominent was in the Soviet Union’s constitution. And yes, the attitude toward Christians here is indistinct from that of the commissars. Secondly, regular readers will know that I’m a broken record in reciting my Gramsci to explain the modern Left, because it’s crucial to recognize that the dead Italian communist is the wellspring for everything you see from these people. Gramsci explained the failure of the Marxist proletarian revolution to materialize after World War I in the Western countries as resulting from three things: Christianity, nationalism, and charity. And that breaking the three was the key to the revolution. Gramsci is known for his formulation of the “long march through the institutions,” by which the communists would achieve hegemony over a society and then effect a “fundamental transformation” upon it. But the aim of the long march was to destroy Christianity, nationalism, and charity. Here we are 100 years later, and Heidi Przybyla is trashing Christian nationalists for standing up for the traditional worldview that held hegemony in this country as late as a generation ago. It’s really something to see. Antonio Gramsci would be quite proud of Heidi Przybyla. So would lots of other dead communists — and live ones, too. But for the rest of us, who found ourselves slurred for believing that our rights come from God and that public policy ought to reflect that belief, apparently we’re all Christian nationalists now. And if that’s who we are, then fine. We’ll be proud Christian nationalists, and we’ll wonder why we have to listen to lectures from commie wreckers like Heidi Przybyla and her MSNBC and Politico pals."
"1","A t last, the news we were waiting for! The headline in the Washington Post reads: “ White House reverses West Bank policy, calling Israeli settlements illegal .” Like the border, like inflation, like Russia, when President Joe Biden entered office in 2021, the Middle East was quiet. Biden made a great show on entering office of destroying any policy identified with Trump, regardless of the consequences for the country. And, so, we have the marked improvements on the border, inflation, and Russia for which these Biden years are so noted. When it comes to brilliant improvement, let’s not forget the Middle East as well. Here, too, genius was at work. Biden immediately resumed funding the U.N. and the UNRWA, whose employees were seen only recently in October furthering the aims of peace by carrying bodies of murdered Israelis to Gaza to hold for ransom and other such acts of high civilization. This on top of their other actions for which Biden with a keenly critical sense at last has rewarded them: teaching to a new generation hatred of Jews (that’s no doubt fine as the Jews are chosen people for special low status in the intersectionality hierarchy) and using their schools for stockpiling weapons and as rocket launching sites against Israel (perhaps those are the rockets Hamas regularly sends out first to gently warn Israeli civilians to get to their safe place). Another act of high statesmanship in this region was his immediately taking the Houthis off the terrorist list , which immediately brought the Houthis forth as agents of peace. As a result, they are today active agents for peace, stopping capitalist/imperialist ships from traversing the seas. And let us not forget the immortal strategic retreat in Afghanistan, which, in seeming to be an utter disaster, made America humble and loveable again to the Taliban and every other former enemy in the region, lifting our prestige immensely and furthering the cause of peace. But one thing was lacking. Perhaps because of the natural caution that so distinguishes a true statesman, Secretary of State Antony Blinken did not announce an immediate change in overall policy about Israel, along with the other improvements we have noted. But the horrible mess that the Pompeo doctrine had wrought cried out for rectification. After all, by recognizing Israel’s right to the Golan Heights and repudiating the idea that the West Bank territories, land that never been recognized as belonging to any country since the British mandate, should be free of Jews — why, that was a disgrace! And the peace that resulted from it, in which five Muslim nations signed treaties with Israel — what could have been more disgraceful than that? It contradicted the cherished principle that the key to peace lay in the hands of the Palestinians, who unilaterally could determine what conditions could lead to the end of the war they began in the 1920s and have continued to this day. Yet, with greatest self-control, and in the interest of a sane continuity, Blinken held back until the most opportune moment when his actions could be most meaningful. And history has been kind — what better way to use American clarity and the powerful arm of our diplomacy then to crown the efforts of the freedom fighters who massacred, raped, and kidnapped their way through Israel on Oct. 7 than by using the aftermath of their redemptive orgiastic spree to declare the act of Jews settling in their ancient homeland as criminal? For the creed of the woke states that apartheid is only wrong when committed by the wrong people. How glorious it would be to add the West Bank to the long list of Middle Eastern lands at last free of Jews! America might at last atone for its sins of promoting and defending a democratic state in which everyone’s freedom of religion is protected, and all have full political rights. At last, we reward the onslaught of people whose higher position in Holy Intersectionality makes them always right. At last, continuity has been established with the transformative policies of Obama, who saved Iran from the peril its nuclear program was in, who graciously helped ISIS realize ancient aspirations, and whose last act of farsighted foreign policy at the end of December 2016 was to guarantee passage of a Security Council resolution recognizing that Judaism’s most holy site, the Temple Mount, was exclusively Islamic property, and that Israel’s stewardship of that area so that both Jews and Muslims had full access was nothing short of criminal. Now we can relax. Surely, expelling Jews is the way to go to attain peace. This will clearly be seen positively by all the partners for peace in the region, who have long acknowledged that this policy should be established, as the catchy phrase goes, “from the river to the sea.” It has been far too long that American policy was run on a practical results basis, so clearly an oppressor construct. Our institutions of higher education have led the way, showing that correct narrative and correct ideology are the only things that matter to achieve the utopia we dream of. Now Blinken has at last brought correct ideology and the proper narrative back to where it belongs. No doubt, this will be among the crowning achievements of an administration noted for success in all it does."
"1","Nikki Haley doesn’t get it. The majority of Republicans love former President Donald Trump. My own time this last week at the annual CPAC gathering made it crystal clear that the thousands of conservatives in attendance were not just supporting Trump — they were enthusiastically supporting Trump. And that was before the South Carolina primary, where Haley, former governor of the state, was soundly defeated by Trump in her own backyard. Not to mention that Trump has won every primary he has entered — and she has lost every primary she has entered. Then there were the humiliating results out of Nevada, as reported in Politico: Worse than you can imagine: Haley loses to ‘none of these candidates’ in Nevada The defeat, while symbolic, was a major embarrassment for the former South Carolina governor. One would think that a rational, observant person would realize her campaign is going nowhere and gracefully withdraw and support the winner. That was exactly what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis did, and one can be sure that in four years he will be able to try again. Which, one suspects, is exactly what he has in mind. But not Haley. Worse for her still, Haley has made crystal clear that her primary goal in running is to appease the failing old Washington Establishment. As Haley repeatedly says of Trump , as recently in Michigan: The problem is chaos literally follows him. We can’t be a country in disarray, in a world on fire, and go through four more years of chaos, we won’t survive. Which is shorthand for her devotion to the same old, same old. The very last thing Washington needs is a president who goes out of his or her way to appease the denizens of the Swamp with the mantra that things have always been done this way and that to bring serious change is “chaos.” Which is exactly what Haley is doing. It is exactly Trump’s view that Washington must be seriously reworked. There is, to cite but one example, no excuse for a massive federal bureaucracy where the employees, once in, have a lifetime job. They need to be term limited, with real and constant turnover to bring in new blood and fresh thinking to run the government. Only if one thinks like the Swamp — which is precisely the way Haley thinks — would rethinking how the government operates and doing something about it be seen as “chaos.” And right there is exactly the reason Haley’s campaign has been a “no sale” with Republican voters. The voters want serious change; Haley campaigns on a promise of more of the same. She has also gone after Trump for demanding that America’s NATO allies pay their NATO bills. Haley is apparently clueless that one of the founding fathers of NATO — Gen. and later President Dwight Eisenhower — had exactly the same view of NATO allies as does Trump. As previously noted in this space , Eisenhower biographer historian Stephen Ambrose reported this in his two-volume Eisenhower biography: When [Gen.] Gruenther passed along some more European criticism, Eisenhower began to lose his temper. “I get weary of the European habit of taking our money,” the President wrote, “resenting any slight hint as to what they should do, and then assuming, in addition, full right to criticize us as bitterly as they may desire. In fact, it sometimes appears that their indulgence in this kind of criticism varies in direct ratio to the amount of help we give them.” In fact, the whole thing made him mad as hell, and “makes me wonder whether the Europeans are as grown up and mature as they try to make it appear.” Apparently Nikki Haley would have disagreed with not only President Trump but President Eisenhower as well. Telling. The long ago 1960s Speaker of the California Legislature, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan’s opposite number and boss of the California Democratic Party, Jesse Unruh, famously observed that “money is the mother’s milk of politics.” Indeed, it is. This week’s news brings this headline: Conservative megadonors Koch not funding Haley anymore as she continues longshot bid Which is to say that Haley’s “mother’s milk” is starting to evaporate. Taken altogether, it is now crystal clear that Nikki Haley and her campaign are fading into irrelevance. One of the very first tasks of a successful presidential campaign is to prove the candidate’s viability. And every day that Haley continues her campaign the realization that she simply is not viable increases. A realization underlined by her 20-point rejection in her own home state. The best thing she could do now? Follow the DeSantis model — gracefully withdraw and endorse President Donald Trump. Will she do it? One suspects not. Instead, she is choosing to campaign against the millions of Trump-supporting conservatives who make up the GOP electorate. Indeed, she appears to want to go out of her way to irritate or anger them. Which, in turn, is winding up as the self-immolation of a once-promising political career as Nikki Haley fades to irrelevance."
"2","As BookTok goes, so goes publishing. The community of TikTokers who make videos about their favorite books is one of the only forces actively driving book sales in a contracting market — and right now, BookTok has a new favorite genre. Romantasy , the hybrid genre of romance-focused fantasy novels, has never been hotter. Every second pitch I receive from a publisher describes itself as romantasy. Bookstores are pushing tables of romantasy novels to the front of the shop. Grown-ups and teenagers alike are posting long videos about their favorite romantasy books. Many of them highlight Sarah J. Maas, the genre’s reigning queen. Maas has been publishing since 2012, when at 26 she published Throne of Glass , the fantasy novel she started working on as a 16-year-old. In 2013, she scored her first New York Times bestseller , and in 2015, she began to pick up adult fans with the wildly popular A Court of Thorns and Roses . Now, Maas has two YA and one adult romantasy series ( Crescent City , the adult series, began in 2020). Between all those titles, she’s sold more than 38 million books worldwide . Her most recent book, House of Flame and Shadow , came out at the end of January and has been on the bestseller list ever since . Of all Maas’s series, A Court of Thorns and Roses (ACOTAR) is her crown jewel. The TikTok tag #acotar has 8.9 billion views. Hulu has been developing a TV adaptation helmed by Ron Moore, although its current status is reportedly “ murky .” Among fans, it is her most beloved work, the only Maas series so popular that it’s spawned its own spinoff novels. They say that ACOTAR has reignited their childhood love of reading, that these are the books that make other books feel worthwhile. Reading through the first three volumes of ACOTAR recently, I began to understand why. These books go down like candy, silly and frothy and compulsively readable. Everyone in ACOTAR is beautiful, everyone is attractively damaged, everyone is pining with love for some inaccessible someone else. I read nearly 2,000 pages in a couple of weeks. What is liveliest about Maas’s writing, though, is how well she knows her formula. Maas is a genius at cramming her books with the tropes of her hybrid genre — and then subverting those tropes just enough to thrill. In his 2017 book Hit Makers , journalist Derek Thompson identifies a simple formula for popularity. Human beings, Thompson writes, tend to like things that are pleasingly familiar, with a gentle touch of surprise. That’s part of why romantasy is so popular. It takes two familiar trope-driven formulae — say, an enemies-to-lovers love story plus an epic battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil — and smashes them together to create something that feels new. Identifying the pleasingly familiar and adding a surprise is something of a specialty for Maas. She likes to start her stories with classic fairy tales given a hint of a girl power twist. Throne of Glass is based on “Cinderella,” but Maas’s Cinderella is an assassin sent to kill the prince. A Court of Thorns and Roses is “Beauty and the Beast,” but Beauty is a deadly huntress. Within the stories themselves, Maas’s worldbuilding is full of hat tips to her predecessors. In A Court of Thorn and Roses , the faerie land is called Prythian, a nod to Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain . In Prythian, faeries use a form of teleportation called “winnowing,” and their explanation of it will be familiar to anyone who loved Madeleine L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time . “Think of it as … two different points on a piece of cloth,” Maas writes (very much her ellipses). “Winnowing … it’s like folding that cloth so the two spots align.” If you’ve read the classics of YA fantasy before, you’ll recognize the sampling and remixing she is doing here. Part of the pleasure of reading Maas is seeing these familiar YA fantasy references lie cheek by jowl with the tropes of romance novels. In A Court of Mist and Fury , the second volume of the series, two lovers who have not yet admitted their feelings for each other find themselves forced by cruel circumstance to fake date . Later, they end up at an inn with only one bed to spare, not once but twice. Across ACOTAR, Maas’s protagonist, Feyre, is torn between two boys. One is blond and sunny; one is dark-haired and brooding; both are impossibly beautiful, rich, and powerful; both begin as Feyre’s enemies. Romance and fantasy also have their darker tropes, and Maas plays with these as well. Lots of books feature villainous sexual predators, but when such figures appear in ACOTAR, they are almost exclusively women. It’s an interestingly consistent move from Maas — one she appears to keep coming back to across her books because it feels counterintuitive while at the same time allowing her readers the satisfaction of a purely evil villainess to hate. It’s also a good excuse to give her male characters extra layers of sadness and vulnerability. Maas is not interested in dissecting all the ways sexual trauma can hurt a person, but she is interested in giving her romantic leads dark and violent backstories. Maas’s biggest subversion, though, is also her most exciting. At the end of A Court of Thorns and Roses , she pulls out the rug from under her own love triangle, and the results are glee-inducing to read. Spoilers follow. If the first volume of ACOTAR is a Beauty and the Beast story, then the Beast is Tamlin, the mercurial faerie lord who first pulls Feyre into Prythian. Tamlin, the High Lord of Spring, is angry and possessive in the way that tends to read as attractive in romance novels, especially romance novels based on this fairy tale. Tamlin has the ability to turn into a wolflike creature, and when he’s angry, he growls and claws shoot out of his fingers. When Feyre gets angry, he uses magic to restrain her. None of Tamlin’s sins here are too far off the Edward Cullen norm, and with the first three-quarters of Thorns and Roses following the beats of a standard Beauty and the Beast love story so clearly, it’s easy to feel as though Maas is steering you toward thinking of Tamlin’s anger problem as romantic. Feyre, who is recovering from a childhood of poverty and emotional neglect, falls rapidly for Tamlin, despite her initial hatred of all faeries. He showers her with fine food and clothes, gives her art supplies so that she can pursue her passion for painting. He is the first person Feyre has ever encountered who treats her as someone special and beautiful. His uncontrollable rage at the thought of her being in danger or with another man seems to her like yet more proof that she is special and beautiful. She is smitten. When the book ends with the pair kissing in a meadow full of wildflowers, it feels like just what you would expect. Yet something bizarre happens about a hundred pages before that ending. Tamlin is kidnapped by a wicked faerie, and Feyre has to go on a quest to rescue him. That quest is normal for this story type — Beauty traditionally rescues the Beast, and Tamlin’s name is a nod to the Scottish ballad of Tam Lin, in which a mortal girl rescues her lover from a wicked fairy queen. Done right, such a quest reads as incredibly romantic, a chance for the lovers to prove the strength of their connection against insurmountable odds. What’s so odd about this particular case is that instead, as soon as the quest begins, Tamlin becomes a nonentity within the story. Feyre’s thoughts of Tamlin and how much she loves him become generic, vague on the details. Even when he is present on the page, he is passive, unemotive, no longer compelling. All the energy and the juice of the story has transferred itself over to a new romantic lead — Rhysand, the enigmatic and brooding High Lord of Night. In Thorns and Roses , Rhysand is ambiguously villainous, apparently allied with the wicked queen. Still, for purposes of his own, he’s willing to form an alliance with Feyre to help her rescue Tamlin. In the page time that earlier in the novel would have been accorded to Tamlin, Feyre thinks a lot about how much she hates Rhysand, and also how attractive he is. It doesn’t take a genius to see that Feyre is going to hook up with Rhys eventually, but the structure of the tropes here tells us that Tamlin is obviously Feyre’s endgame. He’s the Beast and she’s the Beauty! They end the book kissing in a meadow! Who’s going to mess with that? Maas messes with it. With a merciless speed that I can only compare to Gilmore Girls making Dean illiterate as soon as Jess shows up, Maas reveals in the opening of A Court of Mist and Fury that Tamlin is a faerie Republican, ruling his court according to the laws of trickle-down magic economics and sparing no handouts for the poor. Feyre, with her background of childhood poverty, is outraged — and as Tamlin’s possessive rages become more and more violent, she loses patience with him. Before the end of the book, she has cast Tamlin aside and declared her love for Rhysand, who is revealed to be the most benevolent of all the High Lords of Prythian and who places a premium on Feyre’s independence to boot. This kind of love interest switcheroo is common in the world of teen TV, where characters change partners according to the fickle winds of cast chemistry and writing staff changes . In YA books, however, love stories tend to be more aesthetically unified than they are on TV. You can usually tell who will end up with whom from early on in the narrative, and the satisfaction of reading comes from seeing how they’ll end up together. Watching a swap like this one emerge out of nowhere is a perfect execution of Thompson’s Hit Makers formula: a pleasingly familiar romance trope subverted when you least expect it; the love story structure of one medium ported over into another. It’s popular among Maas’s fans to say that the switch is a politically evolved take on the problems of the Beauty and the Beast story. The Beast’s anger issues and violent tendencies, his decision to find a girlfriend by kidnapping her — these are revealed as red flags for an abusive relationship instead of romantic quirks. Feyre finds true love not with him but with someone who tells her constantly that she is always free to make her own choices. I’m not sure, though, that the switch works as an effective political critique on Maas’s source material. Rhys, like Tamlin, initiates his relationship with Feyre by coercing her into a magical bargain that forces her to promise to come to his home. Like Tamlin, Rhys mistreats Feyre only to later reveal he was forced to do so by circumstances beyond his control. He withholds crucial information from her, and although he lets her make her own choices, he forces her to do so within artificially limited circumstances. The switch is incredibly fun to read, yet it doesn’t criticize problematic old romance tropes so much as slightly tweak their angles. But then, if those romance tropes weren’t so satisfying to read, problematic or not, Maas wouldn’t have used them to begin with. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Arab American activists and their allies are urging voters to cast ballots as “uncommitted” in Michigan’s Democratic primary on Tuesday in protest of President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza . They’re unlikely to change the result of the contest, in which Biden is the only major candidate, but they’re hoping to signal their anger — and send a warning — to Democrats in one of the most critical swing states on the 2024 map. Michigan is home to more than 300,000 people who claim Middle Eastern or North African heritage , many of them concentrated in the city of Dearborn — one of the largest Arab American communities in the US. These are voters who helped deliver Michigan to Biden in 2020, when his margin of victory in the state was just over 154,000 votes . In Wayne County, where Dearborn is located, as well as Oakland County, where Arab Americans also make up a significant share of the population, voters backed him at rates of about 69 and 56 percent, respectively. Those days, however, are over. Biden is currently losing to former President Donald Trump in seven major polls conducted in Michigan since the beginning of the war. There are multiple reasons for that, including falling support in the powerful auto workers union , which endorsed Biden glaringly late in the game this year, but Arab Americans and young progressive voters in the state have also cited Gaza as an important factor, and most Michiganders support a ceasefire . Arab American officials in Michigan have become prominent critics of the US’s support for Israel’s campaign, which has killed about 30,000 Palestinians since the October 7 attack by Hamas . The mayor of Dearborn — Abdullah Hammoud, who has Lebanese ancestry — wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times Wednesday that “We don’t have to imagine the violence and injustice being carried out against the Palestinian people. Many of us lived it, and still bear the scars of life under occupation and apartheid.” US Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan), the only Palestinian member of Congress , has explicitly told voters not to support Biden. NEW ENDORSEMENT: “If you want us to be louder, come here and vote uncommitted.” - @RashidaTlaib pic.twitter.com/8pxuUjq5QG — #ListenToMichigan (@Listen2michigan) February 17, 2024 Tlaib’s sister, Layla Elabed, is now heading up the “Listen to Michigan” campaign to encourage at least 10,000 Michiganders to vote “uncommitted” in support of a ceasefire in Gaza. Now endorsed by progressive organizations including Our Revolution and the Democratic Socialists of America , the campaign has been conducting text and phone banking, buying digital ads, knocking on doors, and sending out mailers throughout Michigan. “This is a protest vote against genocide,” Elabed said. “The resounding sense in a lot of Arab American communities and Muslim American communities is that our voices don’t matter here. And our lives don’t matter abroad.” Even if the organizers of the uncommitted campaign succeed, they won’t affect Biden’s chances of securing his party’s nomination. But depending on how large the uncommitted vote is in Michigan, it could spell trouble for Biden in the fall, should Arab Americans and their allies stay home or cast a ballot for Trump in a state Biden, currently in a tight contest nationally , will likely need to win. Biden has faltered on Arab American outreach The uncommitted campaign is the product of what Arab American leaders say is the White House’s failure to listen to them and address their concerns through traditional outreach channels. Since October, Arab American leaders have been trying to no avail to get an audience with Biden to voice their concerns about the war, said Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute, who grew up in Dearborn. Biden quietly hosted a group of five Muslim leaders in late October at the White House, where they told him that he had failed to show empathy for the acute suffering in Gaza. But that was seen as a slight by the ethnic constituency of Arab Americans, who are also Christian, Druze, Jewish, Mandaen, and other faiths, as well as secular, Berry said. And in February, Biden skipped a scheduled stop in Dearborn while visiting Michigan, instead meeting with auto workers in the Detroit metro area. “For months, we’ve been asking for meaningful engagement on policy, and, frankly, are being ignored,” Berry said. The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee did not respond to requests for comment. Officials from the Biden campaign and the White House, as well as Biden surrogates, have visited Michigan multiple times in the last two months with the intent of smoothing things over with the Arab American community. In January, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez held small meetings with some Arab American leaders after others made clear that they were too angry to be open to dialogue in a planned larger meeting. And even after adjusting the plan, there was one meeting in which all 10 to 15 people invited declined to attend in protest. To Elabed, the fact that Biden sent his campaign manager to Michigan signaled that he was more interested in securing Arab American votes than talking “about how this failed policy is affecting our communities,” she said. In February, a group of White House officials, including USAID administrator Samantha Power, also visited Michigan to highlight how the administration is trying to get humanitarian aid to Palestinians. In a closed-door meeting, deputy national security adviser Jon Finer reportedly admitted that the administration had “misstepped in the course of responding to this crisis” and “left a very damaging impression, based on what has been a wholly inadequate public accounting for how much the president, the administration, the country values the lives of Palestinians.” Biden ally Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) — who supports a ceasefire in Gaza and cutting off further aid to Israel — met with Arab and Muslim leaders in Michigan earlier this month to talk about how to build support for their policy demands in Washington. But Elabed said it still doesn’t feel as though Biden is adequately responding to the concerns of the Arab American community. His sharpest critique of Israel’s campaign came only earlier this month, when he said that it was “over the top” and that civilian suffering and death “had to stop.” Meanwhile, the US recently vetoed a ceasefire resolution at the United Nations for the third time since the start of the war. The Biden administration continues to push for a $14.1 billion supplemental aid package for Israel on top of the approximately $3.3 billion it already receives annually from the US, and is continuing to make major arms sales while offering unconditional military support to Israel. “For Joe Biden to ignore the very communities that largely brought him Michigan in 2020 is a slap in the face,” Elabed said. “It does feel so dehumanizing that a party that I have supported my whole adult life is now ignoring the deaths and murder of my people and the destruction of my ancestral land.” Arab Americans say blame Biden if Trump wins a second term — not them Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is urging voters in her state not to vote uncommitted. “It’s important not to lose sight of the fact that any vote that’s not cast for Joe Biden supports a second Trump term,” she said on Sunday during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union . But many Arab American activists are arguing that Whitmer and others critiquing uncommitted voters should instead lay the blame at Biden’s feet. “If the outcome is that we have another Trump presidency, it is going to be Joe Biden and his administration and the Democratic Party that hands over the White House to the Trump administration,” Elabed said. “Because when you ignore your core constituency ... you have no one to blame but yourselves.” Many Arab American voters fear a second Trump presidency — not just on the issue of Gaza — and acknowledge that his foreign policy was disastrous for Palestinians and the Arab world, Berry said. He moved the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2017 — a choice made in recognition of the fact that Israel had made unified Jerusalem its capital but a decidedly controversial one given that control of Jerusalem has historically been a key sticking point in negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. The US recognized the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights under Trump and reaffirmed it under Biden. The Trump administration also argued in 2019 that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are not necessarily illegal , lending legitimacy to Israel’s claims on the territories, but the annexations and moves toward it are widely regarded as illegal under international law, and no other country has recognized them. Trump also instituted a travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries — including the Arab states of Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — that was struck down by the courts and later revived in a different iteration . None of this is news to Arab American voters. But activists argue it’s still hard for them to justify voting for Biden when the Biden administration has in their minds failed to adequately push back on the slaughter of Palestinians after October 7. “We fought back for those four years,” Abed Ayoub, national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said. “We pushed back and we found ways to fight back against [Trump’s] policies. But the one thing we didn’t have was a genocide.” Berry said her organization is pushing hard to ensure that Arab Americans don’t just sit this election out as a result of anger with Biden, which she said is not how the community’s best interests are served, but isn’t encouraging that they vote any particular way. The alternatives include voting for third-party candidates or casting a ballot for Trump. Many Iraqi Chaldean Christians in Michigan’s Macomb and Oakland counties already backed him in 2020, when he promised to shield them from deportation . “We’ll speak to [Trump]. And if he does the right moves in the campaign ... we don’t mind voting for him,” Ayoub said. “Those dead family members, those dead bodies, those images we’re seeing ... That’s enough for them to say, give me a few bad tweets and a few mean words and let my family members live.” What does all of this really mean, in Michigan and nationally? The national contest between Biden and Trump, who is all but assured the GOP nomination, is tight. As one of six major battleground states in 2024, Michigan could determine the outcome of the election overall, and Biden can’t afford any significant splintering of his coalition there. The Arab American community in Michigan is small, making up slightly over 1 percent of the state’s population of 10 million. And outside the Arab American community, there are “not that many” voters who disagree with Biden’s policies in Gaza and even fewer are “so motivated in their anger against Biden that they would vote uncommitted in a Democratic primary,” Bill Ballenger, a longtime political pundit in Michigan, said. But if the margins in Michigan are anywhere as close as they were in 2020 and 2016, “maybe the loss of support in the Arab American community could spell the difference between victory and defeat for Biden,” Ballenger said. “No wonder he’s worried.” And while the war in Gaza looms large in Michigan because of its large Arab American community, it’s an issue that has resonated nationally among Arab Americans, who also have sizable and growing communities in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Georgia. The movement to abandon Biden over his stance on Gaza has already spread to some of those states , and his campaign is struggling to secure surrogates and endorsements that could help bridge the gap with Arab Americans and young progressives. Nationally, Biden’s support among Arab American voters has fallen from 59 in 2020 to 17 percent after the war in Gaza broke out in October. Democrats generally have also increasingly turned against the war in Gaza. About half of 2020 Biden voters said that they believe Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in a February poll by YouGov/The Economist. That doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ll decide how to vote based on Biden’s response to the war; the economy remains a bipartisan priority for voters , and Democrats also cite health care , climate change , poverty, racism, abortion , and women’s rights as top concerns. Biden is pushing the progress he’s made on the economy and trying to draw a sharp contrast with Trump on these other issues so far. But the number of uncommitted voters in Michigan could signal just how deep Democratic discontent is. “This is not only isolated to Arab or Muslim voters in Michigan,” Aboud said.

"2","America’s colleges and universities are embroiled in yet another debate about admissions. This time, they’re rethinking their positions on standardized testing. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, several elite colleges made the submission of SAT and ACT scores optional for applicants. Testing had become a hassle, with limited testing locations and time for students to get prepared. The anti-testing movement had long contended that standardized tests reinforce racial and economic inequality and that reliance on them harms students from disadvantaged backgrounds. During the pandemic, those students faced additional roadblocks. Schools loosened restrictions to simplify the process for everyone. But last week, Yale University announced that it was reversing course. Going forward, students must include test scores with their applications, and for the first time, the school is allowing applicants to report Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) exam scores in place of SAT or ACT scores. The move follows two others reinstating testing requirements of some kind: Dartmouth College earlier this month and MIT in 2022. So why are (a few elite) school leaders changing their minds? They’re pointing to new research that says that test scores are actually helpful for admissions decisions — and beneficial for marginalized students. Do standardized tests make school admissions more or less fair? The anti-testing movement has long held that tests maintain inequality and are a disservice to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. There are reasons for that: Tests can be discriminatory . A study from Opportunity Insights, a group of Harvard economists, found that “students from low-income families and other less advantaged backgrounds have lower standardized test scores and are less likely to take the test than students from higher income families” due to “differences in school quality, neighborhood exposure, and many other environmental conditions.” But that wasn’t their central finding. They and the other researchers fueling the recent admissions reversals have found that test-optional practices harm students from low-income backgrounds. vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page . Subscribe That’s because when given the option to submit scores, these students decided not to submit them out of fear that their scores weren’t perfect. Instead, admissions counselors have found that strong scores from students of lower-income backgrounds are an indicator that they would excel academically in college. What does the research say about how universities use test scores? One thing college admissions officers consider when evaluating a potential student is: Will they succeed here? And researchers have tried to determine the connection between test scores and that college success. In one study , Dartmouth researchers found that test scores were a better indicator of college performance than grades, essays, or teacher recommendations. And importantly, researchers found that test scores help admissions officers better pick out high-achieving less-advantaged applicants. Under the test-optional policy, “many high-achieving less-advantaged applicants choose not to submit scores even when doing so would allow Admissions to identify them as students likely to succeed at Dartmouth and in turn benefit their application,” the researchers wrote. The Opportunity Insights researchers similarly examined the connection between test scores and student success at IvyPlus institutions (the eight Ivy League colleges plus Stanford, MIT, Duke, and the University of Chicago). They found that “Even among otherwise similar students with the same high school grades, [...] SAT and ACT scores have substantial predictive power for academic success in college.” These researchers also found that higher high school GPAs are not associated with higher college GPAs. Yale’s research has identified the same thing. In its announcement, the school wrote, “test scores are the single greatest predictor of a student’s future Yale grades. This is true even after controlling for family income and other demographic variables, and it is true for subject-based exams such as AP and IB, in addition to the ACT and SAT.” In short, according to Opportunity Insights’ findings, it can be the case that tests reinforce inequality generally but also allow schools to identify individual kids who are academically prepared despite challenging circumstances. What happens next Yale and Dartmouth have emphasized that test scores are simply one part of their whole-person review processes. Using test scores in the years before the pandemic had not harmed Yale’s diversity efforts, the university said in its announcement, citing gains in the number of admitted first-generation college students and under- represented minority students. And it’s worth pointing out that some of the wealthiest applicants never stopped testing and submitting scores when possible. Adam Nguyen, who founded Ivy Link, a firm that helps students gain admission to selective colleges, never changed the advice he gave to clients. “I can tell you that a number of things on the application are ‘optional,’ but to get into the Ivy League and other elite colleges, an applicant has to go above and beyond the minimum requirements,” he said. And for wealthy students, that can mean paying firms like his tens of thousands of dollars to help curate outstanding extracurricular resumes, design showcase projects, and bolster their grades. Comparatively, he said, “standardized tests are probably the avenue where kids” can excel with fewer resources. Meanwhile, the anti- testing movement has said the attention to the test-optional reversals is excessive. An overwhelming majority of US colleges and universities remain test-optional. At least 1,825 four-year colleges in the US — or more than 80 percent of them — will not require SAT or ACT scores for fall 2025, according to FairTest, an organization that advocates against testing requirements. “Despite a media frenzy around a single Ivy League school reinstating testing requirements, ACT/SAT-optional and test-blind/score-free policies remain the new normal in undergraduate admissions,” said FairTest executive director Harry Feder.

"2","During the war in Gaza , President Joe Biden has taken a consistently pro- Israel line. He traveled to Israel after the October 7 attack , provided the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with huge quantities of munitions , refused to publicly call for an indefinite ceasefire , and vetoed UN resolutions it opposed . This all reflects the president’s strongly held personal beliefs on the need to support the Jewish state and the idea that public support for Israel gives America greater behind-the-scenes leverage. For those who wish Washington would put more pressure on Jerusalem to stop the killing, this raises a fundamental question: Would President Donald Trump have done anything differently? The answer is almost certainly yes. Biden has put only inconsistent pressure on Israel; Trump would have put none. Everything we know about the former president, from his extensive policy record on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict to his top advisers’ statements on the war, suggests he would have no qualms about aligning himself completely with Israel’s far-right government. While Biden has pushed Israel behind the scenes on issues like food and medical aid to civilians — with some limited success — it’s hard to imagine Trump even lifting a finger in defense of Gazan civilians whom he wants to ban from entering the United States . The Israeli right understands this and pines for Trump. In an early February interview with the Wall Street Journal, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir made his views quite clear. “Instead of giving us his full backing, Biden is busy with giving humanitarian aid and fuel [to Gaza], which goes to Hamas ,” Ben-Gvir said. “If Trump was in power, the U.S. conduct would be completely different.” Expert observers have a similar take. In a recent New Republic essay lambasting Biden’s Gaza policy , two former high-level officials — American David Rothkopf and Israeli Alon Pinkas — argue that the difference between him and Trump is still massive. “Whatever our critique of the Biden administration’s Israel-Gaza policy to date, the only hope of undoing recent mistakes and achieving positive results lies with maintaining America’s current leadership,” they argue. “Donald Trump, as we have both written elsewhere, would be many times worse, many times more accommodating to the extremist elements in Netanyahu ’s government.” This is not meant as a bank-shot defense of Biden. The current president should not be judged by the standards of his predecessor; there’s far more he could have done, and could still do, to help pull Israel’s government off its deadly and self-destructive path . But with one of these two men almost certain to be inaugurated next January, it’s worth being clear-eyed about their actual policy differences. And the truth is this: Biden is a traditional pro-Israel American centrist, while Trump has openly and publicly aligned himself with the Israeli right wing. Those are two very different worldviews that would yield very different policies . In fact, they already have. “The most pro-Israel president ever” Donald Trump loves deals — and an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement would be “the deal of the century,” as he’s fond of saying. Early in his administration , it seemed like that might cause him to climb down from the hardline pro-Israel positions he had outlined on the campaign trail. After all, you can’t get to a deal if you’re only talking to one side. But getting Palestinians to the table would have required a more even-handed policy than what Trump — the self-described most pro-Israel president ever — pursued. There is a reason Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu all-but-openly campaigned for Trump against Biden in 2020 . American policy in the Trump administration was a laundry list of gifts to the Israeli right: Drafting a “peace plan” with zero Palestinian input that would have, if implemented, actually ended the possibility for a real Palestinian state . Cutting Palestinians out of the negotiations over the so-called Abraham Accords, realizing the longstanding Israeli goal of severing diplomatic progress with Arab states from progress towards a sovereign Palestine. Recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights , disputed territory with Syria taken during the 1967 Six-Day War. Shutting off funding for the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (which Biden almost immediately restored and then temporarily suspended again amid a scandal about its employees participating in October 7 ). Abandoning the decades-old US position that West Bank settlements are a key barrier to a peace agreement and eliminating longstanding restrictions on spending US taxpayer dollars in them. Moving the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem while closing the US mission to Palestine in the same city . These are not “normal” positions, the sort you expect any president to take given the bipartisan pro-Israel consensus in American politics. Many of them were directly at odds with the longstanding bipartisan consensus in US policymaking, one which attempted to balance support for Israel with trying to maintain the US position as a potential mediator in credible peace talks. The Biden team has largely tried to return to this traditional position where it could, even as it worked to deprioritize Middle East diplomacy prior to October 7. This track record gives us suggests that Trump does not approach Israel like other issues. Neither his dealmaker bravado nor his transactional approach to other alliances like NATO tempered his hardline support for Netanyahu and the Israeli right while in office. To make the case that he would have handled the Gaza war differently, one would need to show some reason to believe Trump would break with his established pattern. And there isn’t one. Why Trump’s Gaza policy would (still) be more hawkish than Biden’s Trump’s Israel-Palestine policy, per accounts like this one from the Washington Post’s Isaac Stanley-Becker , was largely the product of delegation. Uninterested in the details, he outsourced policy formulation to aides. While Trump has said relatively little about the Gaza war since October 7, these influential aides have been quite vocal. And they have attacked Biden from the right. Chief among these deputies was son- in-law Jared Kushner. In a public appearance at Harvard in February, he expressed outright opposition to Biden’s current push for a Palestinian state as part of any postwar settlement. “Giving them a Palestinian state is basically a reinforcement of, ‘We’re going to reward you for bad actions,’” Kushner said. “You have to show terrorists that they will not be tolerated, that we will take strong action.” Trump’s ambassador to Israel, noted hardliner David Friedman, went even further — accusing the Biden team of “ hampering the war effort ” by pressuring Israel to limit the civilian casualty toll of its bombing campaign . “At no time [while I was ambassador] did the United States put any handcuffs or limitations on Israel’s ability to respond,” he added in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 news station. And Jason Greenblatt, Trump’s special envoy for Middle East policy, blasted the Biden administration's decision to impose sanctions on violent West Bank settlers as “wrong and deceptive.” He also claimed to be “shocked that the State Department was investigating the possibility of declaring an independent Palestinian state,” a decision he termed “terribly harmful and dangerous.” The key decision-makers in the last Trump administration have repudiated the handful of Biden decisions that peace advocates can actually approve of: his quiet pressure on Israel to limit harm to civilians, his diplomacy aimed at improving the postwar future, and his willingness to put sanctions on Israeli settlers. By contrast, Trump’s advisers have praised the elements of Biden’s policy that his left-wing critics most reject: the president’s public and full-throated support for the Israeli war effort. US President Joe Biden and Israeli President Isaac Herzog pose for a picture with children waving the American and Israeli flags upon his arrival to the presidential residence in Jerusalem on July 14, 2022. Maya Alleruzzo/Pool/AFP/Getty Images “While I have been, and remain, deeply critical of the Biden Administration, the moral, tactical, diplomatic and military support that it has provided Israel over the past few days has been exceptional,” Friedman wrote on October 12 . “As one living in Jerusalem with children who are Israeli citizens, I am deeply grateful. I pray that American support continues in the difficult days ahead.” There is no sign that Trump plans to pick a different kind of adviser or reject his previous positions. When Trump made one stray negative comment about Netanyahu in October, seemingly a product of sour grapes about the Israeli prime minister recognizing Biden’s 2020 victory, the former president walked back his criticism the next day . Again: Biden’s position over the course of this war is entirely fair game for criticism. Palestinians feel betrayed by him, as do many Arab and Muslim American voters, and it’s hard to fault them for that. Biden has, for example, built up a huge reservoir of goodwill among Israelis, to the point where he’s actually more popular there than both Trump and Netanyahu . Yet several experts have told me that he’s bafflingly unwilling to cash in this support, to tell Israelis the truth about their government’s horrific mismanagement of the war and to put pressure for a just and swift resolution. But it’s one thing to say Biden is falling short, and another thing entirely to say he’s not meaningfully different than Trump would have been. Every piece of evidence we have suggests he would be — and that this difference could matter a great deal to the future of America’s approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

"2","I wanted to start seeing a therapist long before I finally did. For many years, my biggest obstacle was a near-total lack of free time, then a lack of insurance coverage for mental health care, then a range of positions that made seeking mental health care a professional liability . Even once I finally had a job with decent benefits and a list of therapists recommended by trusted friends, it took months to overcome another big obstacle to picking up the phone: my fear that during my first conversation with a prospective provider, I’d end up crying on the phone to a stranger. I’m not alone. In scientific studies, people who’d benefit from mental health care give rich and varied reasons for not seeking it, among them thinking it’s unnecessary , fear others will think less of them for getting it, and cost . At the same time, the US mental health care system isn’t structured to make treatment broadly available: Last year, 160 million Americans lived in areas with provider shortages and insurance denials, and in 2021, only one-third of people diagnosed with a behavioral health condition got the care they needed. Recent efforts to strengthen laws aimed at improving access might eventually help, but it’s not going to happen overnight. If you’re considering getting care for your mental health needs, just getting started can feel daunting, and the landscape of payment, providers, and your progress can feel like a minefield. It’s especially hard to begin if you embark on this journey when you’re at a low point. I speak from experience: I did wind up having the teary conversation I’d dreaded. But it turned out to be more clarifying than mortifying, and the therapist on the other end of the line was a keeper. People face a range of common obstacles when seeking mental health care. Here’s how to navigate a few of them. I don’t know what diagnosis I have or what kind of treatment I need People across the spectrum of okayness access mental health care at different times in their lives, and there’s huge variation in what leads them to do so, says Megan Rochford , who oversees the National Alliance on Mental Illness’s (NAMI’s) national helpline . No matter your situation, keep in mind that you don’t need to know what you need to start getting care. If a sense of shame is keeping you from seeking mental health care, know that you’re not alone and help is out there, says Rochford. Calls to helplines like NAMI’s and the care that licensed professionals provide are confidential, she says, and their goal is to give you what you need to be your best and strongest self. Furthermore, getting mental health support might not look the way you imagine it: The vocabulary of modern mental health care goes beyond therapists’ couches and medications and includes options like community care models (including healing circles and peer support) that feel more welcoming for some people. Although the people you consult as you’re seeking care might be the experts on the resources available to you, you’re ultimately the expert on your own experience, and you get to decide what feels right for you, says Niya McCray-Brown , a licensed professional counselor who directs community engagement at the education and advocacy nonprofit Mental Health America (MHA). Some people find themselves seeking mental health care in a moment of crisis. For example, they’re losing control of their ability to work, go to school, or be present for loved ones, or are in danger of harming themselves or other people. In these cases, finding care is urgent — and it’s now a comparatively straightforward process, said Rochford: The 988 suicide and crisis lifeline, which rolled out nationally in July 2022 , provides around-the-clock emotional support to people in distress and, if needed, connects people with services and facilities in their area. If you are in crisis, you can dial 988 from any phone, access the chat feature from the 988 website , or text MHA to the number 741741. For people who aren’t in crisis, the symptoms that lead them to seek mental health care may include both emotional and physical sensations. Many people seeking mental health care for the first time offer reasons including feeling particularly sad or overwhelmed, sensing constant worry, or being unable to turn off an internal voice, says Marnie Shanbhag , a psychologist based in Winter Park, Florida, who works for the American Psychological Association. Others report trouble concentrating, trouble sleeping, or low energy. People may also seek care to help change or get through specific moments in life, said Rochford. You might want to understand why you make certain choices or how to think through a problem you’re facing. Maybe you want help managing some unhealthy coping skills, like relying too much on alcohol or drugs, or working through some conflicts in a romantic or family relationship. Or perhaps you’re interested in seeing if you’d benefit from medication or getting a diagnosis. The toolkit for treating mental health concerns is large, and you don’t need to know exactly which tools you need in order to start getting care. However, it can be helpful to have an objective in mind, says Rochford: “Give some thought to what your goals are, and then give some thought to how to best go about meeting those needs,” she says. Websites like NAMI’s and MHA’s can help you put words to feelings or symptoms that are difficult to describe. There are also lots of mental health “warmlines,” free and confidential support lines that provide help over the phone: NAMI runs a national helpline , and many states run their own warmlines . These are different from hotlines like 988 in that they’re geared less toward supporting people through a crisis and more toward connecting people with resources for future care. These websites and helplines can also help you get oriented to the array of resources people with mental health concerns can access. Although many people may think of talk therapy and medications as the cornerstones of care, there are also self-help and support groups , peer support and other community care approaches, and a range of nonmedication treatments that can be helpful in lots of situations. For certain serious mental illnesses that are harder to treat, electroconvulsive therapy may play a role, and a range of psychedelic drugs are showing a lot of promise. Mental health professionals are generally pretty comfortable helping you find the right place to start, even if it means connecting you to a different provider with the best expertise for your specific need If you’re not sure how to proceed even after some research, consider running your concerns past your primary care provider, says Rochford. “It can be very helpful to talk to somebody you trust who can kind of serve as a compass,” she says. Primary care providers likely know of mental health providers in your area, and can often start and manage medications for mental health complaints. Plus, it’s wise to rule out the possibility that a physical condition is contributing to your symptoms. Ultimately, mental health professionals are generally pretty comfortable helping you find the right place to start, even if it means connecting you to a different provider with the best expertise for your specific need, says Shanbhag.

If you’re insured, look at your plan details (or call the 800 number on your insurance card) to figure out what kinds of treatment your insurer covers. There may be a deductible — that is, a portion of the cost that you pay regardless of the total cost — and that amount may vary quite a bit between plans. Some plans also fully cover a certain number of visits with a provider before you start paying out of pocket. The upshot is that there’s a ton of variation between plans, so if you’re insured, avoid surprises by checking with your insurer before seeking care. Many insurance plans have a network of providers whose services cost less to people in the plan than providers outside the network. Typically, these providers live in your state — although in the case of some online-only providers, they may live in another state but be licensed in yours. Many plans will pay some percentage of the total cost for providers in their network, and a lower percentage (or nothing) for providers out of network. Even if you do have insurance, getting your mental health care paid for is often different from getting physical health care paid for. Many therapists give you their bill directly, which you pay and then submit to your insurer for reimbursement. If you don’t have health insurance, you still have options. If you want therapy, paying full price out of pocket may be an option. It’s costly, typically ranging from $100 to $200 for a session. Some providers offer therapy on a sliding scale — which means lower costs for people with less ability to pay — so it’s worth asking. Additionally, many online-only providers provide services to people paying out of pocket (some also accept certain insurance plans). There are also low- and no-cost options, both for therapy and for other types of treatment. Rochford suggests looking for universities with graduate programs training people to provide psychotherapy; these often offer treatment for free. Additionally, self-help and support groups are typically free to attend. For more information on the financial side of mental health treatment, check out: This article on NAMI’s website MHA’s Paying for Care page I don’t know how to find a therapist ... For many people with a mental health concern, psychotherapy — treatment that involves talking with a therapist to help identify and change bothersome feelings, thoughts, and behaviors — is part of the treatment plan. Looking for a therapist, though, can easily lead to more questions than answers: The acronyms describing different treatment approaches and skill sets may be confusing to people, and it might not be clear how to determine the cost-effectiveness of choices upfront. To start a search, it can be helpful to begin by considering your finances. If cost is a priority and you’re insured, it’s worth starting with the list of in-network providers your insurer maintains. You can search online for the names of individual providers to get some information about the populations and issues they typically focus on in their practice, or you can call individual providers to ask whether they have experience dealing with people whose concerns are similar to yours. Psychology Today maintains a large directory where therapists can pay to be listed alongside details about their practice, as do several other websites, or you can simply plug their name and “therapist” into a search engine. Among the lower-cost therapy options available for both insured and uninsured people are the mental health services many local health departments and community-based organizations may offer. For people of faith, clergypeople may serve as a good resource, and for children, check to see if a school guidance counselor can provide some help. Although some therapists see patients only in person or online, many offer both as an option. “The pandemic changed the way we thought about telehealth,” says Jeff Ashby , a psychologist and professor at Georgia State University who researches stress and trauma. “What we discovered — consistent with previous research — is that a whole lot of issues can be treated using telehealth.” There might be some small advantages to in-person therapy: It allows your therapist to read your body language, not just your facial expressions, and makes building a therapeutic relationship a little easier. In part for that reason, Catharina Chang , a professor and counselor at Georgia State University, recommends having at least one or two in-person sessions before switching to virtual interactions. But the best modality for accessing therapy really is the one that gets you the help you need. “The important thing is that you get help, and have a way you can get the help,” she says. If that means using a virtual-only platform, that’s fine! Lots of text-based therapy platforms have popped up in the past few years. Although these platforms offer what feels like an easy way to access support, experts advise approaching them with caution. State psychotherapist licensing boards, which accredit therapists based on their adherence to evidence-based best practices, haven’t approved text-based therapy, says McCray-Brown of MHA. “I would just caution folks to understand the implications of that, both in terms of the quality of service that they’re getting and what payment options are available to them,” she says. In other words, you’ll probably be paying out of pocket for text-based therapy — and there isn’t yet great evidence that it actually helps.

Or how to parse all of the different job titles among mental health providers If you’re choosing a therapist from a list, the array of letters following providers’ names can feel dizzying. It’s wise to keep a few things in mind as you look at credentials. First, there’s a difference between therapists who’ve been licensed by the state or states they practice in and those who haven’t. Licensed providers have to complete thousands of hours of supervised training before hanging up a shingle, have been extensively trained in diagnosing and treating mental health disorders, and are bound to keep your information confidential by HIPAA laws and ethical standards. None of this is guaranteed with unlicensed providers. The experts I spoke with suggested that unless you’re receiving therapy from a clergyperson under the umbrella of pastoral care, seeking out licensed providers is the safest route. Second, the paths to becoming a licensed therapist include getting a master’s degree (in counseling, social work, or marriage and family therapy) or a doctoral degree (typically in psychology). They also include a minimum of two years of supervised experience providing therapy. Although the degree alone doesn’t convey much in the way of a therapist’s fit or even their experience, a few differences may be of interest to potential patients: Psychologists (i.e., therapists with either a PhD in psychology or PsyD and at least three to five years of supervised experience) are trained in assessing a variety of mental disorders, which may be helpful for people seeking a diagnosis or treatment of a particular condition. Clinical social workers (i.e., therapists with a master’s degree in social work and at least two years of supervised experience) have experience in managing stressors related to housing, employment, and other social issues. When these issues overlap with mental health concerns, a therapist with this training can function as a “one-stop shop” in many ways, says Mirean Coleman , who directs clinical practice at the National Association of Social Workers. Licensed professional counselors (i.e., therapists with a master’s degree in counseling and at least two years of supervised experience) have training in diagnosis and can provide one-on- one and group counseling. Some have focused training in rehabilitation and school counseling. Licensed marriage and family therapists (i.e., therapists with a master’s degree in counseling and at least two years of supervised experience) also have training in diagnosis, along with additional training in family systems and how close interpersonal relationships work. Psychiatrists are medical doctors with training in diagnosing and treating many types of mental illness. They less commonly provide talk therapy nowadays, but unlike most other therapists, they can prescribe medication. Typically, if a therapist determines a patient would benefit from medication, they refer them to a psychiatrist (or a psychiatric nurse practitioner ) to prescribe and manage the medication, and stay on as the provider of psychotherapy for the patient. So as long as your therapist has experience in the issue you need help with, it makes sense to put more weight into whether you “click” with the person you’re seeing and less into what letters they have following their name. Beyond differences in their degrees, there’s a ton of other variations among therapists: Many develop expertise in working with certain populations — for example, older adults, or LGBTQ people. Some get special training in caring for people with certain diagnoses or experiences (like obsessive- compulsive disorder, eating disorders, or trauma). Different therapists often specialize in several of a variety of treatment methods , like cognitive behavioral therapy (used for a range of conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, and schizophrenia), dialectical behavioral therapy (a frequent treatment for borderline personality disorder), acceptance and commitment therapy (also used for a broad range of conditions, including obsessive-compulsive, eating, and substance use disorders), and eye movement desensitization reprocessing therapy (often used for treating post-traumatic stress disorders). It’s not uncommon for people with certain identities — like those with certain racial, ethnic, religious, gender, or sexuality affiliations — to seek out therapists who share that identity. “It’s natural, healthy, and valid that folks want to work with a clinician or work with a mental health care worker that has a similar experience to them,” says McCray-Brown of MHA. That doesn’t mean that a mismatch is a bad thing. In fact, says McCray-Brown, “you might be able to find a sense of confidence and empowerment in educating others about your experience.” Additionally, good providers should have enough cultural humility to validate the experiences you bring to the table as part of your identity. For people who prefer to see a therapist with some cultural overlap but are struggling to find one, it’s reasonable to prioritize seeing someone who otherwise has the skills and fit that works for you rather than waiting. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good here — but at the same time, don’t hesitate to ask for changes if your experience isn’t affirmed and validated, says McCray-Brown. For more information on types of mental health professionals, check out: MHA’s Finding the Right Clinical Mental Health Care For You Don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good here — but at the same time, don’t hesitate to ask for changes if your experience isn’t affirmed and validated I’m worried I won’t vibe with my therapist The fit between a patient and their therapist is the most important thing in determining whether therapy will be productive, says Ashby. But it can be difficult to predict what kind of person you’ll click with in therapy. “Think about it as shopping,” he says. “There may be really talented therapists for whom you’re not a good fit,” and if that only becomes clear after you’ve been seeing them a while, you’re still absolutely within your rights — and not in violation of any norms — to move on to someone who’s a better fit. “Good therapists only want to work with clients who are good matches because no one wants to be unsuccessful,” says Ashby. As you start looking for a therapist, it’s key to remember that therapists are aware of the importance of fit between themselves and their clients, and they’ll know it’s totally normal for you to talk to a few people before settling on someone to work with. You shouldn’t be getting a hard sell from a therapist: Instead, you should get a clear sense that they’re well-qualified and open to working with you, but that it’s your choice to work with them. McCray-Brown suggests asking prospective therapists for a 10- or 15-minute consultation call to get to know them and their practice. Questions that can help you get a feel for how you might work together include: What types of clients have you worked with before? Have you ever talked to somebody who’s dealing with the things I’m dealing with? What type of approach do you use in your therapy? How often will we be meeting? How long are individual therapy sessions? How would you handle it if I had a crisis? How long does treatment for a condition like mine typically take? For help finding local providers, have a look at: MHA’s guidance on finding a therapist . I’m not sure how to tell if it’s going well or when I no longer need treatment Getting therapy for mental health problems can be uncomfortable even when things are going well. Chang, of Georgia State University, suggests checking in with yourself after the first visit to determine if the fit is right. She recommends asking yourself if you felt heard, if the therapist seems like someone you can open up to, and if you were encouraged to talk about the goals and outcomes you want out of counseling. As psychiatrist Richard A. Friedman recently wrote in the Atlantic , most types of mental health therapy — and many mental health medications — have a common goal: “to eventually end treatment because you feel and function well enough to thrive on your own.” While some people with chronic conditions may need pharmacotherapy and individual or group support indefinitely, the majority of people who seek mental health care should consider it to be something they will eventually no longer need, or need only sporadically. The duration of therapy — and other types of mental health care — varies among people and conditions. Sometimes, a few sessions fix whatever was wrong, but more often, therapy uncovers the tip of an iceberg, says Ashby. Sure, you might “hassle around and finally find somebody and see somebody for two or six sessions and say, ‘I think I got it, I think these are the aches and pains of life,’” and feel like you’ve got it sorted out, he says. But more commonly, people have been spending a lot of emotional energy holding issues at bay by the time they finally seek treatment for a mental health concern, and it takes time to unpack things. Even then, writes Friedman, therapy typically lasts a few years at most, not indefinitely. Rochford suggests talking to your provider early on about what it will look like when you’ve reached your goals. Then, as you work together to figure out what you need, you’ll both know what an endpoint might look like. Some people may be ready for a deep dive into something that’s been impairing their function, like a history of trauma and a current major depressive disorder, says Rochford. Others might just want a few months of work on reducing burnout, setting better boundaries, or having a stronger relationship. The goals of mental health care look different for different people, she says: “You’re the expert on what you need, what’s going to work best for you, what you’re ready for.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Mohammad Shtayyeh, the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority (PA), nominally the group in charge of Palestinian parts of the West Bank , tendered his resignation and dissolved the PA government Monday. But Shtayyeh’s decision might not hold much weight in the face of an ossified organization, led by 88-year-old President Mahmoud Abbas, facing an uncertain postwar future. The PA has been the representative of the Palestinian people on the world stage since the 1990s. Abbas took over in 2004, but a combination of corrupt leadership, Israeli aggression and expansionist policies , and the power struggle between the PA and Hamas has diminished the organization’s power — and its legitimacy in the eyes of Palestinians. The PA remains an important organization internationally, including to the US government. In discussions about the Occupied Palestinian Territories’ status after Israel’s war on Gaza , the US has advocated for the PA to be the governing authority in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem once the months-old war in Gaza is over, putting renewed focus on the organization. But both the US and Arab nations have pushed for change within the PA, arguing that it needs to institute reforms and hold elections that will renew its legitimacy among Palestinians. Shtayyeh’s resignation appears to be a step toward heeding international pressure. As he told his cabinet Monday, the “next stage and its challenges requires new governmental and political arrangements that take into account the new reality in the Gaza Strip ... the urgent need for an inter- Palestinian [national] consensus ... and the extension of the [PA’s] authority over the entire territory of Palestine,” the Financial Times reported . Shtayyeh will remain on in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed, which could take weeks. Abbas is expected to appoint Mohammad Mustafa, a World Bank economist and one of his close compatriots, as prime minister. But Shtayyeh’s resignation won’t necessarily trigger the changes that both external and internal stakeholders are asking for, diminished executive power among them. And there’s no sense of when Israel’s current war in Gaza will end — or what will happen to the people living there when it does. So while Shtayyeh’s resignation may signal an acknowledgment that Palestinian representation must change, it likely won’t mean any material change in the short term, either for the PA or for the Palestinian people overall. Who is Shtayyeh in the Palestinian political landscape? The PA was set up in the 1990s during the Oslo Accords — ostensibly the first stage of negotiations to Palestinian self-rule, though no mechanism for further negotiations or a final outcome was decided and a future Palestinian state was not specified. At that time, the PA was led by Palestine Liberation Organization Chair Yasser Arafat. It was technically the governing authority over the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem from 1994 until 2006, although Israel occupied Gaza until 2005 and Arafat was under house arrest during the Second Intifada in the early 2000s. But Hamas won a parliamentary majority in the 2006 elections, eventually leading to a civil war between the PA and Hamas, and Hamas taking over Gaza in 2007. In the intervening years, Abbas’s government has come to be viewed as corrupt and a tool of the Israeli occupation , in part because Israel now controls much of the West Bank, as well as access to PA tax revenue. As prime minister, Shtayyeh’s role is to convene the PA government — that is, to organize and preside over meetings of the ministers of government agencies. These sessions are supposed to be approved by the Palestinian legislature, but it hasn’t met regularly since 2007, and the mandate of its elected members expired in 2010. That means that Abbas rules by decree in the areas of the West Bank where he actually has governing authority. Abbas appointed Shtayyeh to his current position in 2019, but he has been part of the PLO structure since 2009, when he was elected to the Fatah Central Committee. Fatah, to which Abbas also belongs, is one of the political parties comprising the PLO, and is the dominant force in the PA. Shtayyeh and Abbas are known to be close, though Shtayyeh has occasionally flouted the PA party line, exiting political negotiations with the US and Israel in 2014 over expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank, for example. But for the most part, Shtayyeh is “part of that inner circle, Abbas’s inner circle — which is shrinking,” Khaled Elgindy, director of the Middle East Institute’s program on Palestine and Palestinian- Israeli Affairs, told Vox in an interview. “He’s survived, but it’s a low bar. He operates at the direction of the president, he’s not an independent PM like [Salam] Fayyad was. He’s more of a loyalist.” It’s possible, then, that Shtayyeh’s resignation comes at Abbas’s behest, so that Abbas can, at least superficially, appear to respond to the demand for change that is now coming from several fronts, both internally and externally. It’s also notable that the resignation comes ahead of planned negotiations for a unity government between Fatah and Hamas this week in Moscow, as well as an announcement from US President Joe Biden that ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas are now showing promise. Given those circumstances, Shtayyeh’s resignation could be read as a gesture to Hamas leadership, but “the resignation of Shtayyeh’s government only makes sense if it comes within the context of national consensus on arrangements for the next phase,” Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, told Reuters Monday. Shtayyeh’s resignation will change little in the short term The PA is desperately unpopular among Palestinians, for some of the reasons it and Abbas have been a satisfactory solution for the US and Western countries — mostly that it cooperates with the Israeli state and entrenches the status quo. Abbas “is someone who never went to weddings or funerals, never shook hands or kissed babies,” Yezid Sayigh, senior fellow at the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, told Vox in an interview. “And so he basically hid behind his walls, and sought out international interlocutors and hoped that somehow the fact that he demonstrated time and again that he was committed to the Oslo framework and to security coordination with Israel would somehow buy him credit.” But Abbas’s government has almost no internal legitimacy , and its external legitimacy — particularly among Arab states supportive of a Palestinian state and increasingly within the US and the West — is failing. Abbas “gets less popular every single day,” Elgindy said. “He’s overestimating his position here; he doesn’t have a strong hand domestically. He’s maybe banking on being the only game in town” for future Palestinian leadership. Abbas has shown himself unwilling to name a potential successor , to cede executive power to a prime minister, to submit to elections, or to negotiate with Hamas to build a government that might be able to oversee the Occupied Palestinian Territories. All that means that regardless of who is prime minister, political conditions for Palestinians probably won’t change much as long as Abbas is still president and still the chair of the PLO. “The issue is and has been Abbas, not Shtayyeh,” Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox. And even if and when the PA forms a new technocratic government, as the US and Arab countries want, “most bureaucrats will be the same.” Though US and other external stakeholders hope the dissolution of the PA government will provide the change that they are looking for to govern the Palestinian territories in the future, several major hurdles beyond the PA internal politics remain, not the least of which is Israel’s opposition to PA involvement in a postwar scenario. In the past, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vehemently opposed such a role for the PA; his new postwar game plan didn’t rule out the PA’s participation but didn’t expressly endorse it, either . Arab states that could fund Gaza’s reconstruction — namely Saudi Arabia and the UAE — won’t do so without an explicit path toward future Palestinian statehood . Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","Today’s primary in Michigan offers us a potential forecast for November. Rashida Tlaib, the congresswoman representing a heavily Muslim and more heavily Democrat district, encourages those in her party to vote “uncommitted” in protest over the Biden administration’s support for Israel in its war with Hamas. Should the percentage of the uncommitted rise well into the double digits, this could act as the canary in the coalmine on President Joe Biden’s chances in the fall. He trails Donald Trump by 2 points in the most recent poll of Michigan voters on this presumptive fall matchup. Certainly, most who vote uncommitted in the Democrat primary Tuesday hold their noses and vote for Biden — or, more precisely, against Donald Trump — in the fall. But should even 5 percent of regular Democrat voters stay home or vote third party, Biden cannot win. And the last time a Democrat won the presidency but lost Michigan occurred in 1976, when the Republican candidate (President Gerald Ford) came from Michigan.

If the current conditions seem to echo the extreme weather storylines of 2023, that’s because many of the factors behind them remain in place. The world is still in the grips of El Niño , the warm phase of the Pacific Ocean’s temperature cycle. El Niño tends to amplify warming around the world, particularly between November and March — and this El Niño is especially strong. The warm ocean water near the equator, which has been about 3.2 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the average , also leads to more evaporation and thus more rainfall, energizing the atmospheric rivers that have drenched the West Coast and triggered floods this year. And underneath it all, humans are continuing to pump heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere at an alarming rate by burning coal, oil, and natural gas , lifting carbon dioxide concentrations up to levels never seen by humans and not experienced on Earth for millions of years. The warm weather we’re seeing now is directly in line with what scientists expect as the planet heats up, and conditions once seen as extreme will become far more common in the coming decades. Some of strongest climate change effects manifest in the winter Earth’s warming due to climate change isn’t spread evenly across the globe or throughout the year. Polar regions are warming up to four times as fast as the rest of the world, for instance. Further away from the poles, wintertime is heating up fast. In the US, many northern states are seeing winters warm twice as fast as summers, according to the fifth National Climate Assessment report, published last year. Much of the world is experiencing above-average temperatures, with some of the biggest changes in the Northern Hemisphere. Climate Reanalyzer One reason winters are heating up faster is that cooler, drier winter air tends to have a stronger, more consequential response to temperature increases. Every rise in air temperature of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit means another 7 percent more moisture retained. So, starting from a dry and frigid baseline, increasing humidity in the air leads to relatively more heat trapped near the ground, raising temperatures. Another way climate change affects winter is precipitation. When temperatures rise above 32 degrees Fahrenheit, it leads to more rain than snow. Regions like the Western US rely on snow accumulation in the mountains to store water for use throughout the year, and more rain than snow can mean more flooding in the winter and drought in the summer. On the other hand, if air temperatures rise but stay below freezing, that can lead to more snowfall since there is more water in the air. The Southern Hemisphere’s summers are getting more intense It’s been a searingly hot summer south of the equator, and the region also had an unusually warm winter. Cities like Buenos Aires, Argentina , saw their hottest winter months in more than a century. In Australia, it was the hottest winter ever recorded . The Southern Hemisphere has some different dynamics from the Northern Hemisphere. The big one is that there is proportionately more ocean than land in the south. Oceans absorb heat and act as buffers against big temperature swings, so winters usually don’t get too chilly and summers don’t often reach sweltering levels. But the world’s oceans have been unusually warm since last year, and that’s helped maintain warm air over land masses in the Southern Hemisphere. And South America in particular is in the line of fire for El Niño. The region has already experienced both extensive flooding and drought fueled by warmer water off the Pacific coast, leading to shifting rainfall patterns. The heat has also contributed to wildfires across the continent. In Chile, wildfires have already killed more than 120 people . It’s hot underwater too The world’s oceans near the equator right now remain at record high temperatures . Water temperatures have topped 90 degrees Fahrenheit in regions like the Caribbean. In addition to absorbing heat, oceans soak up close to 30 percent of humanity’s carbon dioxide emissions. The combination of higher temperatures and more carbon dioxide is changing the chemistry of the water. In recent months, this has threatened fragile ecosystems like coral reefs . Off the Florida Keys, corals suffered mass bleaching events and die-offs driven by marine heat waves. The warm waters have reached as far south as Antarctica, which saw a record low extent of sea ice last year. As summer has picked up, sea ice around the southern continent is no longer at absolute record low levels but still far below what’s typical. Antarctica is important because it influences both the ocean and the sky. As the waters around it freeze and thaw, and as its glaciers melt into the sea, the region alters how nutrients flow in ocean currents and shapes clouds and rainfall around the world . The looming question is whether 2024 will reach new temperature highs over the rest of the year. El Niño is likely to persist until April, but it’s not clear how much the planet will cool down afterward. NOAA projected that there’s a 22 percent chance that 2024 will be the new hottest year on record, and a 99 percent chance it will rank in the top five. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Editor’s note, March 27, 5 pm ET: Jenn Tran has been named the first Asian American Bachelorette in the franchise’s 22-year history. For the first time in years, The Bachelor franchise had not one, not two, but multiple contestants of Asian descent who were prominent contenders. Historically, there have been a handful of Asian participants who have made it to later rounds in the show. But in most seasons, there are few — if any — Asian contestants across both The Bachelor and Bachelorette . Those who are cast are often eliminated early, sidelined as supporting characters, or reduced to meek stereotypes. Tammy Ly, a fan favorite from the 24th season, has spoken about how she felt “alienated” by the franchise and treated as a secondary character because she didn’t fit a white ideal of beauty. The Bachelor franchise has long been critiqued for its overwhelmingly white casting , storylines that amplify discriminatory tropes , and high-profile contestants who’ve made racist statements. In recent seasons, the show has attempted to address these disparities — with mixed results. Notably, ABC cast its first Black Bachelorette, Rachel Lindsay, in 2017, and it has sought to diversify its contestant pool in the years since. As Rachel Lindsay and other contestants have emphasized, however, the changes to casting alone haven’t been sufficient to combat systemic issues the franchise suffers from, onscreen and behind the scenes. The most recent season, its 28th, revealed how The Bachelor still struggles with many of these problems even as it took some small steps forward. In showcasing a diverse group of Asian women, the show introduced new perspectives on everything from growing up in an immigrant household to cultural family traditions, viewpoints that haven’t been highlighted much on its platform. It still fell short, however, in grappling with the discrimination that its contestants of color face and confronting conversations about the need to explicitly call out racism. Five women of Asian descent stayed late into the current season as both popular contenders and villains . Notably, a few of these women — Rachel Nance, an ICU nurse from Hawaii, of Filipino and African American descent; and Jenn Tran, a physician assistant student from Florida, of Vietnamese descent — were among the final six contestants, a development that makes it more likely that one of them could get picked as the lead for a following season. (Typically, the show selects its next star based on the women or men who don’t “win” from the prior season.) Featuring more Asian contestants on the show — and highlighting them — has not only helped dispel stereotypes, but also enabled portrayals that were more multidimensional and human. Having an Asian lead — a long overdue first for both The Bachelor and The Bachelorette — would bring even more representation to the reality TV giant, expand the universe of stories that it tells, and provide new visibility to members of a group that have long been underrepresented in media. Telling people’s stories counters stereotypes and humanizes them The Bachelor franchise’s history of quickly dropping candidates of color, including Asian contestants, is so well-known it has spurred satirical spinoffs like WongFu Production’s “Asian Bachelorette,” in which nearly all the contestants are of Asian descent. In past seasons, there were usually one or two Asian contestants, though few advanced to later episodes, with Catherine Giudici, Ivan Hall, Caila Quinn, Ethan Kang, and Serena Pitt among the handful of exceptions. Additionally, if they aren’t eliminated early, contestants of color typically get less screen time than white contestants . And when they have appeared, some of their storylines have exacerbated old tropes, including ideas of Asian women as docile or hypersexual. In season 24 of The Bachelor , for example, Marylynn Sienna is effectively used by a white woman named Victoria Larson to advance her storyline. Larson arbitrarily accuses Marylynn of being “toxic,” forcing her to defend herself in the face of a bully. In Season 10 of The Bachelor , a Cambodian American woman named Channy Choch debuted on the show by inviting the lead to have sex with her in Cambodian, later noting that he needed to catch “Cambodian fever.” By putting real time and investment into Asian contestants’ storylines, this season has delivered more nuanced depictions of their experiences and the chance to see more humanized narratives. Rachel’s hometown date with Bachelor Joey Graziadei, a milestone that takes place near the end of the season when the lead meets a contestant’s family, was a vibrant glimpse of how Filipino and Hawaiian culture have shaped her. Prior to the visit, Rachel informs Joey that he should touch her mother’s hand to his forehead when they meet, a gesture known as “Mano po ,” which conveys respect. And during the date, Rachel’s family warmly receives him with a roast pig in the backyard and schools him on a Filipino courtship tradition. @bachelornationabc Joey with the Mano Po ♬ original sound - The Bachelor Rachel has also discussed her upbringing in Hawaii as a mixed-race person, offering a perspective that’s rarely been highlighted on the show, and emphasizing how her family has blended different cultures. “Growing up as a mixed girl in Hawaii, there wasn’t many people who looked like me on TV,” she said in a People interview . “I’m very honored that moving forward, girls can say, ‘Hey, if Rachel can do that, I can do that. If Rachel can speak her truth, I can speak her truth.’” Another moving moment this season centered on Jenn and her description of the trauma she experienced growing up in a dysfunctional household. In one scene, Jenn spoke candidly about the conflict in her immigrant family, prompting what she’s said has been an outpouring from fans who have similar backgrounds. While on a one-on-one date with Joey, Jenn described how her parents often had volatile fights when she was a kid and how her relationship with her father has deteriorated in the years since as a result. “I wanna acknowledge the comments and DMs I’ve been getting from people who say that they can relate to my story and I just want to say that I’m so sorry you can relate,” Jenn said in a TikTok post. “It felt so nice to hear another Viet woman go through the same generational trauma that I went through,” one of the top commenters on the post wrote. @jenntranx Toxic relationships is something i really want to talk about bc often times we dont know we’re in one bc it creeps up on you but i want everyone to know theyre deserving of love and to not let history repeat itself #toxic #toxicrelationship #emotionalabuse #abuse #relationships #relationshipadvice ♬ original sound - Jenn Tran Both Nance and Tran also received “hot seats,” or special interviews, in the recent “Women Tell All” episode, often a sign ABC is considering them as potential leads. Nance was known on the show for her level-headed energy, commitment to her career, and “slow burn” relationship with Joey, while Tran’s bubbly personality, openness to adventure, and a playful connection were her signature. Both women, who were eliminated in recent weeks, were charismatic contenders and would be compelling future stars. Being able to see an array of Asian women depicted this season was significant as well because it highlighted a wide spectrum of personalities. In addition to Rachel and Jenn, who were portrayed more prominently as frontrunners focused on vying for Joey’s affections, Katelyn DeBacker, a radiochemist from New Mexico of Vietnamese descent, was seen as bringing her quirk and humor to the show, and Madina Alam, a therapist of Bangladeshi descent, was synonymous with her thoughtful and considerate responses to the bizarre drama swirling around her. Lea Cayanan, an account manager from Hawaii who is of Filipino descent, also received what is known in Bachelor parlance as a “villain edit,” in a way barrier-breaking in itself. After dueling with fellow contestant Maria Georgas — a white executive assistant from Ontario, Canada — Lea became associated with causing drama and coming off as a “mean girl.” While her actions were far from laudable, it was interesting to see an Asian woman embrace the role of the villain after years of other portrayals as submissive sidekicks. That said, when you distill that storyline to its essence, she was still used to draw a contrast with a white counterpart , a problematic plot point of its own. It’s uncommon to see Asian women depicted in pop culture in a way that’s more complicated and messy, NPR’s Deepa Shivaram previously wrote about Devi, the protagonist of the Netflix show Never Have I Ever. Harleen Singh, director of the Women’s Studies Research Center at Brandeis University, emphasized that representation and the breaking of stereotypes require the chance for people to be their full selves and not just an ideal that’s been set out for them. “It’s ... [the ability] to just be human beings who have errors, who have wants, who are contradictory. Pardon my French, but to f*** up as much as anybody else,” Singh previously told NPR . Contestants have also forced discussions about racism Asian contestants have also used their platforms to force conversations about racism that would otherwise be left poorly addressed by a franchise ill-equipped to confront them. One of the early examples of this was tied to a mistake that The Bachelor’s social media accounts made in January, when it tagged the wrong Asian person in an Instagram post. In a photo of Jenn kissing Joey, The Bachelor account instead tagged Lea. That mistake then sparked a discussion about how Asian people have been confused for one another in different settings, including the workplace, and how dehumanizing those errors can be. In response to the mix-up, Jenn posted a TikTok video sharing an experience of how a nurse she worked with wasn’t able to tell her apart from another Asian staff member, despite having known each other for a year. “The issue at hand is not that you can’t tell me apart from different Asians, it’s the fact that you don’t care,” Jenn said in the video. @jenntranx This is why Asian representation on TV is so important. The lack of exposure directly correlates to the ignorance. I’m not saying everyone is guilty of cultural ignorance but it is disheartening to see how many news articles about me have used pictures of other Asian women who clearly do not look like me. Let’s continue to take accountability, learn from others and lead with love always #culturalignorance #diversity #asianamerican #asian #culture #vietnamese ♬ original sound - Jenn Tran It’s a problem that’s so commonplace that designer Linh-Yen Hoang has released a pithy pin that simply reads, “Wrong Asian.” And while people often brush off such actions as honest mistakes, they essentially suggest that Asian people are interchangeable, reaffirming tropes that Asian people are a monolithic group devoid of individuality. “Whether the person acted without malice, the effect is the same: It erases my body of work for someone else’s, simply because their ancestors were born on the same continent as mine,” Washington Post reporter Michelle Ye Hee Lee wrote in 2019 . “It tells me that my place in journalism — and that of the other Asian reporter they confused me for — is dispensable, interchangeable and indistinguishable.” Jenn’s and Lea’s perspectives were ultimately invaluable in having a deeper conversation about this mishap and in drawing attention to a widespread issue that some may write off as trivial. “Until we have a world stage and a media platform that is representative of the world we come from and the communities that make it up, I think we will always have a ways to go,” Lea stated in her response . During the “Women Tell All” episode, Rachel also spoke about racism she’s faced from viewers of the show, revealing that people have bombarded her with messages calling her the “N-word” and “jungle Asian.” Many of these attacks came after Rachel was chosen to move forward as one of the final three contestants instead of Maria, who has accrued a large fanbase. Rachel’s comments have renewed attention to the racism within the Bachelor fandom and the harassment that contestants of color, in particular, have faced. That conversation showed, too, how much work the show still needs to do to protect its contestants and to thoughtfully handle the subject. Rather than specifically addressing the racism that Rachel experienced, for instance, host Jesse Palmer quickly pivoted to asking the rest of the cast if they had received “hateful” comments in a follow-up to her remarks. In doing so, he glossed over the specific racism she was experiencing and sought to broaden the focus to more general harassment that the cast of women has faced. “It is part of my Asian culture to remain quiet, always be respectful, and apologize first. No more,” Rachel wrote in an Instagram post. “It is time that we speak up. To all my minorities... speak up and speak loud.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rachel Nance (@rachelmariean) Whether it’s offering viewers a window into their personalities and upbringings, or vocally condemning enduring racism in the franchise, the contestants of this season have brought new voices to a tired show. Leads on the show, in particular, also send a message about who has agency in these relationships, and who’s deserving of this chance to find love. Casting Rachel or Jenn as the next Bachelorette would be a huge opportunity to keep these conversations going — and reframe that narrative. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Chicago’s decision to move forward with a controversial migrant eviction proposal is underscoring ongoing gaps in immigration policy that continue to exist across the country — and the inhumane quick fixes that are being used in the meantime. Earlier this month, Chicago began evicting migrants from homeless shelters after Mayor Brandon Johnson instituted a policy stating that people must leave these centers after 60 days. The goal, Johnson has said, is to incentivize migrants to find permanent housing and to free up space in these shelters, which have become overwhelmed past their breaking points in recent months . Migrants can apply for extensions if they have an extenuating circumstance, or if they are in the process of moving to permanent housing. Those who don’t have housing lined up can also return to the city’s migrant “landing zone,” a center established to process new migrants, and reapply for a shelter spot. Advocates and progressive lawmakers have criticized the policy for being inhumane. As newcomers to the US, many migrants don’t have existing funds for housing and are waiting on work permits. Those who don’t have families or other social networks in the US are often struggling to find a place to stay as well as a way to remain afloat financially. “New arrivals may be offered the opportunity to go to the landing zone, but many will likely end up living on the streets and parks near the shelter they were displaced from,” the Progressive Caucus of the Chicago City Council wrote in a recent statement . Chicago’s response points to challenges affecting a number of cities — including New York — as they’ve grappled with an influx of thousands of migrants, many of whom have been bussed or flown there from the southern border by Republican governors like Texas’s Greg Abbott . It also highlights holes in federal immigration policy when it comes to both funding and migrant resettlement that leave local leaders grasping for a temporary patch. “We have literally built an entire infrastructure for an international crisis that Congress hasn’t figured out,” Johnson said in January, regarding the construction of new shelters. Chicago’s policy, briefly explained Johnson first announced this policy last November as the city tried to stem the growing number of migrants arriving there, navigate concerns from existing residents, and assist the migrants who had already arrived. As of late March, there were 10,555 migrants living in the city’s 23 homeless shelters, a decrease from earlier in the year. Since 2022 , Chicago has seen a large jump of more than 37,000 migrants arriving in the city, a notable uptick relative to recent years. Following the surge in migrant arrivals in August 2022, Chicago began setting up emergency shelters in order to accommodate this increase, dubbing itself “the welcoming city.” As a sanctuary city, it’s committed to providing services for migrants regardless of immigration status, and it’s pledged not to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport people. The investments the city has made in the months since include setting up numerous shelters in parks, schools, and hotels; establishing a “landing zone” center where migrants can go when they initially arrive; and providing social services and a caseworker for each new arrival. In total , this effort cost Chicago at least $138 million in 2023 , and it’s expected to cost at least another $150 million this year. “The City’s goal is to provide short-term emergency shelter to new arrivals as they are connected to resources including public benefits,” a Chicago mayor’s office spokesperson, told Vox via email. But as this month’s changes make evident, Chicago and other cities weren’t really prepared for the long term. The city’s policies — and residents’ reactions — to the incoming migrants have also changed as more people have arrived. At first, city officials emphasized Chicago’s welcoming history, but as the number of migrant arrivals grew in 2023, and shelters and services became overwhelmed, local leaders both sounded the alarm for federal support and introduced proposals like evictions. Under the new shelter policy, migrants who have been in a shelter for 60 days must leave or reapply for a spot. Several exemptions also exist for families with school-age children, pregnant people, and those who are ill, buying the majority of migrants staying in these shelters more time. In the initial two days of evictions, eight single migrants were forced to leave, while roughly 2,000 could be required to do so by the end of April. A chief concern regarding such policies is that they effectively leave migrants with nowhere to go. The city has urged migrants to apply for state rental assistance so they can find permanent housing, but it’s not guaranteed that they will qualify or that they’ll receive it in time. Similarly, it could take awhile for any applications for work permits to be approved, and only a fraction of the newcomers in Chicago likely qualify for such approvals. “It really stresses me out. What am I going to do? Where am I going to go?” Daniel Vizcaino, a 20-year-old Venezuelan asylum-seeker with an April move-out date, told NBC News. The implementation of this policy has already been delayed multiple times because of outcry from city council members and others, as well as freezing cold weather in the city. “We need an end to this policy, as it doesn’t solve our challenges, it merely exacerbates and displaces them,” Alderman Andre Vasquez has written in a letter. Other policies that Chicago has put in place include coordinating transportation for migrants to other destinations if they have a family member or secondary place to go. Chicago’s not alone in struggling to find long-term solutions for large influxes of migrants it initially welcomed. New York City also saw a surge of migrant arrivals over the last year, and spent an estimated $1.45 billion in the fiscal year of 2023 to provide shelter and support. This past January, New York City also began its own wave of evictions of migrant families , capping their stays in shelters at 60 days. And in mid- March, it announced that it was limiting single adult migrants to 30-day stays in the city’s shelters. These crises are due to deeper problems in the US immigration system Right now, cities are moving from one short-term solution to the next. Regional leaders, including Chicago Mayor Johnson and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, have stressed that the current situation is not sustainable for them and that they’re in desperate need of more federal funding, as well as policy changes on issues like work permits. The federal government has provided millions in grants to both Chicago and New York , but those funds aren’t seen as sufficient to help address the scope of the problem. Similarly, the White House has streamlined applications for some work permits , but those changes are likely only a fraction of what is needed. According to Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute (a think tank that’s opposed Trump’s immigration policies in the past), it can take months for migrants to get a work permit depending on their immigration status. While those with parole status or temporary protective status (TPS) can try to apply for a work permit right away, asylum seekers must wait for their asylum applications to be approved before they can even start that process. And application processes for these permits can be complicated for newcomers as they navigate language barriers and bureaucratic documents. Larger changes to the work permit system are one of the more substantive solutions that regional leaders have also urged, but they’d likely require more federal action. Beyond responses to the immediate crisis, public officials, including Johnson, note that more immigration reforms are needed from Congress in order to build a better system for resettling migrants. As Vox’s Abdallah Fayyad has written, the US has established an effective federal policy for resettling refugees that helps place people across the country and provides access to social services. No comparable system currently exists for asylum seekers, leaving cities and states who are receiving these arrivals to develop ad hoc policies on their own. The prospect of approving such reforms, however, seems like a long shot as lawmakers have struggled to coalesce on even the most limited immigration proposals. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","The shocking collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge after it was hit by a cargo ship early Tuesday morning has the region reeling. Thus far, two people who were working on the bridge have been rescued and six are presumed dead by their employer, Brawner Builders, given the temperature of the water and the time that has passed since the accident, the Associated Press reported Tuesday evening . Sonar, robots, and human divers were among the resources deployed in the Coast Guard’s search, which ended some 18 hours after the collapse. The focus, now, is on the recovery of remains. “This is an unthinkable tragedy,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said at a press conference on Tuesday morning. The collapse of the bridge will also affect transportation in the region — and potentially global trade. Used by 31,000 vehicles each day, the Key Bridge is a central conduit for traffic in the area. The incident also comes as the global shipping industry is facing several other challenges, including a record-breaking drought in Panama and Houthi strikes on ships in the Red Sea . Due to closures at the Port of Baltimore — one of the busiest in the country, especially for foreign cargo — logistics and shipping companies will likely need to reroute more key deliveries. Authorities have acknowledged these concerns — and the challenges they pose — but emphasized that they’re secondary to the human lives affected. Why did the Baltimore bridge collapse? What happened with the ship? The incident took place around 1:30 am ET Tuesday when a large cargo ship called the Dali abruptly lost power and collided with a support column on the Key Bridge, a 1.6-mile structure that stretches across the Patapsco River. After the ship — which holds a volume of 95,000 gross tons — hit the column, video shows parts of the four-lane bridge crumbling rapidly and collapsing into the water. BREAKING: Ship collides with Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, causing it to collapse pic.twitter.com/OcOrSjOCRn — BNO News (@BNONews) March 26, 2024 Shortly before the collision, the crew of the ship, which is owned by a Singaporean company called Grace Ocean, reported that they had lost control of the vessel and issued a “mayday” call. Dali was originally headed from Baltimore to Colombo, Sri Lanka, on behalf of Maersk, the major Danish shipping and logistics company. As experts told USA Today , the bridge failure was so catastrophic because the ship took out a support column — a key component that kept it structurally sound — while going at a high speed. “Any bridge would have been in serious danger from a collision like this,” Nii Attoh-Okine , the chair of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Maryland, said . For now, it’s not clear what caused the ship to lose power, though the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is conducting an investigation. (Last June, an inspection in Chile found the Dali had some propulsion issues , but a standard US Coast Guard inspection later in the year found no problems.) Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB, said that agency investigators had boarded the ship overnight to collect data and will begin interviewing crew members Wednesday. Authorities have also concluded that there’s no evidence this was an intentional incident or terrorist attack. “Everything so far indicates that this was a terrible accident. At this time we have no other indication,” President Joe Biden said Tuesday afternoon in a press conference . What do we know about casualties from the Francis Key Bridge collapse? When the collapse happened, a group of eight construction workers were filling in potholes on the bridge. Two of those workers have been rescued, including one who was in stable condition and one who was hospitalized. The remains of the six other workers have not yet been found. They include people from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, several outlets report. The identities of the workers have prompted some to question the risks they faced . The tragedy, though, could have been far worse: thousands of vehicles cross the bridge each day on average. But immediately after the ship’s “mayday” call — and before it collided with the bridge — government officials were able to shut down additional vehicle traffic, preventing cars and passengers from being harmed. (Vehicles can be seen falling into the river in videos, but authorities said these were the parked cars of construction workers.) “These people are heroes. They saved lives last night,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said at a press conference about the ship’s crew. Are bridges safe? Has a cargo ship crashed into a bridge before? Yes, bridges are safe — but not as safe as they could be. In the 1970s, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) adopted the National Bridge Inspection Standards regulations, after a horrible 1967 accident in West Virginia where the Silver Bridge collapsed and killed 46 people . The accident ushered in a new era of bridge safety at the national level. In 2022, the FHWA updated its standards to incorporate recent technological advancements. But not all bridges are created equally. One in three bridges in the US are in need of repair or replacement, according to the American Road and Transportation Builders Association . Maintenance helps bridges be able to withstand stressors such as natural disasters, for instance. The FHWA classifies bridges into three ratings : good, fair, and poor. Those with poor ratings are prioritized for repairs first. To be clear, Key Bridge was structurally sound with a fair rating. It’s just not designed to absorb the shock of an incredibly large and heavy cargo ship ramming into it, engineers say . (As the Guardian’s Oliver Milman points out, current bridge code doesn’t account for today’s supersized cargo ships , some of which are far bigger than the Dali.) Nonetheless, the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency responsible for investigating transportation accidents, will be looking deeper into the safety of the bridge. “Part of our investigation will be how this bridge was constructed,” said Homendy during a NTSB press briefing Tuesday . She stressed it will take time, referencing the investigation for the 2022 Fern Hollow Bridge collapse in Pennsylvania, which took two years to fully complete. When it comes to the cargo ships: It is not uncommon for a ship to lose power as the Dali did Tuesday, according to attorney Matt Shaffer , who handles maritime law cases, and without power, a ship of that size can cause extensive damage. But cargo ships bumping into a bridge and causing it to collapse isn’t common. Since 1960, it’s happened just 35 times worldwide . As of 2015, a total of 342 people have died from bridge failures caused by ships . To put that in perspective, more than 40,000 people in the US died in a car accident in 2020, according to some estimates . How important is the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and what’s next for it? The Francis Scott Key Bridge — named after the poet who wrote the lyrics to what became the national anthem — not only connects commuters from one part of the harbor to another, it plays an important industrial role. It’s one of three major crossways for the Baltimore Harbor. In 2023, more than 12.4 million passenger and commercial vehicles crossed the bridge, according to the Maryland Transportation Authority . Bloomberg News reported that it transports $28 billion in goods annually — with nearly 4,900 trucks crossing daily. The bridge and its almost nine miles worth of approaches serve as a final link in I-695. From there, the interstate connects the city’s port to I-95, the major highway along the East Coast. Construction of the bridge started in 1972 and was completed March 1977. It cost $60.3 million at the time to build. The bridge is mostly made of lightweight concrete, according to a November 2021 report by the US Federal Highway Administration. Lightweight concrete, the report notes, isn’t typically used for bridge construction, but it “can be used as a durable and cost-effective material for bridges.” Bridges are a feat of engineering — and are rightfully expensive. A $60 million project in the 1970s would cost far more to execute today, especially given increased scrutiny for speed and safety (and inflation ). Rebuilding the bridge will likely cost “several billion dollars,” Yonah Freemark, a researcher at the Urban Institute, told Bloomberg . Biden, during the press conference Tuesday afternoon, said that it is his “intention” that the federal government will pay for reconstructing the bridge. “And I expect Congress to support my effort,” he added. Even with federal money, it could take months, if not years, to rebuild, disrupting both commercial and commuter traffic in the region. What does this mean for the shipping industry? The search and rescue operations have shut down the port of Baltimore, which has become an increasingly important shipping hub for the eastern US. The port is the 17th largest in the nation based on the amount of cargo that goes through the port, and it handles the largest amount of transportation cargo — cars and trucks, but also coal, farm equipment, and construction machinery, the New York Times reported . Kevin Doell, Maersk’s North American media representative, told Vox that the Dali was carrying a “wide variety of cargo” from a number of different customers, but did not elaborate. The broader economic impact will likely be limited — already, nearby ports like one in Virginia are talking about supporting temporary diversions . But the terminal’s closure could have regional effects, and it is another setback for the global shipping industry in an already difficult year. Maersk, the company that owns the Dali, said in January that it would no longer send its vessels through the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandeb strait near Yemen, where Houthi forces have targeted ships since November in response to the Israeli war in Gaza. Because of the risk of damage, injury, and kidnapping, some global shipping companies have opted to take the longer shipping route around the Horn of Africa, which can add as much as two weeks to a voyage and comes with attendant fuel and salary costs for the companies. The Panama Canal, another global commercial transit hub, is also causing issues for the industry. A massive drought in Panama has severely limited the number of ships that can use the canal, slowing transit times and increasing costs. Though the Baltimore port has played an increasing role in trade, it’s too soon to see what the commercial fallout will be. Other ports can absorb the container ships Baltimore would take — companies have the option to send their cargo to ports throughout the East Coast, including in New York and Virginia, industry executives told the Times . But the damage will most likely be felt in the auto industry , given that Baltimore is the country’s largest auto importer . General Motors and Ford were already re-routing their vehicles and auto parts to Brunswick, Georgia, as of Tuesday; that could mean some supply chain delays, but any disruptions are expected to be minimal, according to a statement from GM. Some companies may opt to send their goods to West Coast ports and then ship them east, rather than risk bottlenecks as eastern ports reorient their operations, Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen told Bloomberg . That was already going on prior to the accident, as 45,000 dockworkers with the International Longshoremen’s Association on the East and Gulf Coasts were threatening to strike should the union not reach a fair contract with ports and shipping companies by October 1.

"2","After the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7, 2023, the Houthis, a Yemeni rebel group, began attacking ships passing through the Red Sea. The Houthis pledged to attack any ship in these waters that does business with Israel , to protest Israel’s war in Gaza and to show solidarity with Palestinians there. But as the attacks have continued, another motive for them has become apparent: strengthening the Houthis’ control of Yemen. After nine years of civil war, the Houthis today control a sizable area in Yemen, with over 70 percent of the Yemeni population within the group’s territory. The conflict has devastated the country, creating one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. More than 377,000 Yemenis have been killed — by airstrikes from a Saudi-led coalition; landmines and detonations planted by the Houthis; a lack of medical services; and scarcity of food and water due to a naval blockade. And both the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis have been accused of committing war crimes against Yemenis. Today, the Houthis are attempting to establish themselves as Yemen’s legitimate leaders in the eyes of Yemenis, though they’ve done little to improve the country’s humanitarian crisis. The Red Sea attacks, which appear to have significant support among the Yemeni people, might be a means to achieve that goal. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","We know that America is really unhappy . And Finland is the happiest country. Right? Well, that’s what it says in the World Happiness Report , a wide- ranging survey on global happiness levels released last week. But before you pack your bags and move to Northern Europe, you might want a sneak peek at how the experts figure out who’s happy and who’s not . Believe it or not, it typically comes down to one question. The pollsters use something called the Cantril Ladder . They ask: “Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you, and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” Before you read any further, think for a second about how you would answer the question. Would you say your life is … a five? A seven? A nine? When I first did this exercise, I said my life is a seven out of 10. But behind this answer was a more complicated truth. I’d initially thought about rating my life a six. Yet there was a voice tugging at me, from my years of reporting on people living in extreme poverty . Compared to their lives, I figured mine was probably pretty easy. So I bumped up my rating. Did you implicitly find yourself doing something similar? Comparing yourself to others — either positively or negatively? A new paper from researchers in Scandinavia and the US suggests that’s actually very common — and it may be a flaw in the question itself. By showing a picture of a ladder and saying to imagine some people “at the top” and others “at the bottom,” the question may be influencing respondents to consider not so much their actual happiness as their status . Happiness and status are, of course, very different things. One is about overall well-being and the other is more about how much power or wealth you have relative to others. If the main question used to suss out people’s happiness isn’t really measuring that overall well- being at all, our results might be leading us astray. Related A surprisingly radical proposal: Make people happier — not just wealthier and healthier What is the World Happiness Report really measuring? Looking over the World Happiness Reports from previous years, the team of researchers from Scandinavia and the US noticed some “curious properties.” For one, we would expect that as countries become richer, their people become happier. But higher GDP doesn’t always correlate with increased happiness. Despite how wealthy the US is, Americans are only becoming more miserable, for a range of reasons . And people in some higher-GDP European countries like Portugal and Italy report lower life satisfaction than people in lower-GDP Latin American countries. What’s going on? It also turns out that when you present people with the Cantril Ladder and ask them which rung they’d prefer to be on, most of them do not say 10. On average, they say eight. That’s … baffling! Remember, 10 represents “the best possible life for you” — surely everyone wants that, don’t they? Curiouser and curiouser, thought the researchers. Suspecting that the framing of the question might be biasing the respondents, the researchers decided to investigate this empirically. They gathered randomized groups of participants and presented them with different versions of a question trying to measure well-being. They tried the original Cantril Ladder, but they also posed the question without the picture of the ladder and without the bottom-to-top description. Plus, they tried versions that don’t mention a ladder, a bottom or top, or even a “best possible life,” but instead just mention either “happiness” or “harmony.” Then they asked people what was on their minds when they answered the question and used AI to analyze the responses. The researchers found that each version of the question brought up different associations. Most notably, the original Cantril Ladder influenced respondents to focus more on power and wealth — not a very broad or holistic notion of well-being. The researchers also found that when they removed the ladder symbol and description, people associated well-being more with mental and physical health, relationships, and family. They still thought of money, but rather than thinking in terms of wealth, they thought in terms of financial security (the important thing was not to be richer than others but simply to have enough for a nice life). And crucially, they gave a more intuitive answer when asked which level of happiness they’d prefer, answering much closer to the “10” end of the spectrum. That makes sense. If you think a 10 is about being richer than others, you might actually feel like an asshole saying that’s your preferred level — it feels like you’re saying that you want to outrank others. Plus, as the researchers noted, “It is likely that the ladder framing imposes a hierarchical perspective that influences individuals to interpret it as less compatible with other essential aspects of well-being, such as belongingness and mutuality in relationships.” The great irony of comparing who’s happiest The takeaway here is not that the World Happiness Report is useless or that efforts to measure happiness are silly. These efforts can help inform policymakers around the world as they try to figure out which things correlate strongly with happiness so they can invest in those things. But we need to remember that our measurements often come with cultural metaphors baked in. They can affect the results without us even realizing it. That seems to be the case with the Cantril Ladder — and that means we should take the results with a big grain of salt. We should also remember that there’s a great irony in comparing my happiness with yours, or my country’s with your country’s. As any psychologist will tell you, comparing ourselves to others tends to make us very unhappy! In fact, this should be part of any discussion on why young Americans are so unhappy — a discussion that’s been in the media a lot this past week thanks to the World Happiness Report. While smartphones and especially social media are often blamed for the misery, we have to ask what it is about the tech that makes people so miserable. Research suggests a big part of it may be that Facebook , Instagram , and the rest turbocharge social comparison — poison for mental health . The poisonousness of social comparison can also help make sense of the observation that higher GDP doesn’t always correlate with increased happiness. The US has a high GDP, but it also has extremely high inequality. So a lot of Americans are comparing themselves to other, richer Americans — and becoming more miserable as a result. “In rich countries, where you have big sectors of the population that are declining relative to their peers, then they don’t have hope for the future,” Carol Graham, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland and a senior scientist at Gallup, told me last year. “As decades of evidence demonstrate, happiness often comes not from comparing ourselves to others, but through connection with them, something that might be missing from some of the [World Happiness] report’s key variables,” Jamil Zaki, a Stanford psychologist, noted . “As such, it’s ironic that many headlines about the report have focused on how countries ‘rank’ in happiness, reinforcing a competitive view that might be part of why we find it so hard to be happy in the first place!” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Baltimore woke up yesterday to horrific images of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsing into the harbor after the cargo ship Dali lost power and collided with a support column. It’s a horrible tragedy — six construction workers who were on the bridge at the time are missing and presumed dead — and one that will likely take at least several billion dollars to repair. In a small bright spot, the macroeconomic impact will likely be limited. (While Baltimore is the US’s 17th largest port and there will be some costs and delays, particularly around automobiles and coal , other ports will quickly handle rerouted container ships.) There is a reason, however, that economic concerns immediately spiked: The global shipping industry is having a bit of a rough time right now. International shipping traffic is being choked at two separate, vital points — the Panama Canal in the Western hemisphere and the Suez Canal in the Eastern — which combined account for more than half of the container shipping that links Asia and North America . And as awful as this Baltimore incident was, it was, by all accounts, a rogue accident. The root causes of these other disruptions, though? They’re not quite as easily fixed. Oh, plus pirates are back . Global shipping’s current problems, briefly explained The Baltimore incident encapsulates one thing really well: just how globalized the shipping industry is. The Dali was a Singapore-flagged ship , with an all Indian-nationality crew , operated by the Danish company Maersk and on its way to Sri Lanka . (Thankfully, there were no injuries reported among the crew of the ship.) This degree of interconnectedness — and how fragile it all is — probably feels familiar by now. Remember the wide swath of consumer goods that were subjected to back orders and shortages in 2021 as the global supply chain fell victim to a series of interconnected problems, including (but definitely not limited to) issues with container ships and ports? Or, more hilariously, remember the delays ( and memes ) the ship Ever Given spawned when it got stuck in the Suez Canal ? This year is shaping up to be another difficult one for global shipping. vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Subscribe Low water levels in Panama — the result of a prolonged drought that began in early 2023 — forced canal officials late last year to cut the number of ships that pass through each day from the normal 38 to just 24. That’s left some ships stranded for more than two weeks , and others taking costly roundabout routes; major shipping companies are even switching some freight to railroad “ land bridges ” across parts of the country. And in the Red Sea, the Houthis, a Yemen-based rebel group that controls much of the country’s north, have been waging an increasingly serious campaign of attacks against shipping , purportedly in protest of Israel’s war in Gaza . Ships are rerouting here, too, this time around the Horn of Africa , or facing the risk at added cost. At the start of this month, the Houthis sank a ship . And while the group is reportedly allowing safe passage to some ships — those affiliated with Russia and China — that’s not necessarily a foolproof guarantee . Between the two, prices for freight containers from Asia to the US have doubled over the last six months . Low water levels outside the Miraflores locks of the Panama Canal near Panama City, Panama, last November. Walter Hurtado/Bloomberg via Getty Images Can’t we fix this? It would be tempting to look at both of these issues and think, “Things will get better soon.” And in some ways, they will. “The industry is going to find medium- to short-term solutions against these particular obstacles,” Nikos Nomikos, a professor of shipping finance and risk management at Bayes Business School in London, told me. Take the Panama Canal problem: The cuts are, canal officials repeatedly say, a responsible adaptation to a particularly bad year. Droughts have happened before, and the weather phenomenon El Niño is exacerbating droughts throughout the Americas, with devastating consequences . But this isn’t just a bad year. There are systemic issues at play with no quick answers. Climate change is worsening extreme weather events around the world, including droughts. And that’s running up against another competing need. As Dulcidio De La Guardia, a director at the Morgan & Morgan Group in Panama, told the Latin American Advisor in February , “The lakes that provide water to the Canal are the same ones used to supply drinking water to the major cities of the country.” “And water consumption has increased more rapidly than forecasted due to population growth, and poor management, waste, inefficiencies and corruption at the state-owned water company,” he said. There are potential solutions, but no easy or immediate ones. And then in the Red Sea: While the Houthis might temporarily halt or reduce their attacks if a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas comes through, there’s no guarantee that they’ll stop altogether. That’s because, as one Yemeni analyst told my colleague Josh Keating , the attacks serve a lot of the group’s other aims, allowing them to “disrupt economic activity, extract political concessions, and bolster their standing.” Having achieved that, they show no signs of backing down, even in the face of Western military strikes. Moreover, this is part of a broader trend of increased geopolitical instability, all of which can impact — and increasingly is impacting — global shipping. See also: Russia blocking Ukrainian grain from transiting the Black Sea at times during that war, fears about how a war over Taiwan will affect the global economy, and more. What’s happening in the Red Sea, in other words, is symptomatic of something fundamental. The “principle of freedom of navigation is being challenged here,” Rahul Kapoor, the head of shipping analytics and research at S&P; Global Commodity Insights, told Bloomberg in December about the Houthis’ attacks . I’m not trying to be alarmist. Global shipping is a “resilient industry,” Nomikos told me. But countries’ militaries and international shipping companies alike are thinking and planning for more maritime disruptions . Customers, unfortunately, should too. Any disruption’s net result “will be an increase in the freight cost, either because you have more fuel consumption and longer transit times, or because you require a premium to compensate you for the risks that you face,” Nomikos said.

"2","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has named Nicole Shanahan , a Silicon Valley lawyer and ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, as his running mate in his 2024 independent presidential bid. Shanahan does not have political experience, but she has previously donated to Democrats, including President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign, and paid for the Kennedy campaign’s Super Bowl ad earlier this year. She founded ClearAccessIP, a company that uses AI to manage patent portfolios. Kennedy made the announcement at a campaign event in Oakland, California, on Tuesday. “Technology has been a lifelong passion for my future vice president,” he said in an address. “This is important because I also wanted a vice president who shares my indignation about the participation of Big Tech as a partner in the censorship, and the surveillance and the information warfare that our government is currently waging against the American people.” Naming a running mate doesn’t make Kennedy, an environmental lawyer with several controversial views and a storied last name, any less of a longshot candidate. Just like every third-party candidate before him, he’s unlikely to come anywhere near winning the White House. But he does have the potential to tip the election, though it’s not yet clear in which direction. Kennedy is currently averaging about 12 percent in the polls, according to RealClearPolling . Celinda Lake, a pollster for President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign who continues to work with the Democratic National Committee, said that’s a worrying signal for Biden, based on polling and focus groups her firm has been conducting that suggest Kennedy will pull voters from Biden. Clifford Young, who leads Ipsos’s global election and political polling risk practice, said it’s too early to be certain whether Biden or Trump stands to lose the most from Kennedy’s rise, but if he actually received such a large share of the vote, he has real potential to be a spoiler. Kennedy’s ability to seriously cut into either Biden’s or Trump’s chances of winning, however, is limited by his ability to get on the ballot in all 50 states, which will require amassing a lot of signatures in an effort that would cost millions of dollars before fast-approaching deadlines. His campaign says he has qualified in four states so far, including two key battlegrounds: Nevada and Arizona. The more states where he can get on the ballot, the more potential for chaos his presence in the race creates. Democrats are beginning to take that threat more seriously. “This election is going to be extremely close just like the last election, so every vote that does not go to Joe Biden is going to hurt Joe Biden, whether it goes to Donald Trump or to RFK. It’s all the same, and with the race this close, we can’t afford to lose any votes,” said Chuck Rocha, a senior adviser on Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-VT) 2020 presidential campaign. Who is RFK Jr.? It’s still very early in the election cycle, and many voters may not know much about Kennedy beyond his name — and they may not have heard what he believes. Some analysts think his support in the current polling represents more symbolic discontent from voters who dislike both Biden and Trump than a real commitment to supporting him as an individual candidate. “People are not paying attention,” Young said. “He’s filling a vacuum. And that vacuum is this disaffected voter vacuum. I think he’s a placeholder more than anything else.” Kennedy, who announced his candidacy in April, is the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy and son of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. For much of his life, he has been a scion for one of the most storied families in Democratic Party politics and backed Democrats . But his relationship with the Democratic political establishment has frayed. Disavowed by members of his own family , the previously celebrated environmental justice lawyer who helped clean up New York’s Hudson River now peddles false conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccine. While his primary bid against Biden failed to gain traction, his independent run has received the praise of prominent right-wing figures and Silicon Valley billionaires. His campaign is predicated on ending what he calls the “corrupt merger of state and corporate power that is threatening now to impose a new kind of corporate feudalism in our country,” he said in his announcement speech . He can sound more like a MAGA Republican than a Democrat. Kennedy himself has acknowledged that he holds controversial views. “I am not an ideal presidential candidate,” he said in his 2023 campaign announcement. “I’m not one of these people who said I have to be careful because one day I’m going to be in the White House.” Biden wouldn’t debate Kennedy or any other of his Democratic challengers, as is typical in a primary where an incumbent is running for reelection. But if he did, a debate would have revealed stark differences between them. Kennedy has become one of the leading voices of the anti-vaccine movement. He has pushed disinformation about vaccines since 2005 , when he falsely claimed that some childhood vaccines had dangerous levels of mercury that could cause autism, despite the fact scientists had already proven that mercury levels in those vaccines were not harmful and did not lead to autism . Some of his family members spoke out against his anti-vaccine rhetoric: “He has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines,” two of his siblings and his niece wrote in a 2019 Politico op-ed . But Kennedy’s profile nevertheless took off during the pandemic. He likened vaccine passports to the Holocaust in remarks at a January 2022 rally in Washington that he later apologized for, and that were even condemned by his wife, Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl Hines. In a bestselling 2021 book, he accused Anthony Fauci, former chief medical adviser to Biden and a member of Trump’s White House coronavirus task force, of using the pandemic to organize a “coup against Western democracy.” He also founded the nonprofit Children’s Health Defense, which has become one of America’s most influential anti-vaccine advocacy groups. Facebook and Instagram took down the group’s accounts but have since reinstated Kennedy’s personal account now that he’s running for president. Kennedy’s views might resonate with the quarter of Americans who were still skeptical of Covid-19 vaccines as of March 2023. But it’s out of step with the majority who have been vaccinated or plan to get vaccinated . Kennedy seems to recognize that gap and has largely refrained from discussing his views on vaccines on the campaign trail except in veiled references. Kennedy’s embrace of conspiracy theories, however, isn’t limited to vaccines. He claims that his father wasn’t killed by Sirhan Sirhan and has pushed for Sirhan’s release from prison, opposed by all but one of his seven siblings . He’s argued that 5G cellphone transmission towers are being used to “ harvest our data and control our behavior .” He claimed that Republicans stole the 2004 presidential election. He blames psychopharmaceuticals for mass shootings ; he says the CIA had a role in former President Kennedy’s assassination and that the agency could one day come after him . But despite Kennedy’s polarizing record, Democratic strategists are worried that some voters might be more inclined to support him simply because he’s a Kennedy. “Sure, he’s a crazy anti-vaxxer, conspiracy theorist, [rumored] steroid enthusiast , and tough communicator, but at the end of the day, his last name is still Kennedy, and I believe that will allow him to gain way more Democratic votes than Republican, so I think he hurts Joe Biden more than Donald Trump,” Rocha said. Why Kennedy could be a spoiler candidate Third-party candidates tend to poll much better than they actually perform on Election Day, when their supporters are confronted with the reality that their preferred candidate won’t win. What’s unusual this year is the sheer number of disaffected voters who don’t like either Biden or Trump and just want someone — anyone — as an alternative. Young said that, when Ipsos polls a theoretical no-name candidate as an alternative to Biden and Trump, that person gets about 10 percent. (That share is not far from Kennedy’s current level of support.) “We haven’t had a situation where we have had so many viable third-party candidates, and so many people who don’t like either [major party] candidate,” Lake said. In addition to Kennedy, the group “No Labels” headed by former Senator and Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Lieberman as well as the Green Party and the Libertarian Party have promised to name presidential tickets of their own. Cornel West, the progressive political commentator, is also running as an independent. Kennedy’s supporters span the race, age, and income spectrums, according to Ipsos’s polling . They are slightly more likely to be women and to identify as independents, leaning a bit more right than left and embracing more conservative economic policies but centrist stances on social issues, Young said. Lake said that in her polling and focus groups, about half of Kennedy’s supporters back him because they associate him with his father. Other Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, particularly young voters, embrace his credentials as an activist environmental lawyer. Young said it’s difficult to tell at this point whether that suggests that Biden or Trump is more likely to benefit from his presence in the race. “It’s going to confuse things. Things are going to get cloudy. I don’t think it’s so easy to say that he’s gonna hurt one or the other,” he said, citing Ipsos polling showing how his supporters aren’t strong partisans and how their views on particular issues are scattered. But Lake said that “it would take a real jiujitsu of people’s thinking” for Kennedy to hurt Trump. Accordingly, Democrats have sought to hamper Kennedy’s independent bid. The party recently established a team of lawyers dedicated to ensuring that he won’t make it on more state ballots if he violates complicated ballot access rules. But Democrats may also have to work to better define him as a candidate. Democratic primary voters’ initially net-positive impression of him became net-negative once they learned more about his positions through the primary process, and that could serve as a model, Lake said. “There would need to be a serious effort to define or reveal who he is,” she added. Update, March 26, 4 pm ET: This story has been updated with additional information from Kennedy’s announcement that he has picked Shanahan as his running mate. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Especially in the 1990s and 2000s, Diddy was a figure of enormous power, not just in hip-hop but in the business and entertainment worlds writ large. In recent months, however, multiple people have sued him , saying he used that influence and wealth to sexually victimize and, in some cases, traffic them, while avoiding consequences for decades. On Monday, speculation around the accusations escalated as homes in Los Angeles and Miami Beach linked to Diddy were raided by federal authorities , who revealed that the raids were linked to an ongoing investigation into sex trafficking allegations . Those allegations first came to light in a series of recent lawsuits, several of which include brutal and disturbing details. Plaintiffs state that Diddy — whose birth name is Sean Combs and who has also publicly gone by Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Love — raped them and, in some cases, trafficked them by coercing them to engage in sex with other men. Together, the cases have redirected public attention toward longstanding allegations of violence against Combs, leading some brands to cut ties with him and Hulu to scrap his upcoming reality show . The first suit , filed in November 2023 by the singer Cassie, who dated Combs and was signed to his label, alleged that he urged her to have sex with male sex workers while he filmed, and that he later raped her. In another complaint , a woman identified only as Jane Doe says that in 2003, when she was 17, Combs had her flown on a private jet to New York, where he and two other men gave her drugs and alcohol and raped her. And in a suit filed in February , music producer Rodney Jones Jr., says that Combs grabbed his genitals without consent and forced him to “solicit sex workers and perform sex acts to the pleasure of Mr. Combs.” Combs has denied the allegations , saying in a December statement , “I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.” After the February suit, a lawyer for Combs called Jones “nothing more than a liar who filed a $30 million lawsuit shamelessly looking for an undeserved payday.” The cases have captured the public’s attention in part because Combs was such an influential executive and gatekeeper in music and fashion, yet one who had long been the subject of allegations of violence, including arrests . They are among the first major allegations in years against a major figure in the music industry, which many feel has failed to reckon with abuses of power, even at the height of the Me Too movement. Combs is just one of many powerful men who have evaded scrutiny but whose alleged past conduct is being revisited with fresh and more critical eyes — in some cases thanks to the landmark New York laws that have allowed people alleging sexual abuse to file civil lawsuits past the time period specified by the statute of limitations. Indeed, Combs is now drawing comparisons to R. Kelly , with frequent critic 50 Cent announcing that he will produce a series about Combs in the style of the bombshell docuseries Surviving R. Kelly , with the proceeds going to assault survivors. Dream Hampton, producer of Surviving R. Kelly , told the Times late last year that an accounting was arriving for the Bad Boy founder. “Puff is done,” she said. The suits against Combs also show that despite recent backlash , the Me Too movement and the legal and cultural changes that came with it have had an enduring impact. Even if allegations of sexual assault and harassment do not make daily headlines the way they did in 2017, the reckoning is ongoing — and no industry is likely to remain immune forever. Diddy built an empire across multiple businesses Combs is a producer and rapper who rose to be an influential figure across music, media, and fashion. He started Bad Boy Records in New York in 1993, when he was in his early 20s, and soon signed Notorious B.I.G., whose two albums helped define New York hip-hop in that era. Bad Boy grew into a multimillion-dollar business , and Combs produced iconic ’90s acts from Jodeci to Mary J. Blige . When Biggie was killed in 1997, Combs released a Grammy-winning tribute, “I’ll Be Missing You,” which “helped inaugurate a commercial boom in hip-hop that lasted until the end of the nineties,” according to Michael Specter of the New Yorker . Combs was also one of the first to blend the worlds of hip-hop, business, and luxury. His fashion label, Sean John, founded in 1998, became known for high-end menswear . He promoted brands of vodka and tequila and hosted exclusive white parties in the Hamptons with guests like Martha Stewart. Though no longer as central a figure as he was in the ’90s, Combs remains a rich and well-connected celebrity: Within a span of weeks last fall, he held a joint album release and birthday party attended by stars such as Naomi Campbell and Janet Jackson, performed for a sold-out crowd in London , and appeared at the homecoming celebration for his alma mater, Howard University, where he made a surprise $1 million donation . Diddy pictured at a performance in London in November. Samir Hussein/Getty Images for Sean “Diddy” Combs As Combs built his empire, however, he was accused of multiple acts of violence. In 1999, he was arrested for beating another executive with a chair, a phone, and a champagne bottle; he had to pay a fine and take an anger management class, according to the New Yorker . The same year, he was involved in a shooting at a club in Manhattan, where he was attending a party with his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez; witnesses said they saw him with a gun, but he was ultimately acquitted after a public, much-watched trial. He has also been accused of threats and violence against women. In a 2019 interview , for example, his ex-girlfriend Gina Huynh said he had thrown a shoe at her and dragged her by the hair. But these reports have not received mainstream public attention — until now. Singer Cassie filed suit against Diddy in November In November, Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, sued Combs, alleging sexual assault and sex trafficking. In the suit, first reported by the New York Times , Ventura said she had experienced years of abuse from Combs, starting soon after she met him in 2005, when she was 19. She said that he beat her repeatedly, at one point kicking her in the face, and that later, in 2018, he raped her. She also said he trafficked her by coercing her to have sex with sex workers in different cities while he filmed and masturbated. She tried to delete the photos and videos afterward, but Combs retained access, she said in the suit, at one point making her watch a video she thought she had deleted. Ventura’s suit also said that Combs and his associates used his power and wealth to intimidate her into silence and compliance, with his employees threatening to damage her music career if she spoke out against him. In one particularly shocking detail, Ventura said Combs threatened to blow up the rapper Kid Cudi’s car because Cudi and Ventura were dating; the car later exploded. “This is all true,” a spokesperson for Kid Cudi told the Times of the car exploding. Singer Cassie, pictured in 2018 in Los Angeles, sued Combs in a case made possible by New York laws including the Adult Survivors Act, which opened a one-year window to file civil lawsuits in cases of sexual abuse, even if the statute of limitations had expired. Leon Bennett/Getty Images Through his lawyer, Ben Brafman, Combs accused Ventura of blackmail. “For the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Ms. Ventura’s persistent demand of $30 million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship,” Brafman said in a statement. “Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs’s reputation and seeking a payday.” Ventura’s lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, said Combs had actually offered Ventura money for her silence, which she had declined. Ventura’s suit was settled for an undisclosed amount within a single day. The singer stated that she had “decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.” But Ventura’s decision to come forward publicly opened the floodgates, and more reports of assault and abuse began pouring out. Other people say Diddy harmed them Three other women soon filed suit against Combs. In the second suit , Joi Dickerson-Neal says he drugged and raped her in 1991. In the third, Liza Gardner says that in 1990, he coerced her into sex and choked her, causing her to lose consciousness. Jonathan Davis, a lawyer for Combs, said in a statement to the Times that Combs denied these allegations as well: “Because of Mr. Combs’s fame and success, he is an easy target for accusers who attempt to smear him.” In the fourth suit , the woman identified as Jane Doe says she was a junior in high school when she met then-Bad Boy president Harve Pierre and another Combs associate in Detroit. They convinced her to fly on their jet to New York, the suit says, where they and the rapper gave her drugs and alcohol and then violently raped her. “Ms. Doe has lived with her memories of this fateful night for 20 years, during which time she has suffered extreme emotional distress that has impacted nearly every aspect of her life and personal relationships,” the suit says. “Given the brave women who have come forward against Ms. Combs and Mr. Pierre in recent weeks, Ms. Doe is doing the same.” In response to that suit, Combs released a statement denying all reports of violence, calling them “sickening allegations” made “by individuals looking for a quick payday.” Pierre has also denied the allegations, saying in a statement to TMZ , “I have never participated in, witnessed, nor heard of anything like this, ever.” The women came forward last year because two New York laws — one of which paved the way for E. Jean Carroll’s successful lawsuit against Donald Trump for sexual abuse and defamation — opened limited windows of time in which people can file civil lawsuits alleging sexual abuse, even if the statute of limitations has passed. One of those windows closed in late November, explaining the flurry of complaints. While the suits mostly describe behavior the plaintiffs say happened years ago, the February filing by Rodney Jones Jr., known as Lil Rod, says that Combs subjected him to unwanted touching and attempted to “groom” him when they worked together on The Love Album: Off the Grid in 2022 and 2023. Jones says that at a party in 2023, he was forced to drink tequila mixed with drugs, then woke up “naked with a sex worker sleeping next to him.” He says that Combs offered money and threatened violence to get him to solicit sex workers and perform sex acts with them. Combs has denied Jones’s allegations. In a statement, Shawn Holley, a lawyer for Combs, said, “We have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies.” In the wake of these civil lawsuits, raids in Los Angeles and Miami Beach in March have pointed to an apparent criminal investigation. According to the Times , the raids on homes connected to the rapper were part of an inquiry by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York and agents with the Department of Homeland Security. Few details were available in the immediate aftermath, and lawyers for Combs have not yet responded to requests for comment from Vox or the Times. However, the raids suggest a potential new level in the Combs case, with law enforcement sources also telling the Los Angeles Times they were linked to sex trafficking allegations. Combs was rumored to have left the country on Monday after his private plane traveled to Antigua, but he was later spotted in the Miami-Opa Locka airport . Regardless of his whereabouts, the investigations in Los Angeles and Miami Beach have once again placed the rapper under intense public scrutiny. Is this the music industry’s Me Too moment? The growing number of reports, and their chilling details, have led companies and influential people in media and business to distance themselves from the rapper. Diageo, the beverage brand with which Combs partnered on vodka and tequila, removed his image from its website. Capital Preparatory Schools, a New York charter school network Combs helped expand, posted a statement on the school’s website saying it was cutting ties with him (though the statement was later removed). Combs also stepped aside as chair of Revolt, a TV network he helped start in 2013. The cases against Combs are coming to light against a backdrop of other accusations against major figures in music. In November, a woman sued Neil Portnow , former head of the Grammy Awards , saying he had drugged and raped her in 2018. The same month, a former employee sued music executive L.A. “Babyface” Reid , saying he sexually assaulted and harassed her, leading to irrevocable damage to her career in the music industry. They also occur at a time when Ye , a music and fashion mogul whose career has parallels with Diddy’s, has lost many of his brand partnerships after public antisemitic and racist statements as well as what many say was a years-long pattern of verbal abuse and harassment, which may have been kept quiet in part because partnering with him was so lucrative for brands. While the Me Too movement forced reckonings around sexual assault and harassment in industries from film to other media to restaurants in 2017 and 2018, many in the music business felt that its biggest players were relatively unscathed. R. Kelly, for example, faced few consequences until Hampton’s widely watched 2019 docuseries drew renewed attention to the accusations — despite repeated allegations that he’d had sexual contact with underage girls, several lawsuits, and even a 2008 criminal trial over child sexual abuse material. Many argued that the reason Kelly was given a pass for so long was that the women coming forward to report abuse by him were Black. In 2021, he was convicted of sex trafficking and sentenced to 30 years in prison; a second 20-year sentence was added the following year, with all but one year to be served concurrently with the first sentence. Three women stated publicly in 2017 that another influential music industry figure, Def Jam Recordings co- founder Russell Simmons, had raped them. Like Kelly, he was the subject of a documentary focusing on the allegations, though he has not faced charges. Now, Ventura and the other people filing suit are reporting violent rape, intimidation, and abuse by one of the biggest names in music, someone who symbolized the movement of hip-hop into both mainstream and high-end culture. Combs in his heyday was an icon of power and influence in music, fashion, and business, and the lawsuits represent a new willingness to call that power to account. They also serve as a reminder that the Me Too movement has made enduring changes, including influencing law and policy and creating a road map for survivors of assault to come forward and share their stories. Update, March 26, 2:30 pm: This story, originally published on December 20, 2023, has been updated to reflect recent developments, including the federal raid of two homes connected to Sean “Diddy” Combs.

"2","The Supreme Court appeared listless, even bored, during Tuesday’s oral arguments in FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine , the case asking the courts to ban the abortion drug mifepristone . Their frustration with the Alliance case is understandable, since they’ve been dealing with it for nearly an entire year. Last April, after two lower courts issued decisions that would have effectively removed mifepristone from the market, the justices voted 7-2 to leave access to mifepristone intact while this case was being appealed. On Tuesday, it appeared likely that the justices would break down along the exact same lines — with only Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito voting to halt access to the drug. Broadly speaking, the Alliance case presents two separate legal issues. The first is whether the Food and Drug Administration erred when it took several steps, beginning in 2016, that made it easier for health providers to prescribe mifepristone. The plaintiffs faced an extraordinarily steep uphill climb to prevail on this issue. The Supreme Court has long said that a “court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of” the FDA when evaluating if a particular drug should be on the market. The only question judges may consider when evaluating the FDA’s decision is whether the agency articulated a “ rational connection between the facts found and the choice made .” In this case, the FDA looked at myriad scientific studies, collectively involving tens of thousands of mifepristone patients, when it determined how the drug should be prescribed. That’s more than enough to show a “rational connection” between the data and the FDA’s decision to expand access to mifepristone. Based on the justices questions on Tuesday, however, it seems unlikely that the Court will even reach the question of whether the FDA violated its legal obligations. That’s because the second question before the Court is whether any federal judge had jurisdiction to hear this case in the first place . Nearly all of the justices’ questions on Tuesday focused on this threshold question — a strong sign that the Court is inclined to dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds, without even getting into the question of whether the FDAviolated the law. That said, if the justices do rule on jurisdictional grounds, there is a high risk that this lawsuit will be revived in the lower courts and will wind up before the Supreme Court yet again. The plaintiffs in this case gamed the court system to ensure that this lawsuit would be heard by Matthew Kacsmaryk, a former anti- abortion lawyer who frequently acts as a rubber stamp for Republican litigants seeking a court order blocking a federal policy. Several of the justices suggested ways to dismiss the Alliance case that are fairly narrow. And, if the Court leaves open some possible way that this case could be revived, Kacsmaryk will almost certainly leap on it to try to ban mifepristone again. There does not appear to be much of an appetite for banning mifepristone among the current slate of justices, however. So, unless the membership of the Court drastically changes in the next couple years — such as if former President Donald Trump were able to replace several justices — it is unlikely that there will be five votes to ban the drug even if this case reached the Court again in the future. Most of the justices seemed to be looking for a way to make this case go away No plaintiff may bring a lawsuit in federal court unless they’ve been injured in some way by the defendant they are suing — a requirement known as “standing.” Moreover, if a federal plaintiff seeks an injunction, a court order that seeks to alter a defendant’s behavior in the future, they must show that they will be injured by that defendant in the future and that this injury is “ certainly impending .” It is not enough for a plaintiff to show that there is a high statistical likelihood that they will be injured in the future. That was the holding of Summers v. Earth Island Institute (2009), which rejected the idea that a membership organization can establish standing by demonstrating that “there is a statistical probability that some of those members are threatened with concrete injury.” Nevertheless, the plaintiffs in the Alliance case argue that they have standing to ask the courts to restrict access to mifepristone because there is a statistical probability that they might be injured in the future. The plaintiffs are anti- abortion doctors and organizations representing anti-abortion doctors. Specifically, they argue that if mifepristone remains on the market and can be prescribed under the FDA’s current protocol, some percentage of people will experience complications (serious complications from mifepristone are exceedingly rare but not nonexistent). These patients then might seek care from an emergency room. Once they arrive, they might be cared for by a doctor who belongs to one of the plaintiff organizations. And that doctor might have to provide care which violates the doctor’s conscience. That’s a whole lot of “mights.” And it is far too many mights to show that the conscience injury that plaintiffs fear is “certainly impending.” At Tuesday’s oral argument, various justices floated several theories why this case should be dismissed. Justice Elena Kagan, for example, honed in on the fact that Summers seems to preclude these plaintiffs’ lawsuits from moving forward, telling Erin Hawley, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, that her standing theory “sounded very probabilistic to me.” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson , meanwhile, worried that there is a “mismatch” between the specific harm alleged by these plaintiffs, and the sweeping remedy that they seek. If the plaintiff doctors believe that they may be required to provide care that violates their conscience, Jackson argued, then the proper remedy is to exempt them from having to provide such care. It isn’t a broad court order “preventing anyone from having access to these drugs at all.” Jackson’s concerns were echoed by Justice Neil Gorsuch, a conservative Republican who frequently votes with Thomas and Alito , but who already broke with them once when the Court handed down its temporary order allowing mifepristone to remain on the market last April. Gorsuch fretted that “a handful of individuals who’ve asserted a conscience objection” should not be able to go to court and obtain a “nationwide” order changing the entire country’s approach to mifepristone. Meanwhile, many of the justices suggested that, for these plaintiffs to have standing to bring their lawsuit, they would have to produce at least one doctor who identifies a specific circumstance where they will be forced to violate their conscience, and this doctor must also describe exactly what their conscience forbids them from doing. Two doctors did submit statements in this case indicating that they object to completing an abortion, and they fear that they would be required to do so if a patient shows up at an emergency room after they took mifepristone, but the drug did not succeed in terminating the patient’s pregnancy. But, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett pointed out, even among the small number of patients who require emergency care after taking the drug, most of these patients do not arrive at the ER with a live fetus. So its not clear that any doctor involved in this case has ever been asked to provide care that violates their conscience, must less that such a violation is “certainly impending” in the future. It appears very likely, in other words, that the Court will find some way to rule that this case should be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. The only question is how the justices will find their way to that conclusion. If the Supreme Court’s order is too narrow, this case could be back in a year or two Though the Court appears likely to dismiss this case, there is a significant risk that the case could be revived if the justices’ decision is too narrow. That’s because the trial judge in this case is likely to latch onto literally any opportunity, no matter how tenuous, to restrict access to abortions. Until recently, any federal lawsuit filed in Amarillo, Texas, was automatically assigned to Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee with close ties to the religious right, and a history of handing down dubiously reasoned decisions that advance right-wing causes. The Judicial Conference of the United States, an internal governing body for the federal judiciary, recently announced a new policy that is supposed to prevent this kind of “judge shopping” from happening in the future . But the new policy will not cause cases that are already assigned to Kacsmaryk to be reassigned to another, unbiased judge. Suppose that the Supreme Court rules that the Alliance case must be dismissed because the two doctors who described the nature of their conscience objections described them too narrowly. If that happens, the Alliance plaintiffs may try to revive their lawsuit by submitting new statements that describe those objections more broadly. Given Kacsmaryk’s record of doing whatever it takes to restrict access to abortion, he will likely rule that this case can be revived. Similarly, Kacsmaryk has already ruled that three red states, which tried to join this lawsuit months after it was filed , may do so. Unless the Supreme Court definitively rules that these states do not have standing, Kacsmaryk will almost certainly rule that they do. That would also revive the case, and most likely require the Supreme Court to hear it again at a later date. The Supreme Court, in other words, needs to decide whether they want this meritless lawsuit to continue for years, repeatedly being revived by a judge who is determined to do whatever he can to ban abortions — or whether they want to put this case to bed forever. The only way to ensure that it doesn’t come back is to hand down a broad ruling that cuts off any argument Kacsmaryk might use to revive it. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","What do the words “loo,” “condo,” “haw,” “hero” have in common? Unless you’re extremely into ornithology, it’s impressive if you were able to pick out the fact that if you added another letter to each of them, you’d spell the name of a bird. But if you’re a regular player of the New York Times game Connections , these four words have another significance: They make up one of the puzzle’s most notoriously tricky categories of all time. Connections — an often frustrating but integral addition to a morning routine that might also include the Times’s daily crossword, Wordle , and Spelling Bee , or offshoots like the geography quiz Worldle and the GDP guesser Tradle — debuted last summer. Over the past nine months, it’s become the second-most played game at the Times, after Wordle, but it’s captured social media in a way that a simple five- letter word-of-the-day puzzle never could. Connections is played like so: There is a four-by-four grid, and each box has a word in it. Your job is to group them into sets of four that make sense on levels that go from easy (say, synonyms or simply defined categories) to difficult (the bird one). When submitted, the easiest group will show up in yellow, the second-easiest in green, the second-hardest in blue, and the hardest in purple. @darasprivstory #greenscreen #nyt #connections #nytconnections #wordle ♬ original sound - dara You can see how this might make people feel angry or, as one woman posted on TikTok , like she’s “immediately ready to fight” the game’s editor. That’s because Connections, even more so than crosswords, whose difficulty ratings are usually made clear from the outset, or Wordle, which relies heavily on luck, has the unique ability to make people feel either really, really smart or really, really stupid. In a post titled “ Why NYT’s Connections makes you feel bad ,” game designer Raph Koster suggests Connections is “fundamentally elitist” because it requires players to have a broad education to find possible categories, and then punishes them for making guesses (players have only four tries before they fail the game). Some puzzles may be easier for certain folks — in order to know that “emerald,” “radiant,” “princess,” and “baguette” go together, you’ve got to have some knowledge of jewelry — and be extra difficult for those frustrated by potential overlap. One recent puzzle included five answers that could work for the yellow (easiest) category, “seen at a sports stadium”: “astroturf,” “jumbotron,” “scoreboard,” “skybox,” and “kisscam.” Only the last one works for the purple (hardest) one, which was “starting with rock bands.” But there’s no way to tell whether a puzzle will be easy or hard until you’re playing it — thereby leading to the kind of near- conspiratorial thinking and Connections shaming on Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok. Complaining on Twitter about how hard that day’s Connections was is a risk in itself, and it more often than not ends with other people smugly commenting how “ maybe word games aren’t for you ” and posting memes that tell the poster to “ take your sensitive ass back to Wordle !” They do have a point, however: The point of doing puzzles is to feel puzzled . https://t.co/Sn2IpGORCG pic.twitter.com/Gb6CrQh94a — zou bisou bisou where are you (@lilgrapefruits) February 27, 2024 According to Everdeen Mason, the editorial director of the Times’s Games section, these theories about Connections suddenly “getting harder” based on social media discourse are both hilarious and wrong — mostly. “We see everything, and we think pretty much all of it is funny,” she says of the people livestreaming their games and teasing each other over their results. “Connections in particular has felt really special, in part because of TikTok. I don’t know that any of our other games have really taken off in the same way. The game itself is pretty witty, and people can feel that and want to riff on it. It just makes it really memeable.” The idea that the Connections editor, Wyna Liu, changes the difficulty in response to social chatter is untrue — games are programmed about a month in advance — with the exception of one period last October, before the Connections team started using official testers. Testers, who are paid and selected by Games staff, are used for all Times games to help look out for potentially incorrect or offensive puzzles, or grids where there could be multiple correct solves. “There were a couple of weeks where the solve rates were really low, and we were like, ‘We need to do something about this.’” “It’s pretty much always the purple category that people are crankiest about,” Mason says. She points to the bird category and another purple set in February made of words beginning with instruments (“bassinet,” “cellophane,” “harpoon,” “organism”) as particularly frustrating for solvers. Of course, the frustration is part of the fun, and it’s why Connections was an immediate hit from its 90-day beta release last summer. Its full release, however, caused a small controversy because of its similarities to the British quiz show Only Connect, which also asks contestants to group a grid of 16 words into four sets of four. The game’s host, Victoria Coren, responded to the launch of Connections on Twitter, asking , “Do you know this has been a TV show in the UK since 2008?! It’s so similar I guess you must do?” The Times has denied copying the format. Connections is also, crucially, much easier to solve than Only Connect ’s grids, and audiences got obsessed quickly. It’s a similar story to Wordle, which debuted in 2021 and went viral in 2022, its characteristic colored block emojis making for the perfect shareable signature. More than that, Wordle avoids a common problem with games — playing too much too quickly and burning out — by only releasing a single game per day, which is also the model Connections and Spelling Bee use. None of these games has the power to take over your whole life in the way that, say, a super engrossing new video game might. And even though you’re technically only in competition with yourself, they’re fundamentally social games: Grids and scores are easily shareable online and make for solid conversation starters with pretty much anyone. Liu has responded to the conversations on TikTok by posting her tips on how to play. Most importantly, she says, don’t guess unless you’re pretty sure you have a category. Second, look for words that don’t belong anywhere else. Last, think flexibly — “my job here is to trick you,” she says. Games have been a hugely successful bet for the Times. The company told Axios that its puzzles, which were played more than 8 billion times in 2023 (including 2.3 billion Connections successes), have contributed to subscriber growth in a tough media market. Up next: a word search called Strands that’s currently in beta mode. Judging from the discourse it’s already sparked online , it seems to be yet another puzzle for solvers to argue about in comments sections and Reddit threads. In other words, a hit. Though the New York Times debuted and then shuttered the math game Digits last year, something about word games seems to stick. “It’s our main medium of communication,” Mason says. “They make people feel engaged and intelligent, but they’re also accessible. You can take something away: a new vocab word, a new perspective, new connections between things.” Personally, I’ll never look at the word “kisscam” in the same way again.

"1","T here’s a recent trend on TikTok that has women unfolding the massive sheets of warning labels that come with boxes of prescription birth control. The text, finely printed and covering both sides of a piece of paper the size of a small blanket, warns patients that they could experience severe side effects from taking the pills, including blood clots, depression, stroke, and even death. For the journalists over at the Washington Post , this trend is concerning because it is indicative of a growing sense of skepticism among young women surrounding hormonal birth control. Social media influencers, the Post claims, are using medical misinformation to wage a war that could have dangerous consequences in post- Roe America. Disappearing TikTok Clips Last week, the Washington Post published an article claiming that social media influencers like popular TikTok and Instagram star Nicole Bendayan and Daily Wire host Brett Cooper are “misleading” women about the dangers of hormonal birth control treatments. @brileeenour #pharmacy #prescription #bc #sendhelp ♬ Oh No – Kreepa Bendayan, who has openly shared her experience with birth control and the health care industry on her platforms and who advocates for naturally regulating women’s hormones, told the Post that she went off birth control after experiencing “a lot of really bad symptoms” that doctors dismissed. “Even when I asked if it had anything to do with birth control, they all said no,” she said. As Bendayan explained to the Post , it’s not that she believes no woman should ever take birth control pills or undergo some hormonal treatments; she just doesn’t “think we’re given informed consent.” (WATCH: The Spectator P.M. Podcast Ep. 34: IVF at 50 Is Not Pro-Life. It’s Anti-Family. ) Bendayan has since responded to the Post’s article on her Instagram page , calling it “one of the most disingenuous experiences that I’ve ever had” and expressing her disappointment that the Post had decided to use her as a “pawn” in its “political agenda.” “What I do is not a right or a left issue. It’s a women’s health issue,” she added. Unlike Bendayan, Cooper didn’t respond to the Post’s request for comment. In a video she posted Tuesday in response to the article, she said the Post had asked why a viral TikTok video in which Cooper argued that birth control can affect women’s sexual attraction had been removed. “It was news to me,” she said. It turned out the clip was removed after the Post asked TikTok what the company was doing to prevent the spread of misinformation. “A TikTok spokeswoman said the videos violated company policies prohibiting ‘inaccurate, misleading or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society,’” the Post article says. Don’t Question Birth Control As Cooper pointed out, the real problem is that media companies and medical professionals aren’t listening to the same women they’re claiming to protect. The Washington Post even admits that the profession has a “long-standing lack of transparency about some of the serious but rare side effects.” At least anecdotally, young women are becoming less and less trusting of a medical establishment that tells them they should be taking pills or undergoing treatments that unnecessarily alter their bodies’ natural rhythms — and with good reason. On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case about the FDA’s rapid expansion of access to mifepristone. Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents a group of pro-life doctors for the case, argues that the FDA’s decision in 2021 to relax requirements for women seeking a medical abortion was based on studies it later conceded “were ‘not adequate.’” (READ MORE: Can the Pro-Life Movement Rally Behind the Alabama Supreme Court’s IVF Ruling? ) “[T]he FDA attempts to argue that these drugs are safe … even as safe as Advil. That is false. The FDA’s own label states that roughly one in 25 women who take these drugs will end up in the emergency room. One in 25 women who take Advil do not end up in the emergency room,” ADF senior counsel Erin Hawley said in a press statement on Tuesday. While it seems possible that the Supreme Court could dismiss the case on procedural grounds, the case has made it obvious that the FDA is willing to jeopardize women’s health for a political agenda — something that should matter to young women and teenagers who’ve been told they should ignore the sheet of possible side effects and aren’t allowed to question why."
"1","O n Tuesday, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he had selected attorney Nicole Shanahan to be his nominee for vice president. Shanahan, a 38-year-old native of Oakland, California, is best known for having been married to Google co-founder Sergey Brin; the two divorced in 2022 amid rumors that she had an affair with Elon Musk. Both Shanahan and Musk have denied the allegation. In picking Shanahan, Kennedy is signaling his desire to broaden his appeal on the left. Shanahan is the president of the Bia-Echo Foundation , a left-leaning grant organization that focuses on, among other things, “addressing climate change and ‘global climate equality’ with regenerative agriculture.” It should come as no surprise that she describes herself as “progressive through and through.” She donated to several of the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential candidates, including Joe Biden. In her speech after the announcement, Shanahan announced that she was leaving the Democratic Party, arguing: “[It] is supposed to be the party of compassion. It is supposed to be the party of free speech, and most importantly, the party of the middle class and the American dream.” “While I know many Democrats still abide by those values,” she added, “I do believe they’ve lost their way in their leadership.” Why Shanahan? Shanahan is an unconventional pick, even for a gadfly-esque candidate like Kennedy. One could forgive even a zealous consumer of political news for greeting the announcement with a “ who? ” After all, Kennedy was reportedly considering some big names . Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard would have both brought experience in elected office to the ticket. NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers had star power and name recognition. There is, however, a method to Kennedy’s madness. Shanahan can provide something in abundance that the others cannot: money. Shanahan has already put that money where her mouth is. The Super Bowl commercial by the Kennedy campaign that deliberately echoed the famous 1960 ad by his uncle was paid for by her . But the first hurdle for Kennedy isn’t convincing Americans to cast their ballots for him; it’s getting his name on those ballots in the first place. In about half of states , presidential candidates must have a named vice-presidential nominee to appear on the ballot. Further requirements, which vary greatly by state, include the arduous task of gathering a sufficient number of petition signatures. Sometimes it is even necessary to go to court to contest state rulings. According to ABC News , Kennedy has already successfully sued Utah to push back its early filing deadline. He’s threatening to do the same to Nevada over a ballot access dispute. Kennedy has officially made the ballot only in Utah. He appears to have met the requirements in New Hampshire, Hawaii, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and South Carolina as well. Obtaining ballot access in all 50 states — an accomplishment that previous credible third-party bids, such as Ross Perot’s in 1992 and 1996, were able to manage — is reportedly a priority for the Kennedy campaign. Enter Shanahan, who pledged in her speech to “spend the next seven months getting Bobby Kennedy on every ballot in America.” That the Kennedy ticket won’t win likely goes without saying. But if he is able to take his case to voters everywhere, it could decide who does."
"1","I’m a hippie. I don’t think there’s anything more fun than growing my hair long, getting into a sky-blue Volkswagen Campervan with huge daisies painted on it, and driving across the country from coast to coast banging out ’60s tunes on a Spanish guitar. I drink wine from a carton, pee in park hedges, and have declared war on cologne. The only fragrance that satisfies me is the smell of freedom. I know that declaring wars isn’t too coherent with ’60s orthodoxy, but what can you do — one still has those reactionary twinges of youth. I have bought round sunglasses. I’ve thrown away all the bottles of expensive rum, except those from revolutionary countries, and I have a trunk full of liter bottles of beer. I wear the kind of torn and aged clothes that are worth a ton of money but give you a super-cool sloppy look. I listen to the Stones non-stop, which doesn’t have much to do with hippies, but I like it. And I’ve burned all the neat ’80s pop vinyls, the ones I used to put on during my morning shower, because they upset my fellow bobmarleys . There is no one more violent than a pacifist first thing in the morning before his first toke of marijuana. I smoke with a mouthpiece like Hunter S. Thompson because I aspire to be a hippie but an intellectual one, that is, instead of dying passed out in a wasteland, I will die with my head resting on a typewriter. My love of freedom prevents me from wearing leggings. And that is something else I have to admit. The oppression that leggings produce in the differential fact that distinguishes the male hippie from the female hippie goes radically against my concept of free will. It’s an old debate I have with my fellow hippies, who don’t see how they are to fight the oppressive enemy when the oppressive enemy is in their testicles. I’m a baggy-legged, airy- shirted hippie. I abhor all that tightness that exposes capitalist fatiness, to put it eloquently. I live in communion with nature, and my girlfriend is the ecosystem. That’s the sum of my thoughts on hygiene. When you believe sparrows are clean because they rub their wings in a puddle of mud every morning, and if you’re sure your kitty is neat because she scrubs her little paws with her tongue, then there’s really no need for a drugstore close to home. I don’t shower. I only bathe in the sea. Yes, every day. And then I take showers on the sly, of course. But don’t tell anyone, or my colleagues will force me to clean the trunk of the damn van. I’m a practitioner of natural medicine (huge quantities of beer), I read the strangest books in French (and without knowing French, which is doubly meritorious), and I display a kind of expansive love that especially encompasses all those hippies in their 20s who buy frayed denim shorts and white shell necklaces in the luxury boutiques around New York. In other words, I’m a hippie, but I’m a posh hippie, which is the trendy thing to do. Kind of like being a progressive in the Republican Party. The norm. I am, first and foremost, an intellectual. My lecture The Counterculture Speaks for Itself is receiving excellent reviews. The duration is two hours and the fee close to $5,000. It is a conceptual talk. During the two hours I just walk silently around the auditorium staring at each of the attendees. When the time is up, I leave. And the audience bursts into a resounding ovation. I have already been called from several countries to give this master class on counterculture. And in the summer I will go on tour. The truth is that it is quite easy to translate it into any language. And I’m sure that in Brussels I’ll find a lot of idiots willing to subsidize my tour with EU funds. I think the whole universe is good. At least, the universe of my campervan. I’m not interested in politics, like Maduro. I watch parliament sessions as if they were silent movies. In an artistic sense, I travel from psychedelia to counter-power and anti-war protest. Maybe that’s why my hobby is to raid abandoned military facilities to celebrate raves with my hipster buddies, who are not hippies but only by two or three letters. After the sixth rum and coke, nobody notices the difference. Least of all the hippies, who are too busy dodging colorful elephants on the dance floor. But I have a problem. I confess, with no shame, that I like the system. Yes, without the system I wouldn’t be able to spend my summers at hippie island resorts with my Silicon Valley buddies. And that’s just out of the question. I don’t intend to spend the whole year putting up with the stale aroma of that campervan to not be able to dance reggae with the hippie daughters of bankers and businessmen in summer. Bob Marley would understand perfectly. I have already said that I am a hippie, very hippie, a total hippie. But a classy hippie. Translated by Joel Dalmau.

"1","O n June 1, 2020, Heriberto Carbajal-Flores , a migrant illegally living in the United States, was found in unlawful possession of a firearm in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The charge falls under Title 18 of the United States Criminal Code, which makes it illegal for undocumented individuals to possess or purchase any firearm or ammunition. Two motions were previously made in 2022 by Carbajal-Flores to drop the charges, but both were denied. This month, a third motion for dismissal was granted by Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, who cited cited Carbajal-Flores’ previously clean criminal record in her decision. Additionally, Carbajal-Flores had stated to the court that he was in possession of the handgun for “self-defense,” as the city of Chicago and many across the U.S. had seen “civil unrest” following the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020 . Coleman asserted that Carbajal-Flores had a reasonable right to defend himself and his property from potential harm during this time. (RELATED: The Regime Attacks Chauvin Defenders ) When it comes to firearms, the U.S. is unique in enshrining its people’s right to keep and bear arms in law; it’s one of only 10 countries worldwide that have done so. This isn’t just the case for the Second Amendment, though; the United States’s entire Bill of Rights is distinctive in that it never uses the word “citizen,” implying that all who live in the country are entitled to those rights upheld in the first 10 amendments. “Citizen” rarely appears in the Constitution at all, its language falling instead to the use of words like “person,” “people,” or “individual.” The implication of this has been argued in many cases concerning non-citizens, starting with the 1903 landmark decision Yamataya v. Fisher by the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling stated that even those who have entered the country unlawfully deserve the same due process as citizens and legal residents. Throughout the years, Yamataya v. Fisher has been posited as a springboard to afford illegal immigrants increased constitutional protections. The Supreme Court’s 1982 ruling in Plyler v. Doe allows children of illegal immigrants access to “free public education,” for example. Coleman herself cited lower court rulings in her own decision to dismiss the firearms charges against Carbajal-Flores. The issue now stands that her ruling sets another new precedent: Illegal immigrants now have the same right to keep and bear arms as legal residents and citizens do. But should that be the case? If a citizen or otherwise legal resident of the U.S. were to be found guilty of breaking a law, specific rights he or she had as a law-abiding citizen would be temporarily or permanently revoked . This often includes the right to bear arms, depending on the severity of that person’s crime. Using the same basic logic of criminal prosecution and punishment, illegal aliens are guilty of breaking immigration laws and should, therefore, not be allowed certain rights that their law-abiding counterparts are granted. Furthermore, Colman’s precedent-setting decision comes as the country has seen a surge of illegal immigration at the southern border. Unlawful border crossings hit record highs in December of 2023, according to the Pew Research Center . Almost 250,000 migrants crossed the border that month alone. Since January 2021, nearly 8 million immigrants have illegally entered the United States. Those who illegally cross the border come with no vetting, no accessible documented past, and no criminal history. They can say and be whomever they want without a paper trail following them. It is not only unwise but downright dangerous to allow these individuals the legal protection to keep and bear firearms. A whopping 80 percent of Americans believe the government is “doing a bad job” at protecting the border. The same concern over the number of illegal border crossings should bleed into this issue. It is paramount to take a hard look at what protections illegal aliens are being afforded and how these protections are making the United States a more dangerous place in which to live for its law-abiding residents."
"1","Last Tuesday in Arizona, former President Donald Trump continued his 2024 domination of President Joe Biden in battleground states. So far this year, both parties have held primary elections in three of the six states that decided 2020’s presidential outcome. Trump has out-polled Biden in all three. Handily. While pollsters may give insights into how people will vote, primary voters offer outcomes as to how they have voted. Right now, it’s not close. Despite both men having already sewn up their nominations, each faced some drama in Arizona’s primary election. Biden faced a protest vote over his policy in the Israel–Hamas conflict. Trump still faced numerous challengers who garnered over 20 percent of the Republican votes. As in 2020, Biden won last Tuesday , this time gaining over 370,000 votes and beating his 2020 primary showing (in a then-crowded field) by over 110,000 votes. However, the overall Democrat vote dropped by over 200,000 votes from its 2020 level. In 2020, Republicans canceled their Arizona primary because Trump was the incumbent president and had the nomination locked up. Last Tuesday , he won over 490,000 votes, beating former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his closest challenger, by over four-to-one. Overall, Republicans received roughly 620,000 votes. In this year’s Arizona primary, Trump outpolled Biden by almost 120,000 votes. He also outpolled the entire Democrat field by over 70,000 votes. Overall, Republicans received over 200,000 more votes than Democrats. The significance here is that in 2020’s presidential election , Biden beat Trump in Arizona by just over 10,000 votes. Arizona marks the third time this year that Trump has beaten Biden in battleground state primary voting. Despite losing by over 115,000 votes, Arizona has been the closest Biden has come to Trump in any of these three: In Michigan , he was roughly 140,000 votes short of Trump; in Georgia , he was over 220,000 votes short. While Democrats will argue that in Michigan, Trump still faced a challenge for the nomination (of course, Biden faced a protest vote over the Israel–Hamas conflict then too), the race was over by Georgia and Arizona. In the last two primaries, the candidates have been on a level footing. Thus far in these three primary states, Trump has yet to lose to Biden. In total, he has outpolled Biden by over 450,000 votes — an average margin of over 150,000 votes. Why is this so significant? In 2020’s presidential election , Trump lost to Biden by roughly 150,000 votes in Michigan, by roughly 12,000 votes in Georgia, and by 10,000 votes in Arizona. How pivotal these states are in 2024 can be seen by looking back at 2020’s presidential election results. Although Biden won the popular vote by roughly 7 million votes and 51.3 percent to Trump’s 46.9 percent, the electoral vote was much closer: 306 to 232. The electoral votes of six states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Wisconsin — proved the difference. In 2024 , those six states will account for a combined 77 electoral votes. Because only 270 electoral votes are needed to win the presidency, and the states Trump won in 2020 gain three electoral votes, Trump only needs to flip 35 electoral votes from Biden to win this November. Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan’s combined electoral votes are 42. National polling showing Trump leading Biden is nothing new. According to RealClearPolitics, Biden has not led Trump (44.5–44.3 percent) in its average of national polling since Sept. 10 of last year. On March 26, RCP’s average shows Trump leading 46.6–45 percent. In RCP’s 5-way average , Trump’s margin is slightly larger: 2.3 percentage points. In the battleground states , Trump’s margin is 3.6 percentage points. However, these are just results in polls. The results in the pivotal battleground primaries — votes cast at the polls, not simple answers given in polls — are more solid. Yes, they confirm polling’s findings of a Trump lead, but they also tell us that Trump’s voters appear more motivated. For whatever reason, Trump’s are showing up; Biden’s are not. These are just one more indication that Biden has ground to make up. He is going to have to campaign hard in 2024 — versus hardly campaigning in 2020. The downside there is that Biden is poor in public. Under pressure, Biden could easily wind up hurting his chances further, even as he seeks to improve them. In other words: Things are worse for Biden than the “bad” that they appear now — and they very likely could get worse still. J.T.

"1","Last week, Max, formerly known as HBO, dropped not one but two trailers for the second season of House of the Dragon , a series based off of George R.R. Martin’s Fire & Blood . The show is a prequel to Game of Thrones , which aired its final season in 2019. Unconventionally, the two trailers ask viewers to “pick a side” in the battle for the throne between the “ Blacks ,” led by Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D’Arcy), and the “ Greens ,” led by her half- brother King Aegon II Targaryen (Tom Glynn-Carney), with the backing of his mother and Rhaenyra’s childhood friend, Queen Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke). This strategy telegraphs a noticeable and welcome shift from the first season of the show and suggests that politics will further recede in favor of the character-driven action and drama that has been the mainstay of Martin’s world of ice and fire. Franchise reboots and adaptations have been having a rough go of it recently. The Star Wars sequel trilogy and subsequent Disney shows have all felt soulless. The Wheel of Time and The Rings of Power were both mediocre. After a promising first season, Netflix’s The Witcher went off the rails. Even the latter half of Game of Thrones , especially its final two seasons, simply didn’t measure up to the rest. But House of the Dragon has stood out by performing remarkably well. It has deep, realistic characters, a plot that is both engaging and easy to follow, and phenomenal acting. Were there problems with season one? Of course. The season had some janky pacing, with months or years passing between episodes and some characters, like Ser Criston Cole, never seeming to age a day. Book readers wonder how Prince Daeron the Daring became Daeron the Disappearing. The callbacks to the main series just serve to remind everyone about how poorly it ended; after all, the long night wasn’t all that long, the realm didn’t need to be united to overcome it, and it just wasn’t anything worth worrying about . While not “strangled by wokeness” as some feared , House of the Dragon has thus far been incredibly reluctant to have any of its female characters do anything morally condemnable, at least on purpose. Princess Rhaenys Targaryen’s decision to murder thousands of peasants for no discernible reason doesn’t count because they don’t qualify as people anyway, and it looked cool, at least according to the showrunners. Alicent’s character was especially sterilized. Instead of believing that her children have a better claim to the throne than Rhaenyra’s “brood of bastards” and orchestrating the plot to crown her son, she’s shocked and outraged that the other Greens have been plotting to make him king. In addition, she thinks that Viserys wanted her son, Aegon, to be king because of some inconsistent and clearly delirious words he said right before he died. It just so happens that everyone around her was already planning on crowning Aegon anyway, so, because of this insane luck, she goes along with it. (The forced friendship between her and Rhaenyra is entirely an HBO invention that the show likely would have been better off without. When Alicent married King Viserys in the original story, she was 19 and Rhaenyra was only 9. Fire & Blood tells us that they got along well enough, but the age difference between them makes it hard to believe that they were truly friends.) None of it makes her look like a good person. It just robs the dowager queen of all of her agency and paints her as a gullible idiot. Now, in spite of the objectionable way the ball got moving, it’s careening down the hill. Its inertia necessitates that it smash into things in ways equally horrifying and entertaining, and everyone, man and woman, seems set to get their hands dirty. Battles will be waged, dragons will fight each other in stupendously expensive CGI scenes, characters you love will do horrible things and/or die when you least expect it, and there will probably be quite a bit of nudity. This is HBO, after all. One notable area where the show seems to be making amends for the last season — and heeding the advice of some smart critics — is in its treatment of the Greens and Aegon II. As the actor who played him worried publicly , the king claimant was made too evil too quickly in season one. Portraying him as a rapist who enjoys watching his bastard children participate in child-fighting pits was a conscious deviation from Fire & Blood that made any nuance going forward difficult. It was a too on-the-nose signal that you’re supposed to hate the guy. It appears, however, that this was a case of incompetence rather than malice. The writers have said: “ We are very sympathetic towards [Aegon] because we were very conscious that we didn’t want him to be Joffrey [Baratheon from Game of Thrones ]. He’s not a sadist . ” What is done cannot be undone, but season two seems set to let Glynn-Carney play a more dynamic, less cartoonish antagonist. Given how little he had to work with, he gave a phenomenal performance in the first season, and I’m looking forward to seeing more. People often read A Song of Ice and Fire as a liberal or deconstructionist critique of The Lord of the Rings . There is something to that perspective; Martin himself has said : “I look at the end and it says Aragorn is the king and he says, ‘And Aragorn ruled wisely and well for 100 years’ or something. It’s easy to write that sentence. But I want to know what was his tax policy, and what did he do when famine struck the land? And what did he do with all those Orcs?” But a paradox that nobody seems to have grappled with is that the world and characters are certainly not “woke” in any modern sense . Instead of a Manichean good-versus-evil narrative, Martin writes about the human heart in conflict with itself, about how most of his characters are not fully good or fully bad but instead shades of gray. His approach is more Dostoevsky than Rousseau. All the dominoes have been set up. Now, it’s time to sit back and watch how they fall. As the trailer puts it so eloquently: to war, then!"
"1","A h, the United Nations is finally reacting to the atrocities of Oct. 7! First, the UN cleaned house. Its United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, which has educated generations of Arab children to hate Jews and Israel, and whose employees participated in the rape, massacres, and hostage taking, has been completely reorganized and its criminal employees brought before the International Court of Justice for war crimes. Next, it used the combined power of the world’s nations to gain release of the hostages, who have been imprisoned, raped, and starved since October. It followed that by persuading the leadership of the ghastly atrocity romp to surrender to save the citizens of Gaza from suffering for their own sins as leaders. Finally, it exhorted the world to condemn and express with special horror using a religion’s holy days as a time to attack. Following this united stand of the international organization, Saudi Arabia announced it is signing a peace treaty with Israel and intends the partnership to spread abundance and peace throughout the once troubled region. Ha ha ha. The ghastly joke is on you. With Israel, ceasefires are only sought when Israel is defeating those who would exterminate it. Only non-Jewish holidays must be respected. War on Israel’s holy days are no problem. UNRWA will continue to teach hatred to children. There is no accountability for its collaboration in the war waged by Hamas against the lives of Israeli civilians and the bodies of Israeli women. It helped to kidnap hostages. Oh, the hostages. For the UN, should a ceasefire be conditional on releasing the surviving hostages? Naaah. And it all has the imprimatur of the Biden administration. Yes, he didn’t vote for the UN resolution, but that was weaseling — the abstention of a duplicitous, amoral leader to mask the enormity of what he chose not to stop, namely, the passage of a resolution as hateful and unbalanced as one issued by the Nazis or the Communists in their heydays. Biden’s goal was to maintain — for the willingly gullible and the acolytes of Obamaism — that we judiciously sit on the fence. He hopes that will not alienate more Jewish voters than he hopes to win in Dearborn by this cynical, duplicitous act. Biden’s gang — the Obamaites who run the government — really would like to keep Israel unable to defend itself and unable to bring about a real peace, as the resolute Israel–America alliance achieved with the Abraham Accords. The Obama infatuation with the mullahs of Iran would be over. Can’t happen. We really love people who hate America and Israel and plot for their utter destruction. Perhaps they revere them as the prophets of wokeism? In their policy, Israel should not defeat the perpetrators of the mass rape and murder — even though Hamas is the criminal party for using its citizens as shields, and for causing starvation by taking the food that has been shipped into Gaza for itself and then getting rich by selling what it doesn’t eat on the black market to desperate Gazans. And as the figurehead, Biden spouts out before the world nearly every lie issued by the Hamas mass rapists, from delusional casualty figures to accusations of Israel’s complicity in starving the population that Hamas wants dead as part of its war strategy. The Bidenites are trying to make sure that that strategy is successful. ***** These people do not represent the best of this country and the best of its history — to say the least. America’s relationship with its Jews began beautifully. President George Washington, replying to inquiries by the congregation of Newport, Rhode Island, about the place of Jews in America, wrote : All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship[.] It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support. America’s second president, John Adams, was a scholar with a deep appreciation of Israel’s contributions to the world and to the ideals to which America dedicated itself. He also had something to say about the possibility of the Jew’s return to Zion. Responding with his thanks to the gift of a book by its Jewish-American author, Mordecai Manuel Noah, an early advocate of the Jews’ speedy return to their historic homeland, Adams wrote , “I really wish the Jews again in Judea an independent nation.” But sometimes our leaders have not lived up to these great founders. In the last century, Franklin Roosevelt’s administration included Breckinridge Long in leadership at the State Department. America had a strict quota system even then for those seeking asylum from extermination. As the Nazi violence grabbed more and more of Europe’s Jews into its maw, Long wrote a memo to American consulates, telling them that, even for the very few openings, they were to “postpone and postpone and postpone the issuing of the visas.” In collusion with a British Foreign Office that worried more about Arab violence than the extermination of Europe’s Jews, FDR’s State Department made sure that only a very few Jews could escape the death camps to America. Dwight Eisenhower was president when Israel responded to continued terrorist attacks from Egypt by taking away the Sinai Peninsula to serve as a buffer for Israel’s civilians. In a decision he regretted much later, Ike sought to appease Egypt’s new dictator, Gamal Abdel Nasser, and, with severe threats , forced Israel to give the Sinai back without a peace treaty and to relinquish its hold there on the Straits of Tiran, which Nasser had used to choke off shipping to Israel’s port of Eilat — an act of war. The UN would put troops on the borders and at the straits. Israel had no choice, in the end. How did it work? Nasser chose to take what Ike offered but turned to the Soviets for an ally and to supply them with training and weapons to wipe out Israel once and for all. Nasser set that plan in motion in the spring of 1967, violating all the agreements he had made with Ike. Nasser demanded the UN troops should leave, which they did without delay, and Egypt promptly blockaded the straits in the opening act of war. Lyndon B. Johnson told a desperate Israeli prime minister not to do anything rash and promised nothing specific. No better was offered anywhere else in the world — certainly not by the UN. In 1973, Egypt showed the principled respect for holy days by launching a surprise attack on Israel on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur. Nixon had advance knowledge of Egypt’s plan but warned Israel not to preemptively strike. In the war that followed, it seemed for a week that Israel would be defeated and its citizens slaughtered or expelled. No calls for ceasefire resolution at the UN. But when, in the second week, Israel’s armed forces turned the tables, things changed. Egypt’s Third Army was surrounded, Israel’s army was in Africa, and Cairo lay in front of it when Henry Kissinger threatened Israel with an end to its supplies if it did not let the Egyptians go and so grab defeat from the jaws of victory. There’s more of this sorry history of American policy appeasing the aggressors and all that inevitably follows from such policies. Biden is only the most egregious of this chain, utterly oblivious to any standard of morality or international law save what might get him elected and what tickles the imagination of the wokists who are hell-bent on smashing American greatness from the inside out. There is a great difference, though, today. I was celebrating the Purim holiday yesterday and spoke with a mother and son here from Israel. The son is in Israel’s armed forces and studying here in Dayton at the Air Force Institute of Technology for two years. They are politically on the left, people who resolutely held out hope that even a group like Hamas could respond to friendly overtures and the lure of peace and the plenty that peace would bring to Gaza as the prosperity that Israel has gained. They are no less liberal, but they have no more illusions about the need to destroy Hamas utterly. In this, they realized as FDR did with respect to the Nazis and the militarists of Japan — liberal that he was, he would accept only unconditional surrender of the guilty warmakers. America is better than Biden’s administration. It doesn’t represent the best of who we are, and it turns away from what we ought to be. America will turn away from them. We will do what we must to win back as a nation our honor and our sanity."

"1","P resident Joe Biden said that he used to take the train across the Francis Scott Key Bridge in commuting from Delaware to Washington, D.C., in his statement addressing the disaster in Maryland . A cargo ship downed the third- largest truss in the world and has possibly claimed multiple lives . This horrible event should not be about Joe Biden. But the president cannot help himself, and the American people cannot help but notice. Why must he always insert himself into tragedies unconnected to his life? It feels not empathetic but narcissistic. In this instance, the fact that no trains crossed the Francis Scott Key Bridge compounds the ick. I-695 is a beltway circling Maryland, after all. Did he ride not the Acela but the “ Crazy Train ”? Like his claim a year ago that “[w]e have plans to build a railroad from the Pacific all the way across the Indian Ocean,” or his earlier boast of a long- retired and dead conductor congratulating him on over 2 million miles traveling on Amtrak, the president referencing “Francis Scott Key Bridge, which I have been over many, many times commuting from the state of Delaware either by train or by car,” bespeaks a captain not at the helm of the ship of state. Biden recalling conversations about Jan. 6, 2021, with long-dead world leaders François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl, or confusing the name of the young woman murdered by an illegal immigrant in Athens, Georgia, for the football coach at the University of Southern California, suggest creeping cognitive impairment. But long before his 80th birthday, the president bragged of his arrest in South Africa when trying to visit an imprisoned Nelson Mandela and repurposed Neil Kinnock’s life story as his own. Nobody blamed senility when he told bizarre whoppers in his 40s. The president seeks to turn lemons into lemonade in his upcoming campaign against a 78-year-old. “Look, I’m not a young guy,” Biden confesses in an ad running in select markets. “That’s no secret.” He looks to Ronald Reagan — 73 rather than 81 when he ran for reelection — who, when asked about his vigor during a presidential debate, answered : “I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” One grasps the rationale of the president’s handlers. Walter Mondale pointed to that quip as the all-hope-is-lost moment of his already quixotic campaign. But for the line to work, it required Reagan to take the risk of debating his opponent and to demonstrate his wit and sharpness in front of inquisitive — hostile, even — journalists and an audience of millions. Biden looks poised to become the first president since Richard Nixon to refuse to debate his opponent and even rebuffed the softball interview that presidents typically sit for during halftime of the Super Bowl. He dares not demonstrate wit for fear of appearing witless and squints his way to statements provided on a teleprompter. On Tuesday, he rolled over words, maybe the way his imaginary train rolled over the Francis Scott Key Bridge or in homage to the locals who drop a syllable when pronouncing Baltimore, to the point of incomprehensibility. So, what does the ad, which acknowledges the issue as Reagan did but runs from any demonstration of his mental fitness to overcome the issue, accomplish? About the same as these past presidential advertisements. “Look, I’m into interns slightly older than my daughter. That’s no secret.” “Look, I can’t walk. That’s no secret.” “Look, I’m so fat that I installed a bathtub in the White House. That’s no secret.” What? Those ads never ran? Maybe the advisers to those presidents thought the better of it. Maybe President Biden’s advisers should have thought the better of it too."
"1","“S tand up to an administration which is too male, too pale, and too stale ,” candidate Letitia James told supporters in 2018 when she ran for New York state attorney general. “Too male, too pale, too stale!” she chanted as the crowd roared. “Too male, too pale, too stale!” Imagine if a white Republican man were on the stump: “Stand up to an administration that is too fem, too tan, and too woke,” he might say, perhaps while running against James — a woman, black, and far-left Democrat. That speech would doom his campaign as it vanished beneath an avalanche of headlines and X posts calling him sexist and racist. He probably would apologize and then crawl into a snow drift until the spring thaw. But James’ sexist, racist remarks — shouted into a microphone, not whispered into a martini glass — caused her no political damage. Indeed, she was elected attorney general of the Empire State. James’ anti-white bigotry detonates a core tenet of Critical Race Theory, namely, that blacks are incapable of racism because they lack power over omnipotent whites. This self-enfeebling argument collapses in the face of James’ enormous police power, vast government resources, and ability to impoverish and imprison people she hates, not least a former president of the United States. James labors mightily to “get Trump,” which she promised to do, in a preemptive injustice that should get her disbarred. James’ political biases are on full display as she licks her chops and lusts after the real estate and financial holdings of Donald J. Trump. These could fall into her hands if Trump cannot post a $175 million bond by April 4. (An appeals court discounted that figure 61.4 percent on Monday from an initial $454 million .) That $175 million would let Trump appeal Manhattan Judge Arthur Engoron’s decision that Trump is guilty of defrauding his banks — even though he repaid all of his loans, with interest, and sometimes ahead of schedule. None of his lenders claims to have been swindled. Indeed, Deutsche Bank considered Trump such a profitable client that it wanted to lend him even more money . As Trump slips through James’ slithery tentacles, he should file an emergency motion in federal court today and request a preliminary injunction to halt all of James’ efforts to snatch his property, if not quash her entire case. Trump’s attorneys should invoke the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and justifiably accuse James of discriminating against him on the basis of sex and race. President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed this landmark legislation to shield Americans from hateful state laws and bigoted state officials. The act was designed to guard citizens from prejudiced mayors, governors, and — yes — attorneys general who would deploy local and state laws to deny them their rights. In Title VI , 42 U.S. Code § 2000d, the landmark law states: “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance ” (emphases added). According to § 2000d-4a , “the term ‘program or activity’ and the term ‘program’ mean all of the operations of … a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government.” New York state’s Office of the Attorney General (OAG) is an “instrumentality of a State.” As for “ receiving Federal financial assistance ,” the OAG has collected at least $234,723,442 since 2019, all on James’ watch. This sum was from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ Medicaid Fraud Control Units. These funds were dedicated “[t]o investigate and prosecute Medicaid provider fraud as well as patient abuse or neglect in health facilities and board and care facilities and of Medicaid beneficiaries in non-institutional or other settings.” “Engaging in discrimination based on sex and race should play no part in any prosecutor’s office or taxpayer funding from any level, including the nearly quarter-billion federal dollars that Attorney General James’ office has enjoyed for the last five years,” said Adam Andrzejewski, founder and CEO of OpentheBooks.com , which identified these subsidies. “James might respond that this money was earmarked to fight Medicare-related crimes. Never mind. Money is fungible, and $234 million flowed into her office, thanks to federal taxpayers.” James will have a much tougher time hiding from the largesse that the U.S. Department of Justice paid her office for clearly non -medical matters. The DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs furnished the New York State Division of Criminal Justice $77,055,947 in fiscal years 2021, ’22, and ’23. This included funds for substance abuse treatment, forensic science improvement, statistical analysis, and more. The Trump-hating Letitia James runs the OAG, which has received at least $311,779,389 in federal taxpayer funds, according to these two sources alone. These basic facts throw the Civil Rights Act of 1964 like a net over James and her state agency. What the hell does Trump have to lose? He immediately should file a federal complaint and demand justice under America’s keystone civil- rights law. To see a white male multi-billionaire sue a black female attorney general to secure his civil rights would be the ultimate man-bites-dog story. For this extraordinary spectacle, America owes a hearty thank you to New York state’s leading despot, Attorney General Letitia James. Deroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor."
"1","Last summer, Sound of Freedom surprised many with a massive box office success that opened many people’s eyes to the ongoing reality of child exploitation. Now, a hit show from Investigation Discovery reveals that some of those children suffering abuse aren’t as far away as we might have thought. The exposé docu-series Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV highlights the exploitative nature of kids entertainment in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The show signals out Nickelodeon, the first cable channel created for kids, which quickly rose to prominence after it was launched in 1979. “For a certain generation, the Nickelodeon jingle is burned into our brain,” explains former Nickelodeon actress Katrina Johnson in an episode of Quiet on Set . Nickelodeon took “kid everything” to a new level, creating a mini-Hollywood for kids centered around their own award shows, trophies, and red carpets. Marc Summers, host of the Nickelodeon stunt show Double Dare , says the channel was never concerned with educating its young audience; instead, it aimed to “have fun.” “In the mid-’90s, Nickelodeon was pushing the boundaries of kids entertainment,” says Kate Taylor, a reporter for Business Insider who was featured on the show. This approach evidently worked — Nickelodeon achieved massive popularity and even went on to significantly shape pop culture. As Quiet on Set reveals, however, the channel’s boundary-pushing went beyond the content. According to the docu-series, members of All That’s production team intentionally attempted to break down the relationships between the child actors and their parents, and Nickelodeon staff ignored the repeated harassment of female writers by favored producer Dan Schneider. Additionally, multiple sets were riddled with high-profile cases of sexual abuse , such as that experienced by The Amanda Show’s Drake Bell, who was assaulted by his dialogue coach . Unfortunately, as a recent United Nations report reveals, the problems highlighted by Quiet on Set are not limited to Nickelodeon or one era of filming but, rather, are “widespread” throughout Hollywood. The extent of the abuse has even caused the U.N. to call for “urgent action” to provide “improved protection for children and young people who go into show business.” This protection is necessary, the U.N. report explains, as children being subjected to grooming and other forms of sexual exploitation is considered “the norm” in the entertainment industry. Many of these children are trapped by fear, which prevents them from coming forward and telling their stories. This is exactly what happened on Nickelodeon sets. All That veteran Leon Frierson says the overt power dynamics on set often led him to act in ways that made him feel uncomfortable. “In the moments to myself,” he explains in one Quiet on Set episode. “I’d just be thinking that this is what we got to do to be on the show and stay in the cast and in the good graces of the people that were higher up.” Much of the abuse exposed by Quiet on Set happened under Schneider, who helped catapult the channel to success in the late 1990s and early 2000s with his work on All That , The Amanda Show , and other hits like Drake & Josh , iCarly , and Zoey 101 . Schneider not only harassed female writers; he also encouraged the inclusion of inappropriate content in shows intended for children as young as 6 years old. Lines intended as humor often contained sexual innuendos, and scenes hypersexualized the young actors. Schneider admitted the truth of many of these allegations in a video posted to YouTube after the docu-series’ premiere, calling his past behavior “embarrassing.” “Watching [ Quiet on Set ] … was very difficult with me facing my past behaviors, some of which are pretty embarrassing, and I regret, and I definitely owe some people a pretty strong apology,” Schneider confessed. “Look, I wanted to make funny TV shows for kids, and we definitely did that, but if I could go back, I would get it done in different ways.” Schneider is just one of many high-profile producers in Hollywood facing allegations of harassment or inappropriate behavior, joining prominent names like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein. Repeated experiences with abuse led to many child stars later engaging in self- destructive behaviors like alcoholism, drug addiction, and repeated criminal convictions. Quiet on Set directors Mary Robertson and Emma Schwartz have said they hope the success of the show will encourage other former child stars to come forward. “One of the goals of the series is to help spark a broader conversation around these issues. And I certainly know that there’s a lot more people with a lot more stories out there,” Schwartz told Us Weekly . “[W]e would love to be able to keep telling those stories if more people want to speak and share.” As Quiet on Set reveals, Hollywood has yet another dark side, one that harms the most vulnerable of society. Consumers should think twice about continuing to support it."
"1","I’ve discussed the “ hero’s journey of Donald Trump ” here in this column multiple times — and it turns out I couldn’t get away from it even if I wanted to. Every day we hear a drumbeat of evidence that the Left — the media- governmental-intelligence Deep State complex that has declared war on the entire world, with the free American people its primary enemy — has gone absolutely off the deep end. Villains gonna villain, y’all. And these villains are villaining like the clock is running out on them. I’ll get the destruction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge over Baltimore Harbor out of the way first because I expect that some of the ubiquitous Democrat trolls in the comments will want to assume it’s part of this discussion. It isn’t really, at least not yet, though there are some manifestations of the theme in the reaction to the bridge going down thanks to a rogue container ship crashing directly into one of its uprights early Tuesday. For example, there is Joe Biden, who could not help himself but to lie about his personal connection to that bridge : At about 1:30, a container ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which I’ve been over many, many times commuting from the state of Delaware either on a train or by car. I’ve been to Baltimore Harbor many times. And the bridge collapsed, sending several people and vehicles into the water — into the river. What marks the lie here? How about the fact that you can’t take a train over that bridge. It has no railroad tracks; it’s just a four-lane roadway. (RELATED: Biden’s Strange Story Collapses in Bridge Collapse Presser ) Why is it necessary for this quintessential political troglodyte to force himself onto every news hook possible as though each were somebody’s kid whose hair he just had to dig in and get a snootful of? Biden promised that the federal government would pay to rebuild the bridge. Why would you make that statement before we even know the actual cause of its destruction, Dirty Joe? The official word is that the ship hitting that bridge and knocking it down was an accident. Perhaps so, but video of the incident appears to show the ship losing power, regaining it, and then losing power again before smacking directly into that stanchion: We don’t know anywhere near enough about why that ship lost power, and, until we do, nobody ought to say much of anything about responses or consequences. It could be that someone out there owes a lot of money to rebuild that bridge. Like the shipping line or … whoever had a hand in that ship losing power. Why put the world’s largest debtor on the hook for the bridge before any of those ground balls have been run out? It’s a little suspicious. It makes one think of Victoria Nuland, another one of our Deep State villains, and her little speech about how funding Ukraine makes “asymmetrical warfare” against Russia — meaning Russian economic and industrial infrastructure — more possible. It also makes one think about the Netflix movie Barack and Michelle Obama executive-produced back in December. The first scene in Leave the World Behind that indicates something has gone horribly wrong has an oil tanker bizarrely go to ground directly on a beach in the Hamptons. At least in the movie the ship didn’t knock down a major bridge and close one of America’s biggest ports indefinitely. (RELATED from Scott McKay: Leave the Obamas Behind, Please ) There are suspicious things, and then there are terrible things. Speaking of which, let’s get this one out of the way as well, because I just … can’t. I didn’t think it was possible to be more awful than Michelle Obama, but then Jill Biden is the very definition of an AWFL, isn’t she?: Jill Biden equates banning gay porn in schools to Nazi Germany, claiming Berlin was the center of LGBTQ culture in Europe. pic.twitter.com/fACn9IbkBS — MRCTV (@mrctv) March 26, 2024 Another terrible thing is this : President Joe Biden is currently considering granting amnesty to illegal migrants in a bid to act on the worsening immigration crisis, according to Politico. Biden and his administration are weighing several ideas to take a tougher stance on the southern border crisis and illegal immigration amid criticisms he has thus far failed to act on either. The administration could start dolling out green cards to illegal immigrants who have long stayed inside the United States, thereby giving them amnesty to stay in the country, three people familiar with the planning told Politico. The plan would grant migrants who have been in the country for more than 10 years access to the cancellation of removal program provided that they have relatives who would suffer if they were deported, according to Politico. Migrants could then receive a green card — a permanent residency grant — if they meet the cancellation of removal requirements and an immigration judge rules in their favor. Ace of Spades had the correct take on this when he noted the blistering bad faith inherent in these unilateral amnesties: Everytime Biden or Democrats talk about “fixing the border,” they immediately talk about simply making it legal to illegally cross the border. There. It’s fixed. They’re not illegals anymore. And they act as if they have responded to our demands in good faith, and offered us a real solution which we are just rejecting out of partisan spite. But the contempt isn’t just for regular Americans, though we are undoubtedly the Great Satan to the Deep State mullahs. Just like the other cheerleaders for the apocalypse that today’s Left can’t get enough of, Israel is the Little Satan. Yesterday here at The American Spectator , Shmuel Klatzkin covered the latest example of this — Biden’s unsuccessful (thanks to the clearer heads from Russia and China ) U.N. security resolution seeking a demand for a ceasefire in Gaza: Biden’s gang — the Obamaites who run the government — really would like to keep Israel unable to defend itself and unable to bring about a real peace, as the resolute Israel–America alliance achieved with the Abraham Accords. The Obama infatuation with the mullahs of Iran would be over. Can’t happen. We really love people who hate America and Israel and plot for their utter destruction. Perhaps they revere them as the prophets of wokeism? In their policy, Israel should not defeat the perpetrators of the mass rape and murder — even though Hamas is the criminal party for using its citizens as shields, and for causing starvation by taking the food that has been shipped into Gaza for itself and then getting rich by selling what it doesn’t eat on the black market to desperate Gazans. And as the figurehead, Biden spouts out before the world nearly every lie issued by the Hamas mass rapists, from delusional casualty figures to accusations of Israel’s complicity in starving the population that Hamas wants dead as part of its war strategy. The Bidenites are trying to make sure that that strategy is successful. It’s mind-boggling to think that Joe Biden and his handlers are trying to use the U.N. to force Israel into surrendering when Hamas is still holding American hostages . One would think those Americans, or their corpses, would have to be turned over before there could be any discussion of our involvement in creating peace talks. And why are we demanding ceasefires in Gaza but not in Ukraine? Interesting question, that. Oh, but there is more. For example, this : Two groups are running a “misleading, unsolicited mass mailing of pre-filled voter registration forms targeting Alabama mailboxes,” according to an alert from Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen. In his warning , Allen says his office has “officially discouraged” the mailer, which is in no way affiliated with the state. Perhaps it’s no surprise that left- wing groups founded by an old Clinton family friend are behind the effort. According to the secretary of state’s office, the Voter Participation Center and Center for Voter Information have said they intend at least two rounds of mass mailings. “On two occasions, this Office was contacted on behalf of Voter Participation Center and Center for Voter Information regarding a mailer they planned to send to Alabama citizens,” Allen said in the alert . “In response, I strongly discouraged the group’s plan to mass mail our citizens.” According to activist tracker InfluenceWatch, the Voter Participation Center (VPC) was launched in 2003 as Women’s Voices Women Vote , before expanding its mission and changing its name nearly a decade later. Why Alabama? Democrats aren’t winning any elections there. It’s because they can, that’s why. And if this villainy has to be defended in Alabama, that fight eats up resources that would be better used in swing states. Back to Team Biden, because it still represents the most concentrated villainy on the planet. Remember how Dirty Joe likes to say it’s Republicans who want to “defund the police” because there are calls, and rightly so, to break up the corrupt FBI? Here’s how much the Biden gang likes cops: Karine Jean-Pierre reads a prepared statement from her binder when asked if Biden has plans to ""acknowledge"" fallen NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller during Biden's visit to NYC. She won't even say the fallen officer's name. pic.twitter.com/qIMOTNDqVU — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 27, 2024 Oh, wait — we’re not done with presidential spokeslesbian Karine Jean-Pierre: LISTEN: KJP hangs up on a Charlotte, North Carolina radio host after being asked if Joe Biden has dementia and about high gas prices and high grocery prices. pic.twitter.com/eu69qAQhVH — Conservative War Machine (@WarMachineRR) March 26, 2024 But perhaps we are done cataloguing the villainy of the Left for one day. There is only so much outrage one can stand, after all. And they know this. They count on it. They push more aggressively on more fronts than any political entity since the Chinese Cultural Revolution. That’s why it’s necessary to turn them out of power as thoroughly as possible this fall, even if the Republicans are woefully inadequate to the task of rolling back this black cloud of villainy covering the fruited plain."
"1","T he slate of “parent’s rights” bills that swept through red-state legislatures over the past three years may have seemed innocuous enough to the average observer; in fact, even the most controversial of the bills proved to be broadly popular with the American public. But left-wing writers saw more malign motives lurking under the hood. Jamelle Bouie was one such writer. Her March 2023 New York Times column, ominously titled “ What the Republican Push for ‘Parents’ Rights’ is Really All About ,” warned readers of the movement’s nefarious intent to undo progress, empower reactionaries, and “undermine public education,” among numerous other evils — an argument that was almost indistinguishable from the hundreds of other columns to the same effect. But in between a recitation of the conventional progressive script, Bouie briefly happened upon a kernel of truth: “‘Parents’ rights,’ like ‘states’ rights,’ is quite particular. It’s not about all parents and all children and all the rights they might have.” This was, of course, exactly right. But it wasn’t liberal readers who needed to hear it. The fact is that neither the parents’ rights movement nor the conservatives who support it are really devoted to parents’ rights, at least as abstract concepts, even if they may be personally convinced that they are. In truth, they are devoted to certain parental rights in certain contexts and staunchly opposed in many others. This is good and just; only an ideological fanatic would support the unmitigated and absolute exercise of a particular right in every time, place and venue. “Circumstances,” Burke wrote , “give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing color and discriminating effect.” (READ MORE from Nate Hochman: The Censorship Lobby Is Worried About … Censorship? ) Bouie’s argument comes to mind in light of a recent piece from Brad Polumbo, a libertarian writer at the Washington Examiner : “ Ron DeSantis just betrayed his promise to champion parental rights .” This betrayal, according to Polumbo, revolves around the Florida governor’s decision to sign a commonsensical — and, in many ways, long overdue — bill restricting children’s social media usage: Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) has long positioned himself as a champion of “parents’ rights,” and that pitch is a huge part of his broad appeal to the public. But the Florida Republican just signed a bill into law that betrays those promises. The new law is supposed to protect children from the alleged harms of social media. It does this in two major ways: by outright prohibiting Floridians under age 14 from having social media accounts and requiring that 14- and 15-year-olds obtain parental permission before they can have a social media account. Polumbo’s argument, in and of itself, is largely unremarkable, following the same essential logic as every other libertarian argument: “It is not the government’s job to [X]” — without any further consideration of exactly what [X] is , or what the government’s intervention would really do, or what the material effect of either intervening or not intervening would be on the collective (a word that raises every true- believing libertarian’s hackles) well-being of the nation. But while entirely unconvincing on the merits, the attempt to hoist DeSantis with his own “parents’ rights” petard helps to illustrate an important contradiction written into the so-called parental rights movement. On the left, similar allegations of conservative hypocrisy are a common affair. Bouie’s column was one such example, pointing out that parents’ rights “never seems to involve parents who want schools to be more open and accommodating toward gender- nonconforming students,” nor “parents who want their students to learn more about race, identity and the darker parts of American history,” nor “parents who want schools to offer a wide library of books and materials to their children.” Analogous arguments have been mounted in regard to GOP bans on youth sex changes: “The rule does seem to be that we are for parental rights when parents make decisions we agree with, and when they make decisions we don’t agree with, we outlaw them,” said Georgia state Sen. Elena Parent, a Democrat, in response to her state’s ban on gender transition surgeries and drugs for children. In this case, both Polumbo and his left-wing counterparts have a point. No one, least of all conservatives, truly believes in absolute “parental rights”; in fact, in the abstract, many of the initiatives championed by the parents’ movement — i.e., bans on sex-change surgeries — actually restrict parental freedom. What we’re debating, in these contexts, is not really parents’ rights at all, but rather a vision of what society is and should be. The disagreement is over not the scope and reach of parental rights but to what end those rights are used. (READ MORE from Nate Hochman: The Melting Pot Myth Is Destroying America ) Conservatives would be well-served to understand and embrace this rather than to retreat into the warm, comfortable fog of abstraction. We have a vision of what a good society looks like, and we would like our laws to both reflect and encourage that which we think is good — and discourage that which we think is bad. Our vision includes the parental right to object to obscene material in classrooms; it does not include the parental right to mutilate children’s bodies. That’s because we are for good things and against bad things — preserving childhood innocence is good , and mutilating children is bad . Too often, conservatives are loath to speak the language of morality at all, opting instead for amoral frameworks that, in turn, corrupt their political understanding. This is visible in the facially absurd concept of “cancel culture,” as I noted in the American Mind back in 2021: [T]he problem with cancel culture is not simply that some opinions are seen as socially unacceptable, but that our standards for what those opinions are have shifted radically to the left. Conservatives should be seeking to move those standards rightward, not seeking to abolish them altogether in favor of a libertarian “live and let live” morality. The idea that the right can only ever be intellectually consistent in its critiques of cancel culture if it never enforces its own standard of social morality is a gross perversion of the “liberty” that is often invoked as the basis of such arguments. It is true, to be sure, that there is an inextricable (though by no means absolute or all-encompassing) link between freedom, properly understood, and virtue — not least in the realm of the family. As the conservative sociologist Robert Nisbet wrote , a hostility to the traditional family — and an ensuing intervention against it on behalf of the state — is a consistent feature of totalitarian societies: “The shrewd totalitarian mentality knows well the powers of intimate kinship and religious devotion for keeping alive in a population values and incentives which might well, in the future, serve as the basis of resistance.” What was “essential” for totalitarian, Nisbet argued, “was the atomization of the family and of every other type of grouping that intervened between the people as society and the people as a mindless, soulless, traditionless mass. What the totalitarian must have for the realization of his design is a spiritual and cultural vacuum.” As Nisbet alludes to, the “mediating institutions” that sit in the space between the state and the individual — the family, the church, the community centers, parochial schools, and so on — are the basis of civic virtue. For those institutions to flourish, the political regime must allow them a wide sphere of freedom. In this sense, parental freedom is a cornerstone of a good society. But the “freedom” is the means; the “good” is the end."
"1","A mid the myriad challenges that confront us in the coming months, it’s easy to simply pigeonhole African issues under the heading of: “We’ll get around to it, someday, maybe.” That, as I’ve noted previously in writing about Africa , has been our customary way of approaching such issues, at least until they become too big and pressing to ignore, by which time they also have become much harder to address and less possible to solve. Consider the way in which African problems now present themselves at our southern border. Officials in Tijuana, Mexico, express themselves as “baffled” at a recent surge in Africans arriving trying to enter the U.S., by some reckoning a fourfold increase in 2023 alone, or more. Mexico’s Interior Department recently offered year-end figures showing that from 2022 to 2023, the number of African migrants arriving in Mexico increased from 6,672 to 59,834 . And there is little indication that most of these migrants view Mexico as their final destination. Why this dramatic increase in such a short period of time? Some analysts contend that, as the overall profitably of people smuggling increases, traffickers have worked hard to make the hitherto daunting passage through the Darién Gap, the infamously horrifying jungle region at the Isthmus of Panama. But in many instances Africans are responding to a now widely advertised workaround by paying a premium to fly into Nicaragua, thus avoiding the Darién Gap altogether. It’s worth noting, in this connection, that the Nicaraguan regime is notably unfriendly with the U.S. and little inclined to discourage this, instead choosing to profit. How do the migrants afford it? One Senegalese migrant testified that “relatives in New York had paid for his passage.” Considering the massive volume of remittances flowing from migrants already in the U.S. to their home countries, one can only suspect that this is quite common. Why the drastic increase in the flow from Africa? The New York Times predictably suggests that it’s the result of those nasty European countries showing more hostility toward African migrants and erecting more effective barriers. Anyone who pays even the slightest interest to Europe’s ongoing inability to deal with the migrant flood will quickly recognize this as the usual progressive misdirection. No one, after all, should suggest in any way that Biden’s open borders regime is to blame for any fresh aspect of the crisis at our border. A better explanation lies in the aforementioned “pull effect,” that is, once members of a given community become established, legally or illegally, in the U.S., it becomes more attractive — and affordable — for their friends and relatives to afford the journey. This is, unfortunately, almost impossible to measure, but remittances to Africa may rise into the billions annually. In some respects, of course, one could count this as a good thing, a form of foreign aid paid by migrants rather than out of the U.S. Treasury. But when the money flows to countries beset by serious problems, it’s unsurprising that it becomes the means for financing the rising tide of illegal immigration. Sadly, the problems appear to be growing rapidly, and the solutions that would encourage potential immigrants to stay home appear to be diminishing. Consider the case of Mauritania. Although slavery was officially abolished in Mauritania in 1981, in practice it remains widespread (would that Nikole Hannah-Jones might have paid attention to this reality rather than indulging in performative fantasies about the past). Although formally illegal, the Arab element that controls the government of Mauritania still treats black Mauritanians as little better than slaves. Black Mauritanians fleeing Mauritania for the U.S. are among those who’ve discovered the route through Nicaragua . Last August, I wrote of how the then-recent coup in Niger had comprehensively undermined efforts by the U.S. and France to prevent Niger from returning to its previous role as an entrepot for illegal immigration. As of just this month, relations between the U.S. and Niger have gone from bad to worse, as the Niger junta has revoked a military accord with the U.S. that not only was designed to help deal with Islamist terrorists in the region but also remained the last foundation for rebuilding cooperation in the area of illegal immigration. Without such cooperation, cutting off illegal immigration at the source becomes immeasurably more difficult. The deteriorating situation in the eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of Congo (a name, sadly, that reeks of irony) also promises to push yet another surge in migration. A long-simmering pattern of violence involving the Congo and Rwanda — and, somewhat tangentially, a variety of different African “peacekeepers” — now has become open warfare. In a region where the memories of the 1994 genocide of more than 800,000 Tutsis is still fresh, the prospects for total destabilization, mass killings, and a refugee disaster grow more urgent every day. It’s tempting to just simply dismiss all this amid all the other crises we face , but we do so at our own peril. Not only are African problems showing up on our border in ever more dramatically increased numbers, but we also must contend with how our enemies exploit African instability to our international disadvantage. We’ve already seen how South Africa has placed itself most firmly in Putin’s camp and developed warmer relations with China and Iran , recently lending itself to pro-Hamas maneuvering at the U.N. When South Africa participates in war games with the Russian navy, we should take notice. Think losing free passage in the Red Sea to the Houthis is to our disadvantage? Try compounding that if shipping also has to give the Cape of Good Hope a wide berth. And the Chinese navy also chose to participate in these war games. Wherever Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping work in concert, we have every reason to be concerned. (RELATED from James H. McGee: We Should Stop Exploiting Africa — And Start Caring ) China, of course, has used its “Belt and Road” initiative to achieve economic penetration in a number of African countries. And, despite Putin’s recent public disavowal, the takeover by Russian military intelligence of the former Wagner Group’s widespread assets and influence in Africa provides multiple avenues for leverage at a time of retreat by U.S. allies and indifference on the part of the administration in Washington. There are those who contend that our declining position in sub-Saharan Africa is of little moment, and that arguments in favor of maintaining our (surpassingly small) military presence in the region are little more than another example of Pentagon empire building. They are wrong — not least because, in spite of recent token efforts, no element in this administration, not the Defense or the State Department, certainly not the office of the president, has shown the slightest genuinely consistent interest in Africa. We can comfort ourselves with the notion that none of this matters, but the evidence suggests it does. It’s already bad enough that our open border has meant access for Chinese and Venezuelan special operators, Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists, and a lethal flood of fentanyl and the gang- related violence it promotes. Should we then also turn a blind eye to an increasing flow of illegal immigrants for various African conflict regions? One of the signature efforts of the previous administration lay in working with the countries that were the sources of illegal immigration to stem the flow — should we just abdicate these profitable influence operations when it comes to Africa? Should we simply yield to the Russians and the Chinese control of the immense natural resources found across the African continent? The good news is that the Chinese have, in a number of cases, already overplayed their hand, leaving African governments more wary even as they try to navigate away from Chinese clientelism. The Russians have a knack for making themselves unloved — the “Ugly Russian” bears more than a passing kinship to the once notorious “Ugly American” of the early Vietnam era. At this juncture, we still have the means to rebuild our influence in Africa, and we can do so without massive effort or expense. Many African countries would still prefer working with us, and these are relationships we can build on. Moreover, many Africans, in contemplating the long journey to our border, are still daunted by the danger or the expense. Making the journey more unappealing involves finally, and decisively, implementing measures to physically secure our border. It necessitates making it harder for illegals to remain in this country. It means rooting out the people traffickers, directly attacking their operations, and making their business unprofitable. Finally, it involves working closely with source countries to address the drivers for immigration. In some instances, this will simply be a bridge too far — the cultural, political, and economic drivers will simply be too great, such as the legacy of slavery in Mauritania. But helping African initiatives, for example, to contain the war in the eastern Congo should scarcely be beyond our remit. We can’t do any of this, however, if we don’t take Africa seriously, if we don’t start paying attention. Right now, given our blinkered pundit class and our blind existing leadership, that simple first step seems like a very tall order indeed. James H. McGee retired in 2018 after nearly four decades as a national security and counter-terrorism professional, working primarily in the nuclear security field.

"1","A s a libertarian, I accept that any relatively free society will tolerate certain disreputable business models and inadvisable personal choices. As a general principle, adults should largely be free to make their own decisions, even if they’re unwise. And prohibitionist policies just send destructive behaviors — drug use, prostitution, loan sharking — onto the black market. We tolerate such things even though we understand these practices usually harm those who willingly engage in them. Consider it one price we pay for relative freedom. But what should we do when these practices destroy the lives of innocent bystanders ? In particular, I’ve been thinking about payday lenders — those less-than-ideal lending companies that offer short-term small loans and charge obscene interest rates. It’s not unusual for annualized percentage rates to exceed 400 percent or even 600 percent in some places. No one in their right mind — or who isn’t in desperate financial straits — would consider loans at these terms. It’s legal usury . Lenders collect absurdly high levels of interest, taking advantage of the predicament of the borrower. Those who take out these loans can quickly find themselves in a deep pit of unpayable debt. The lenders obviously know they are lending to the highest credit risks, so they charge sky-high interest rates and fees to cover the risks. It’s the ugly underbelly of the financial world. Hitting up payday lenders for a few hundred bucks to make rent probably is better than losing one’s apartment. It’s certainly better than seeking the services of the neighborhood loan shark , who comes to collect with a crowbar rather than a regulated debt-collection agency. That it serves a need is its best defense, although far from any kind of endorsement. California places lending limits and interest caps on payday lenders to protect borrowers. But none of that protects the rest of us. Payday lenders generally don’t run credit through major credit bureaus. Therefore, they are susceptible to identity thieves, and victims don’t get notice of fraudulent new loan apps because these lenders don’t use the bureaus. Their lax standards leave everyone — even those of us who would never do business with such firms — vulnerable. Last year, my health care provider was the target of a massive data breach . I’ve since been victimized by fraudsters who have repeatedly applied for credit cards, loans, and bank accounts in my name. It’s been stressful, unsettling, costly, and time consuming. Alert emails from financial institutions have ruined many a nice evening. It just doesn’t stop. Identity theft is a sad reality of modern life. The U.S. Department of Justice reports that nearly 24 million Americans have been victims in the past year. That’s not payday lenders’ fault, of course, but they are the weak link in the financial chain. After I learned of the breach, I locked my credit at the three major credit bureaus so that no one could open a loan. But fraudsters are clever. I then started receiving applications for accounts with the online financial services company Chime — the same company recently hit with a $2.5 million fine from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation for its customer-complaint handling. (Based on my repeated calls to their customer-service department, I’d say that fine isn’t nearly enough.) Chime is not a lender, but fake accounts can abet money laundering and other financial crimes. Then fraudsters started applying for online payday loans in my name. It started as a trickle. I’ve since been inundated with perhaps 150 emails and numerous calls from cheesy loan companies asking me to complete my loan application. I tracked down a pending fraudulent loan, but now it’s Whac-A-Mole . Regularly, dozens more come into my inbox. I’m not sure which are actual fraudulent loan paperwork, phishing expeditions, or low-rent marketing emails. I thought my credit was secure because of my credit freezes, but because payday lenders don’t rely on credit apps with the bureaus, there’s virtually nothing I can do to stop it. “The easiest way to stand out from the crowd for payday loan companies? Offering fast, frictionless lending,” wrote Bence Jendruszak of SEON Technologies. “As you can imagine, this is the perfect opportunity for fraudsters. Faster credit scoring means fewer verifications.” Identity theft victims in these cases are at the mercy of whatever standards these lenders do or don’t have. I’ll no doubt have to spend months trying to clamp down on applications, lest I be stuck with payday loans in my name at interest rates that can pile up in a hurry — and the resulting legal battles. There’s no government agency or private credit bureau that can help. I can’t possibly track down all the potential loan apps. Because one sector of the lending industry doesn’t seem to follow responsible practices , the identity theft epidemic will continue unabated. Again, as a libertarian, I wouldn’t ban payday lenders no matter how distasteful I find them. But the California Legislature could, say, require them to run applicants through a major credit bureau (thus providing an alert if someone applied for a fraudulent loan). This would at least protect the rest of us from becoming collateral damage to this shady business model. Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute.

"2","On March 2, just as it was rounding the northern tip of Denmark, an oil tanker called the Andromeda Star collided with another ship . Thankfully, the 700,000-barrel capacity Andromeda Star was empty at the time, as it was making its way to Russia to pick up oil for export. If it had been on its way back, its cargo hold full of crude, a little-noticed maritime incident might have become a much bigger story, one that connects to both the ongoing war in Ukraine and the world’s unbroken dependence on oil. The Andromeda Star is part of what has been called the “shadow fleet” transporting Russian oil to world markets. This fleet emerged in response to the international sanctions slapped on Russia’s oil industry in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, to reduce the profits from its most valuable international commodity. The commodities trading company Trafigura has estimated the size of the fleet at around 600 ships, though some estimates are much higher . The shadow fleet is of growing concern not only because of the revenue that these oil shipments bring to Moscow, which fuels its more than two-year-old war, but because of the nature of the ships themselves. “They tend to be older, they may also be less well maintained, they are run by less experienced crews, and they carry less insurance than they should,” Erik Broekhuizen, head of tanker research at Poten & Partners, an oil and gas consulting firm, told Vox. The 15-year-old Andromeda Star was a relative spring chicken by shadow fleet standards. “The lifespan of a ship is typically 20- to 25-year range, but most reputable ship owners typically sell ships around 15 years,” said Broekhuizen. “In a normal market, they’d then be recycled.” But the shadow fleet has created a booming market for old tankers, including many that are over 20 years old. The average age of tankers departing the Russian Baltic Sea port of Kaliningrad is now close to 30 years old . That makes it more likely that the ships have fallen into poor conditions and makes them more prone to accidents. Another shadowy aspect of Russia’s new fleet: Often no one is quite sure who the ships belong to. The Andromeda Star’s owner is not listed on public databases . It is managed by Margao Marine Solutions, a “one-person company” based in Goa, India, which did not return an email from Vox seeking comment. And as with many shadow fleet ships, it’s not clear what if any insurance it was carrying. As this week’s disaster in Baltimore — where a Singapore-flagged cargo ship caused the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge — showed, the question of liability and responsibility can be messy even in maritime accidents involving one of the world’s largest and most reputable shipping companies. The nightmare scenario many governments are now contemplating is that one of these shadily owned tankers could be involved in a major oil spill and there would be no one — or at least no one authorities can track down — liable for the clean-up. “There is an ecological disaster waiting to happen. That’s just the reality,” David O’Sullivan, the European Union’s sanctions envoy, told Vox during a meeting with reporters in Washington last week. “This is something the international community needs to worry about.” Unfortunately, given the often murky multinational structure of the shipping world, it’s also something that the international community has few good options to address. The Russian oil compromise The emergence of the shadow fleet is one result of the dueling prerogatives of the international sanctions response to Russia’s war in Ukraine: One, cut the money flowing to Russia’s government and military; two, avoid major disruptions to a world economy that still relies hugely on the flow of oil. Shortly after the invasion in 2022, the US banned imports of Russian oil, which the US already wasn’t buying much of. But the EU has also slashed its purchases of Russian oil , which is a lot more significant: Before the war, the bloc accounted for about 45 percent of Russia’s oil exports. Now, it’s about 5 percent . Initially, the EU had planned to also enact a ban on European companies trading and shipping Russian oil, in order to prevent other countries from buying it, but the US government was concerned about the effect this would have on global oil prices. (A similar dynamic has emerged in recent weeks with reports that the US has pressured Ukraine to dial back its aerial attacks on Russia’s oil refineries, which are also having an impact on global prices by reducing supply.) According to one analysis from just after the invasion, disrupting Russia’s seaborne exports with the kind of strict sanctions that, for instance, the US has applied to Iran in the past, could have pushed global oil prices to over $200 a barrel, more than twice their current level. So, a workaround was found. A coalition of Western countries including the EU and the G7 implemented a “price cap” which allowed Russian oil sold below $60 a barrel — about $20 below the current market price — to use Western shipping infrastructure and insurance. The goal, as the US Treasury Department defined it , is to “limit Kremlin profits while maintaining stable energy markets.” To some extent, this system has worked. Russia’s oil exports, by volume, are back to where they were before the war . New customers in China , India, and Turkey have made up for the loss of the European market. (Thanks to some creative accounting, some oil has even reportedly found its way into the US military’s supply chain .) Russia’s oil revenues, though, have declined significantly . A recent analysis by the American Enterprise Institute estimated that the discounts may have cost Russia around $50 billion in lost revenue in 2022 and 2023. That’s almost a quarter of what Russia has spent on its military operations in Ukraine according to a recent US estimate . The thing is, experts say only a small fraction of Russia’s oil exports — maybe 20-30 percent, Broekhuizen estimates — are complying with the price cap. Russian oil is currently trading around $72 a barrel , which is below global averages but above the cap. This is where the shadow fleet comes in. These types of shadily registered ships meant specifically to skirt oil sanctions aren’t new, said Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has written extensively on the fleet, but the involvement of the world’s second-largest oil exporter was a game changer. ​​”This was a strategy that was initiated long before Ukraine for other sanctioned countries,” Braw told Vox. “ North Korea has been conducting a shadow economy using vessels that don’t officially exist for years. Venezuela and Iran have as well. But Russia’s involvement was a sort of quantum leap that brought this economy out of the shadows.” Trouble at sea “For the first time in many decades, safety at sea is becoming worse, not better, and it’s really because of the shadow fleet,” Jan Stockbruegger, a political scientist specializing in maritime security at the University of Copenhagen, told Vox. The Andromeda Star incident was far from the first or the most troubling incident involving shadow tankers. The most dramatic and deadly took place in May of last year, when the Pablo, a 26-year-old tanker, exploded in Malaysian waters , killing three crew. Thankfully, the Pablo had already offloaded its cargo in China, but with no apparent insurance and no reachable owner, the wreckage of the ship remained stranded until Malaysian authorities finally towed it to a scrapyard . As documented in a recent Atlantic Council report , shadow fleet ships have had to be rescued in the Bay of Gibraltar, have run aground near the Chinese port of Qingdao, and have drifted for days after losing power in Indonesia . Last August, when an Indian seafarer disappeared from the tanker where he was working, transporting Russian oil to India and Turkey, his family complained they couldn’t get basic information about his disappearance from the ship’s Dubai-based manager. In a confluence of two geopolitical crises, a Panama-flagged, India-affiliated ship carrying oil from Russia was attacked by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea in January. The Houthis have vowed not to attack Russian or Chinese ships as part of their ongoing campaign to disrupt trade between countries linked to Israel , but in this case may have been thrown off by the fact that the ship had a UK owner until a few months prior. Troubling as all these incidents are, they pale in comparison to what would happen if one of these ships, most of which carry insurance that, as the Financial Times has put it, would be “ impossible to claim against ,” was involved in a major oil spill. A combination of the country where the spill takes place and an international organization known as the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds , which reimburses victims of oil spills when the damage exceeds what the shipowner or insurer is able or willing to pay, could be left with responsibility for the mess. Other factors compound the risks. Last September, Bloomberg reported that two aging shadow fleet tankers had carried out a risky ship-to-ship oil transfer off the coast of Greece, having turned off their transponders to conceal their location. The majority of the ships transporting oil through the Danish Strait, a narrow and often tricky waterway as the Andromeda Star learned, have been refusing to take on the specialized Danish navigators that often assist ships making the journey. Often these ships refuse any contact with Danish authorities, a break from what was common practice pre-war. Russia has been keen to increase the use of its Northern Sea Route through the Arctic to China, including authorizing shipments by tankers that don’t have the reinforced “ice-class” hulls normally required for the trip. Even in summer, in the era of global warming , Arctic ice can be unpredictable, and using these thin-hulled tankers only increases the risk of accidents that could devastate a vulnerable ecology. Out of the shadows What can be done to crack down on the shadow fleet? “We are trying to shut off the supply of these tankers to make it more difficult for people to sell end-of-life tankers to the Russians,” said O’Sullivan, the EU sanctions envoy. “We’re also trying to be tougher in the enforcement of the documentation which needs to go with [these sales.]” In February, the US slapped sanctions on Sovcomflot , Russia’s largest shipping company and a leading operator of oil tankers, which prompted India to halt oil shipments from the company . But many of Sovcomflot’s tankers have already been transferred to offshore companies. Dubai, famed for its political neutrality and lack of income taxes , has been a particularly popular location for these companies. The US has also been sanctioning these companies and individual companies for violating the price cap. The US government has also been ramping up pressure on the countries where these ships are registered, which are responsible for ensuring safety and maintenance standards on the vessels that fly their flag. As a result, Russia’s oil fleet has been shifting away from popular flag countries like Liberia and the Marshall Islands . The number of ships flying the flag of the West African nation of Gabon, on the other hand, has surged dramatically since the beginning of this year. (The ill-fated Pablo was among the shadow fleet tankers flying the Gabon flag.) Mongolia, more than 400 miles from the nearest ocean, has also become a popular flag of convenience . The Financial Times also reported last fall that the EU was considering plans under which Denmark , which controls the straits at the entrance to the Baltic Sea through which 60 percent of Russia’s oil exports pass, could be given the task of inspecting or even blocking ships that were not found to be carrying recognized insurance. “The most practical step would be for coastal states to essentially assess every vessel planning to sail through their waters,” said the Atlantic Council’s Braw. “It would be extreme and very time-consuming.” It could also prompt retaliation or legal challenge from Russia. The plan has not yet been implemented, though the incident with the Andromeda Star may give it some new momentum. Stockbruegger suggests that another strategy would be to make it more appealing for officially registered and insured global shippers to participate in the Russian oil trade, under the price cap. But given the risks involved and the arcane nature of sanctions laws, which could leave them exposed to legal difficulties, “It would take a lot of convincing for these companies.” Assuming that countries like India and China won’t stop buying discounted oil — and given that the US doesn’t actually want them to, particularly heading into an election year — the continued existence of the shadow fleet in some form may be inevitable, even as these ships bounce around from flag to flag and owner to owner and port to port. A world that is rapidly dividing politically, even as it remains economically interconnected, has created some murky backwaters, including one that a fleet of mysteriously owned, aging rustbuckets has rushed in to fill. For now, Russian oil continues to course through the world’s economies, just as Russia’s adversaries intended. Hopefully, it will stay out of the world’s oceans. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Sam Bankman-Fried , the founder of the defunct crypto exchange FTX who was convicted on fraud and conspiracy charges last year, will be sentenced Thursday in New York court. Prosecutors are seeking a 40- to 50-year sentence for his role in defrauding investors of billions of dollars. Yes, billions. That sentence would still be well below the maximum statutory sentence of 115 years , but his attorneys are arguing that it should be no longer than six- and-a-half years and that he also should not be ordered to pay any restitution or forfeit any assets. His trio of co-conspirators Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh — all members of SBF’s inner circle and executives at FTX or Alameda Research (its sister hedge fund also co-founded by Bankman- Fried) — cooperated with prosecutors to testify against Bankman-Fried at trial. They may face minimal, if any, prison time. The judge in the case, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, is likely to consider a few factors in determining Bankman-Fried’s sentence, including his age, the scale of the losses, and the government’s interest in deterring him and anyone else from committing similar crimes. That last point is a big one, said Jennifer Taub, a professor at Western New England University School of Law focusing on white- collar crime. “The white, wealthy, and well-connected tend to wiggle their way out of facing the criminal consequences for their predatory behavior,” she said. “It’s high time that we actually hold white-collar criminals accountable.” While Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have sought to downplay the harm caused by the scheme that led to FTX and Alameda’s downfall, prosecutors have likened his crimes to that of Bernie Madoff , the infamous Wall Street financier who orchestrated history’s largest Ponzi scheme. “No scheme to defraud since Madoff can be compared to this one in terms of its size, scope, and amount of loss,” prosecutors argued in court filings . So how does SBF’s possible sentence likely stack up against other big fraud cases this century? Let’s take a look. But first, a recap of what went down with FTX SBF’s fall from grace was excruciatingly abrupt. As my colleague Sean Illing wrote , “Before he was charged, SBF was widely seen as a benevolent genius, some kind of digital-era Robin Hood, who was going to make obscene amounts of money and then give it all away to worthy causes.” (Disclosure: In August 2022, Bankman- Fried’s philanthropic family foundation, Building a Stronger Future, awarded Vox’s Future Perfect a grant for a 2023 reporting project. That project was canceled.) To back up: In 2019, Bankman-Fried founded FTX, at one point the third largest crypto exchange, and rode a crypto boom for a few years. Through the next few years, he went around espousing a particular version of effective altruism — a utilitarian movement that describes itself as “using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible” — that entailed earning as much as possible to purportedly give away as much as possible. He also grew his political influence , becoming one of President Joe Biden’s biggest donors in 2020. But in 2022, a balance sheet for Alameda was leaked that implied his whole crypto empire was built on double-dipping. Without getting too in the weeds, essentially the balance sheet showed that Alameda had large holdings of FTX’s proprietary digital currency FTT, which had questionable value at a time when crypto prices were spiraling downward. If those digital tokens’ value plummeted, FTX’s financial solvency would be severely in doubt. Investors withdrew their holdings in FTT in large numbers, revealing an $8 billion gap in what FTX could pay out and what it owed customers. It then became apparent that FTX had transferred customer funds to Alameda and that the two firms were far more entangled than Bankman-Fried had previously disclosed or that was allowed under their terms of service. Both FTX and Alameda declared bankruptcy that fall. Prosecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried’s failure to disclose the transfers, FTX’s relationship with Alameda, FTX’s exposure to Alameda’s risky FTT holdings, and the use of commingled funds to make “undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations” was in fact fraud. In November, after a much-watched trial filled with jarring testimony — including from SBF himself — he was convicted of all seven criminal counts against him. Those included two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Now, he’s facing potentially decades in prison. The factors that could influence his sentencing Bankman- Fried is only 32 years old, which means he would likely still be alive (and able to commit another crime) by the time he gets out of prison if the sentence is on the shorter end of the spectrum. He’s proved to have “gone up to the line over and over again,” as Kaplan said when revoking his bail ahead of trial, accusing him of trying to influence key witnesses. But he also has a lot of life left to live, this is his first offense, and his lawyers cite his neurodiversity and charity work as potential mitigating factors, which may make the court more lenient. Kaplan is “going to have to figure out whether he thinks there is an opportunity for this guy to be rehabilitated,” Taub said. “I think it’s a big deal, even though you’re trying to deter him from hurting other people, you’re trying to deter other young crypto people.” Prosecutors argue that the losses in the case are enormous, conservatively estimated at $8 billion for FTX customers, $1.7 billion for FTX investors, and $1.3 billion for Alameda lenders. Those total customer losses represent the amount by which their account balances exceeded the amount of assets that FTX had available to disburse to them when it went bankrupt in November 2022. However, Ellen Podgor, a professor at Stetson University focused on white-collar crime, said that the fact that Bankman-Fried’s fraud could cause such harm represented a regulatory failure and that the sentence sought by prosecutors is therefore too high. “The thing that bothers me the most about this case is that if [Bankman-Fried] had been caught earlier, the fraud would not be as great and the sentence lower,” she said. “I question whether a fraud that goes on for a longer period of time, because it was not stopped by a government agency, should place the defendant in receiving a higher sentence.” And Bankman- Fried’s lawyers say that the customer losses should actually be calculated as “ zero .” The Financial Times reported that customers are slated to receive up to two-fifths more than the value of their holdings on the day FTX went bankrupt due in part to the recent crypto surge. However, prosecutors argue that any potential recovery of funds after FTX filed for bankruptcy shouldn’t be considered in the sentencing decision. In other fraud cases, the government was able to recover a large portion of victims’ funds — in large part because of the justice system. In Madoff’s case, victims have been repaid 91 percent of their losses and there are ongoing efforts to make them whole; he still received what was a life sentence and died in prison. “The question is whether Judge Kaplan is going to consider the fact that the victims will are going to receive all their money back,” Taub said. “Will that affect the sentencing? I don’t think it’s going to be persuasive.” How SBF compares to this century’s biggest convicted fraudsters Bernie Madoff Prosecutors argue that the scale of Bankman-Fried’s fraud has no recent parallel but Madoff’s. Madoff orchestrated the biggest Ponzi scheme in history, with losses totaling $64.8 billion. He was convicted in 2008 after confessing to his two sons who reported him to law enforcement, and sentenced to 150 years in prison. He was once a respected name on Wall Street who embraced computing innovations in trading. But he lured in, at first, friends and acquaintances from Manhattan and Long Island to invest in his fund and later, large institutional investors, universities, and major charities. He used funds from new investors to pay “returns” to existing ones, and he did so undetected for decades. He promised steady returns, rather than big payouts. And that’s what he appeared to deliver through a recession in the early ’90s, the dot-com bust in the late ’90s, and after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. The global financial crisis in 2008, however, brought about his undoing. Institutional investors withdrew hundreds of millions from his fund and he didn’t have enough new investors to pay them out. He died at age 82 in 2021 from kidney disease in a prison hospital. He was denied early release when he was given 18 months to live. At that point, he had served 11 years of his sentence. Elizabeth Holmes Elizabeth Holmes may not have been sentenced for nearly as long as Madoff, but the downfall of her failed blood testing company Theranos is just as notorious. Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 after dropping out of Stanford University. She claimed that the company had developed technology that could perform a wide range of blood tests by collecting blood through just a finger prick. She signed on to a partnership with Walgreens to bring the technology to their stores. At one point, Theranos was valued at $9 billion, making Holmes, given her 50 percent stake in the company, one of only a few female billionaires in Silicon Valley. She was on the covers of Fortune, Forbes, and Inc. She drew in investors including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and Oracle executive chairman and founder Larry Ellison, as well as credentialed board members including former US Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. But the device, known as the Edison, never worked as described, as was uncovered by a Wall Street Journal investigation. In November 2022, she was convicted of four counts of defrauding investors and later sentenced to 11 years and three months in prison. However, her sentence has since been quietly reduced by about two years for good behavior. Allen Stanford Allen Stanford was sentenced to 110 years in prison in 2012 for orchestrating a $7 billion Ponzi scheme through his financial firm, Stanford Financial Group. Once a billionaire who managed $50 billion in customer funds, he sold fraudulent certificates of deposit — which allows consumers to deposit funds for a specific period of time and at an interest rate usually higher than normal savings accounts — from his offshore bank in Antigua to some 50,000 investors. Many of them were retirees seeking safe investments. He used the proceeds to subsidize a lavish lifestyle in Antigua, whose economy suffered in the wake of his prosecution given that he had become its largest employer. As of 2019, his victims had not been able to recover nearly as much of their funds as Madoff’s. Jeffrey Skilling Jeffrey Skilling was the CEO of Enron Corporation, once one of the largest energy companies worldwide, during its collapse in 2001 in what became one of the most infamous cases of corporate fraud in history. Enron’s downfall came about when it came to light that the company had covered up major debts and losses through complex accounting techniques and entities that were not reported on its balance sheets. This inflated Enron’s perceived financial health and therefore its stock price. Skilling had a hand in promoting these accounting practices and became a symbol of Enron’s corporate greed. The stock price dropped after the revelations, causing investors to incur billions in losses, and the company filed for bankruptcy in December 2001. Thousands of employees lost their jobs. It led to the passage of a landmark federal law in 2002 aimed at improving corporate governance and financial reporting standards. In 2006, Skilling was convicted of 19 criminal counts including fraud, conspiracy, and insider trading. Though several other executives were also prosecuted, he received one of the longest sentences: 24 years in prison. However, he only ended up serving 12 after demonstrating good behavior; after his release, he went to work for an energy startup , Veld Applied Analytics, which is developing tools to monitor oil and gas assets.

"2","Smoke rises over the forest during a wildfire in Viña del Mar, Chile, on February 3, 2024. Lucas Aguayo Araos/Anadolu via Getty Images Last month, a heat wave persisted for days in the Chilean coastal city of Viña del Mar. The landscape, already affected by an El Niño -supercharged drought , was baked dry. So, when wildfires sparked, they ripped through densely populated and mountainous terrain. In just a few days, the fires — the deadliest in Chile’s history — burned 71,000 acres and killed at least 134 people . Devastating wildfires like these are becoming increasingly common . Climate change is partly to blame — while research has found that both El Niño and climate change have contributed to intense wildfires in Chile in recent years, scientists disagree whether climate change had a statistically significant impact on these particular February fires. But the Chilean fires also underscore another ominous dynamic: Grasses, shrubs, and trees that humans have introduced to new ecosystems are increasing wildfire occurrence and frequency . In central Chile over five decades, timber companies have converted natural forests to homogenous, sprawling plantations of nonnative eucalyptus and Monterey pine that grow rapidly in the country’s Mediterranean climate. These trees contain an oily resin that makes them especially flammable but coupled with hotter and drier conditions due to climate change, they can be explosive, says Dave McWethy, an assistant professor at Montana State University. Our relationship with such nonnative species is fraught . We enable the spread of nonnatives by purposely transporting species to landscapes that haven’t previously existed with them. Take English ivy, a popular choice for stabilizing soil as an ornamental plant. Or the Norway maple, which was introduced to the East Coast of the US in 1756, quickly becoming popular for the shade it provided. In the process, such nonnatives can displace local ecologies and native species, disrupt agriculture , or transmit disease . Once a critter or a plant is introduced, either accidentally or purposefully, it can spread rapidly and outpace efforts to catch them at checkpoints or, as is the case for Florida’s state-sponsored “rodeos” for species like pythons , kill them. A report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) estimates that the approximately 3,500 geographically invasive plants and animals worldwide cost the global economy $423 billion annually. Climate change is also shuffling the ecological deck: As Vox has reported , ecologists expect climate change to create “range-shifting” or “climate-tracking” species that move to survive hotter temperatures. Perhaps some of those species will be more fire-prone. “Fires in places that are not used to fires are going to become much worse because of invasive species,” said Anibal Pauchard, co-author of the IPBES report and a professor at the University of Concepción and director of the Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity in Chile. Such trends are causing wildfires to burn in unexpected places in the US as well. Last summer, for example, a wildfire — fueled by guinea grass, molasses grass, and buffel grass — killed at least 101 people in Maui. Related How Maui’s wildfires became so apocalyptic According to research published in the journal PNAS , eight species of nonnative grasses are increasing fire occurrence by between 27 and 230 percent in the US. This means, due in part to the spread of nonnative species, millions of people in the US will be affected by more frequent wildfires and the unhealthy smoke they produce. As the research shows, invasive grasses are altering historic fire activity and behavior in a variety of locations across the US. This includes those living in the arid West (especially the Great Basin and the Southwest) but also those in more humid parts of the country, particularly people living near eastern temperate deciduous forests, which cover the eastern US, and pine savannah ecoregions from central South Carolina to central Florida. A firefighter helps battle a brush fire in the Meadowlands near Metlife Stadium in Carlstadt, New Jersey, in 2012. Fire departments struggled to bring under control one of many brush fires that broke out in New Jersey and New York that year. Such brush fires are increasing common in the Eastern US as the climate continues to change. Michael Bocchieri/Getty Images The nonnative grasses driving wildfire risk in the US While no one factor causes a big fire to happen on its own, nonnative grasses have played a more important role in recent decades — especially in low-elevation regions without much fire historically, said Seth Munson, an ecologist with the Southwest Biological Science Center in Flagstaff, Arizona. The annual invasive grass cheatgrass, known for its hairy tops, is found in an estimated 50-70 million acres nationwide, mostly in the Great Basin states. Lands with at least 15 percent cheatgrass are twice as likely to burn as those with a low abundance of the grass, and four times more likely to burn multiple times, according to researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of Idaho, and University of Colorado. According to the latest data, eight of the largest fires on record in the Great Basin have happened since 2010. That includes Nevada’s Martin Fire, which burned over 435,000 acres in 2018 and destroyed large swaths of grazing pastures for cattle and habitat of the federally protected sage grouse. Another invasive grass, cogongrass flourishes across Florida and the Gulf States, infiltrating traditional pine woodlands. These landscapes are already burning, with harsh human consequences. Wildfires in northwest Florida in recent years have scorched homes, prompted the evacuation of over a thousand people, and cost millions of dollars. The largest wildfire in Texas state history, only recently contained, damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes, killing at least two people and thousands of cows. Hundreds of wildfires in Louisiana last summer also resulted in two deaths. Buffelgrass is taking root all over Arizona’s Sonoran Desert, and red brome is spreading in the Mojave and other deserts. Highly flammable tamarisk shrubs have taken root in thick stands near streams in the western US, and eucalyptus — one of the primary invasive trees blamed for worsening Chile’s recent wildfires as well as fires in Portugal — increases wildfire risk in California. What can be done? Limiting the introduction of nonnative plants, when possible, addresses the problem at its root. But many invasive species already have a foothold somewhere nearby. In that case, early detection of invasive species, by satellite imagery or by people on the ground, is the best way to stop invasives with a variety of removal techniques, be that herbicide or something else, in an attempt to keep them somewhat contained. Federal agencies across the country, like the one Munson works for, as well as states, tribes, nonprofits, and others, are already monitoring for the movement of invasive species on the landscape and attempting to manage them as they inevitably spread. Work is also underway to help native plants reestablish faster after fires, giving them a chance against invasives angling for the same open space. You can do your part by finding out which nonnative plants exist in your area, especially those that increase wildfire risk. And if you’re looking to spruce up your home’s landscaping, don’t plant them; consider a native alternative instead. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Is Joe Biden in deep reelection trouble, or is there good reason to think he’s headed for a comeback? The question has divided the political world for months. The case that Biden’s on track for defeat is pretty simple: He’s trailed Trump in a large majority of the national and swing state polls conducted since last September . That means it’s been six months with very little good polling news for Biden. If you take the polls seriously, he’s in trouble — and those who fear Trump’s return to power should be very worried indeed. The case for a Biden comeback, on the other hand, goes something like this: It’s still too early for the polls to tell us much, but there are a lot of reasons we might logically expect Biden to do better. After all, the economy has improved . Trump is headed to trial. Biden has a fundraising advantage . Democrats have been doing rather well in special elections, and they exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterms. And eventually, the general election will bring focus from the media and campaigns on a binary choice between Trump and Biden — which means more focus on Trump’s extremism and scandals. That all sounds convincing enough. But the Biden skeptics fire back: Aren’t you just coming up with excuses to explain away the unpleasant reality the polls are clearly showing? Aren’t you just reasoning backward from your belief that Biden should be winning — and ignoring the best evidence, which states that things look pretty dire for him? The case that Biden is in deep trouble President Joe Biden departs the White House March 22, 2024 in Washington, DC. Win McNamee/Getty Images Start with Biden’s low approval: According to FiveThirtyEight’s poll average , Biden has been deeply unpopular since late 2021 — his average approval rating has been in the high 30s or low 40s since then. Since the State of the Union address, Biden’s number has slightly improved — from 38.1 percent on March 7 to 39.3 percent as of March 27, per FiveThirtyEight. But that’s still a very bad approval rating. At this point in Trump’s term, his approval was about 45 percent — more than 5 points better. And, of course, he lost. Trump has led most national polls: An approval rating can’t tell you everything in a two-way race because your opponent may be deeply unpopular too. But the head-to-head poll numbers haven’t been comforting for Biden lately either, since they’ve shown Trump ahead for the past six months. (Biden very recently rose to about a tie in the Economist’s polling average , while Trump still leads by just over 1 point in RealClearPolitics’s average .) vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page . Subscribe Trump leads most swing state polls: Of course, the presidency is decided by the Electoral College, not a national vote. And swing state polling for Biden has been very bad. In Georgia , Arizona , and Nevada , Trump has led in every poll tracked by FiveThirtyEight since November, often by sizable margins. If he loses the three states above, Biden would need Michigan , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin to win. Trump has led in most — but not all — polls in all three states in recent months. Other bad signs: Besides the polls, the skeptics believe there are other reasons to doubt whether Biden will be able to pull it off. Age: Voters have regularly said in polls that Biden’s age is a problem for them . Inflation: It has slowed recently, but voters still may resent hikes in prices and then interest rates that have occurred while Biden was president (even though much of the inflation was caused by factors out of Biden’s control, and he doesn’t directly control interest rates either). International comparisons: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are all extremely unpopular right now (even more so than Biden), suggesting it could just be a rough time to be an incumbent leader in a Western democracy. The case for Joe Biden being the Comeback Kid U.S. President Joe Biden departs the White House on March 19, 2024 in Washington, DC. Win McNamee/Getty Images Start with skepticism about early polls: With so much of the fear that Biden is doomed based on his bad polling, it’s worth noting that the election is still about seven months away. Polling from late March 2016 showed Hillary Clinton leading Trump by 11 points . Clearly things can change by quite a lot before election day. Instead of early polls, look at recent election results: In 2022, Democrats performed well in swing states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. The party held on to the Senate, and the House didn’t see the typical midterm blowout (the “red wave” many predicted) but instead a very close contest Republicans only narrowly won. Democrats have also done quite well in special elections over the past year. Now, don’t get too carried away with this. Democrats’ coalition is now heavily skewed toward college-educated high-engagement voters who are more likely to turn out in off-year elections. Skeptics argue that such an advantage will surely drop in a higher-turnout presidential year, when infrequent voters are more likely to show up. There’s another interesting wrinkle here. Because polls show Biden struggling badly among less-engaged voters , the topline results that he’s losing are effectively based on pollsters’ assumptions about how likely those less- engaged voters are to turn out. Are those assumptions solid? We won’t know until election day. Upcoming campaign and media dynamics may help Biden: Biden comeback believers contend that three main factors will likely help the president in the coming months. An improving economy: Voters have been negative about the economy for years, but their perceptions have improved somewhat in recent months. It’s true that that hasn’t seemed to helped Biden’s poll standing much yet, but perhaps it will take some time to sink in. Trump may become a felon: Trump’s indictments don’t seem to have hurt him up to this point, but polls have regularly shown many voters say they will reconsider supporting him if he’s actually convicted of a crime. His first criminal trial, in the New York hush money case, is set to begin April 15. More attention on Trump and Republicans’ extremism: As the election approaches, a well-funded Democratic campaign and outside group apparatus will spend heavily to remind voters about the threat Trump poses to American democracy and the threat the GOP poses to abortion rights — both issues that helped Democrats triumph in key 2022 races. The mainstream media will increasingly frame the choice before voters as “Trump vs. Biden” as well. Perhaps many of the disgruntled Democrats and tuned-out independents who currently say they won’t vote for Biden will eventually choose the lesser of two evils once Trump’s awfulness is hammered home to them. Can we already see the comeback in polls? Perhaps the strongest point made by the Biden skeptics is that the polls have been quite consistent for quite some time. Sure, they say, you can tell yourself that Biden will bounce back at some point — but those polls keep not budging, so when will it happen? Indeed, I wrote about Biden’s bad polls last April , last September, and last November , and evidence for any comeback in that time has been scant. But some now say we’re seeing our first signs in polls that the comeback is underway. As mentioned, Biden is currently tied with Trump in the Economist’s polling average — in recent months, he’s generally been down by 2 to 3 points. Polls released this week have shown some improvement for him in swing states and nationally , pointing toward a race that’s about tied, not one where Trump has a clear edge. Again, don’t get carried away. It’s too early to say whether this will prove to be a durable trend. But it’s worth keeping in mind that even when Trump has been polling best, the race hasn’t looked like a total blowout. Trump has had, on average, small single-digit leads both nationally and in key swing states. That’s the sort of lead that no candidate can really take for granted. The election was quite close in 2016 and 2020 — so close that any confident prediction about who would win was, in retrospect, overconfident. Given the repeat candidates, it’s reasonable to expect another close election this time around. This story appeared originally in Today, Explained , Vox’s flagship daily newsletter.

"2","Line up a few years’ worth of tragedies and disasters, and the online conversations about them will reveal their patterns. The same conspiracy- theory-peddling personalities who spammed X with posts claiming that Tuesday’s Baltimore bridge collapse was a deliberate attack have also called mass shootings “false flag” events and denied basic facts about the Covid-19 pandemic . A Florida Republican running for Congress blamed “DEI” for the bridge collapse as racist comments about immigration and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott circulated among the far right. These comments echo Trump in 2019, who called Baltimore a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess,” and, in 2015, blamed President Obama for the unrest in the city. As conspiracy theorists compete for attention in the wake of a tragedy, others seek engagement through dubious expertise , juicy speculation, or stolen video clips. The boundary between conspiracy theory and engagement bait is permeable ; unfounded and provoking posts often outpace the trickle of verified information that follows any sort of major breaking news event. Then, the conspiracy theories become content, and a lot of people marvel and express outrage that they exist. Then they kind of forget about the raging river of Bad Internet until the next national tragedy. I’ve seen it so many times. I became a breaking news reporter in 2012, which means that in internet years, I have the experience of an almost ancient entity. The collapse of the Francis Scott Key bridge into the Patapsco River, though, felt a little different from most of these moments for me, for two reasons. First, it was happening after a few big shifts in what the internet even is, as Twitter , once a go-to space for following breaking news events, became an Elon Musk-owned factory for verified accounts with bad ideas, while generative AI tools have superpowered grifters wanting to make plausible text and visual fabrications. And second, I live in Baltimore. People I know commute on that bridge, which forms part of the city’s Beltway. Some of the workers who fell, now presumed dead, lived in a neighborhood across the park from me. The local cost of global misinformation On Tuesday evening, I called Lisa Snowden , the editor-in-chief of the Baltimore Beat — the city’s Black-owned alt-weekly — and an influential presence in Baltimore’s still pretty active X community. I wanted to talk about how following breaking news online has changed over time. Snowden was up during the early morning hours when the bridge collapsed. Baltimore’s X presence is small enough that journalists like her generally know who the other journalists are working in the city, especially those reporting on Baltimore itself. Almost as soon as news broke about the bridge, though, she saw accounts she’d never heard of before speaking with authority about what had happened, sharing unsourced video, and speculating about the cause. Over the next several hours, the misinformation and racism about Baltimore snowballed on X. For Snowden, this felt a bit like an invasion into a community that had so far survived the slow death of what was once Twitter by simply staying out of the spotlight. “Baltimore Twitter, it’s usually not as bad,” Snowden said. She sticks to the people she follows. “But today I noticed that was pretty much impossible. It got extremely racist. And I was seeing other folks in Baltimore also being like, ‘This might be what sends me finally off this app.’” Here are some of the tweets that got attention in the hours after the collapse: Paul Szypula, a MAGA influencer with more than 100,000 followers on X, tweeted “Synergy Marine Group [the company that owned the ship in question] promotes DEI in their company. Did anti-white business practices cause this disaster?” alongside a screenshot of a page on the company’s website that discussed the existence of a diversity and inclusion policy. That tweet got more than 600,000 views. Another far-right influencer speculated that there was some connection between the collapse and, I guess, Barack Obama? I don’t know. The tweet got 5 million views as of mid-day Wednesday. Being online during a tragic event is full of consequential nonsense like this, ideas and conspiracy theories that are inane enough to fall into the fog of Poe’s Law and yet harmful to actual people and painful to see in particular when it’s your community being turned into views. Sure, there are best practices you can follow to try to contribute to a better information ecosystem in these moments. Those practices matter. But for Snowden, the main thing she can do as her newsroom gets to work reporting on the impact of this disaster on the community here is to let time march on. “In a couple days, this terrible racist mob, or whatever it is, is going to be onto something else,” Snowden said. “ Baltimore ... people are still going to need things. Everybody’s still going to be working. So I’m just kind of waiting it out,” she said “But it does hurt.” A version of this story was published in the Vox Technology newsletter.

"2","In January, the International Energy Agency (IEA) issued its forecast for global energy use over the next two years. Included for the first time were projections for electricity consumption associated with data centers, cryptocurrency , and artificial intelligence . The IEA estimates that, added together, this usage represented almost 2 percent of global energy demand in 2022 — and that demand for these uses could double by 2026, which would make it roughly equal to the amount of electricity used by the entire country of Japan. We live in the digital age, where many of the processes that guide our lives are hidden from us inside computer code. We are watched by machines behind the scenes that bill us when we cross toll bridges, guide us across the internet, and deliver us music we didn’t even know we wanted. All of this takes material to build and run — plastics, metals, wiring, water — and all of that comes with costs. Those costs require trade-offs. None of these trade- offs is as important as in energy. As the world heats up toward increasingly dangerous temperatures, we need to conserve as much energy as we can get to lower the amount of climate-heating gases we put into the air. That’s why the IEA’s numbers are so important, and why we need to demand more transparency and greener AI going forward. And it’s why right now we need to be conscientious consumers of new technologies, understanding that every bit of data we use, save, or generate has a real-world cost. One of the areas with the fastest-growing demand for energy is the form of machine learning called generative AI, which requires a lot of energy for training and a lot of energy for producing answers to queries. Training a large language model like OpenAI’s GPT-3, for example, uses nearly 1,300 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, the annual consumption of about 130 US homes . According to the IEA, a single Google search takes 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, while a ChatGPT request takes 2.9 watt-hours. (An incandescent light bulb draws an average of 60 watt-hours of juice.) If ChatGPT were integrated into the 9 billion searches done each day, the IEA says, the electricity demand would increase by 10 terawatt=hours a year — the amount consumed by about 1.5 million European Union residents. I recently spoke with Sasha Luccioni , lead climate researcher at an AI company called Hugging Face, which provides an open-source online platform for the machine learning community that supports the collaborative, ethical use of artificial intelligence. Luccioni has researched AI for more than a decade, and she understands how data storage and machine learning contribute to climate change and energy consumption — and are set to contribute even more in the future. I asked her what any of us can do to be better consumers of this ravenous technology. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Brian Calvert AI seems to be everywhere. I’ve been in meetings where people joke that our machine overlords might be listening. What exactly is artificial intelligence? Why is it getting so much attention? And why should we worry about it right now — not in some distant future? Sasha Luccioni Artificial intelligence has actually been around as a field since the ’50s, and it’s gone through various “AI winters” and “AI summers.” Every time some new technique or approach gets developed, people get very excited about it, and then, inevitably, it ends up disappointing people, triggering an AI winter. We’re going through a bit of an AI summer when it comes to generative AI. We should definitely stay critical and reflect upon whether or not we should be using AI, or generative AI specifically, in applications where it wasn’t used before. Brian Calvert What do we know about the energy costs of this hot AI summer? Sasha Luccioni It’s really hard to say. With an appliance, you plug it into your socket and you know what energy grid it’s using and roughly how much energy it’s using. But with AI, it’s distributed. When you’re doing a Google Maps query, or you’re talking to ChatGPT, you don’t really know where the process is running. And there’s really no transparency with regard to AI deployment. From my own research , what I’ve found is that switching from a nongenerative, good old-fashioned quote-unquote AI approach to a generative one can use 30 to 40 times more energy for the exact same task. So, it’s adding up, and we’re definitely seeing the big-picture repercussions. Brian Calvert So, in material terms, we’ve got a lot of data, we’re storing a lot of data, we’ve got language models, we’ve got models that need to learn, and that takes energy and chips. What kind of things need to be built to support all this, and what are the environmental real-world impacts that this adds to our society? Sasha Luccioni Static data storage [like thumb drives] doesn’t, relatively speaking, consume that much energy. But the thing is that nowadays, we’re storing more and more data. You can search your Google Drive at any moment. So, connected storage — storage that’s connected to the internet — does consume more energy, compared to nonconnected storage. Training AI models consumes energy. Essentially you’re taking whatever data you want to train your model on and running it through your model like thousands of times. It’s going to be something like a thousand chips running for a thousand hours. Every generation of GPUs — the specialized chips for training AI models — tends to consume more energy than the previous generation. They’re more powerful, but they’re also more energy intensive. And people are using more and more of them because they want to train bigger and bigger AI models. It’s kind of this vicious circle. When you deploy AI models, you have to have them always on. ChatGPT is never off. Brian Calvert Then, of course, there’s also a cooling process. We’ve all felt our phones heat up, or had to move off the couch with our laptops — which are never truly on our laps for long. Servers at data centers also heat up. Can you explain a little bit how they are cooled down? Sasha Luccioni With a GPU, or with any kind of data center, the more intensely it runs, the more heat it’s going to emit. And so in order to cool those data centers down, there’s different kinds of techniques. Sometimes it’s air cooling, but majoritarily, it’s essentially circulating water. And so as these data centers get more and more dense, they also need more cooling, and so that uses more and more water . Brian Calvert We have an AI summer, and we have some excitement and some hype. But we also have the possibility of things scaling up quite a bit. How might AI data centers be different from the data centers that we already live with? What challenges will that present from an ecological or environmental perspective going forward? Sasha Luccioni Data centers need a lot of energy to run, especially the hyperscale ones that AI tends to run on. And they need to have reliable sources of energy. So, often they’re built in places where you have nonrenewable energy sources , like natural gas-generated energy or coal- generated energy, where you flip a switch and the energy is there. It’s harder to do that with solar or wind, because there’s often weather factors and things like that. And so what we’ve seen is that the big data centers are built in places where the grid is relatively carbon intensive. Brian Calvert What kinds of practices and policies should we be considering to either slow AI down or green it up? Sasha Luccioni I think that we should be providing information so that people can make choices, at a minimum. Eventually being able to choose a model, for example, that is more energy efficient, if that’s something that people care about, or that was trained on noncopyrighted data. Something I’m working on now is kind of an Energy Star rating for AI models. Maybe some people don’t care, but other people will choose a more efficient model. Brian Calvert What should I think about before upgrading my data plan? Or why should I hold off on asking AI to solve my kid’s math homework? What should any of us consider before getting more gadgetry or getting more involved with a learned machine? Sasha Luccioni In France, they have this term, “ digital sobriety .” Digital sobriety could be part of the actions that people can take as 21st-century consumers and users of this technology. I’m definitely not against having a smartphone or using AI, but asking yourself, “Do I need this new gadget?” “Do I really need to use ChatGPT for generating recipes?” “Do I need to be able to talk to my fridge or can I just, you know, open the door and look inside?” Things like that, right? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it with generative AI. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","The Islamic State — the notorious group known for building a brutal regime in Iraq and Syria — has claimed responsibility for Friday’s terror attack at a Moscow concert venue that killed at least 139 people. ISIS released graphic footage via its media apparatus , claiming that it was their gunmen who left more than 100 people injured at the Crocus City concert hall. And it likely is the case, despite Russia’s attempts to tie the incident to Ukraine. US intelligence officials linked the terror group’s outpost in the historical Khorasan region — which encompasses parts of Afghanistan , Iran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan — to the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that Islamic radicals perpetrated the attack, but the Kremlin has still tried to link Ukraine to the incident . “We know by whose hand the crime against Russia and its people was committed. But what is of interest to us is who ordered it,” Putin said in a video address Monday . ISIS has always been somewhat rhizomatic, with offshoots connected to the main entity in Iraq and Syria. For years, ISIS welcomed the emergence of affiliate groups that might have more local or regional goals, like ISIS-K and ISIS-West Africa, as long as they pledged allegiance to the caliphate ISIS had declared. But after ISIS suffered a major territorial defeat in Iraq and Syria five years ago, ISIS-K has since solidified its distinct political grievances, which center around its battle for power with the Taliban in Afghanistan. And because of its location in a fairly lawless region, the group can recruit and train without significant interference. For ISIS-K and the larger group, attacking Russia is a logical outgrowth of ISIS’s territorial defeat, since Russia supports the Assad regime in Syria and helped it regain control of the land ISIS briefly held. ISIS-K also has grievances with Russia because of its 1979-1989 war in Afghanistan, as well as Russia’s slaughter of Chechen Muslims in its war there. While it seems like ISIS-K holds some degree of responsibility, just how much the organization was involved in Friday’s attack is a lot less clear, according to Riccardo Valle, the director of research at the Khorasan Diary , which provides analysis on non-state and militant actors in the region. “There are several hints, some stronger, some weaker, that could suggest the involvement of the Islamic State of Khorasan branch in the implementation of the attack,” Valle told Vox, “from providing financial support or logistic support, operational support, or could be also more limited involvement,” like using its Russian- and Tajik-language propaganda to encourage local ISIS cells in Russia to attack. There’s a lot of noise around ISIS-K, and whether the Moscow attack means ISIS is “back” — meaning it has the ability to carry out attacks in Western countries and hold territory the way it did a decade ago. While it’s difficult to say what ISIS-K or the core group might do next, recent events show that the threat of extremism isn’t gone. What we know about ISIS and its affiliates now ISIS is an extremist group that follows a fundamentalist version of Sunni Islam and grew out of Al Qaeda’s Iraqi affiliate following the US invasion there in 2003. It gained prominence, though, in 2014 when it captured large swaths of Iraq and Syria. That was central to the group’s primary goal: to establish a global caliphate — traditionally understood as an Islamic political and religious state like the one that existed following the death of the prophet Muhammad, but which ISIS interpreted in a much more violent and repressive manner, especially when it came to women and religious minorities. The nature of ISIS has always been somewhat diffuse; it has historically claimed attacks or groups , like a splinter faction of Boko Haram in northwestern Africa , often referred to as ISWAP, that pledges its allegiance to the broader organization, even encouraging lone wolf actors to increase its reach. “It’s much more about ‘taking the fight to our enemies,’ rather than focused on particularly the nuances of Islamic theology,” Daniel Byman , senior fellow with the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox. And that broad ideology incorporates political motivations as well as religious ones. So although according to ISIS the US, Israel , Europe, Iran, and Russia are all “idolators,” or enemies based on religious affiliation, they’re also political adversaries. In other words, ISIS is predominantly interested in creating that global caliphate over which it maintains territorial, ideological, and political control. Enter: ISIS-K. The group was founded in 2014 or 2015 (around the same time as the core ISIS group rose to prominence) as something of an offshoot of the original group . It was also founded in opposition to the Taliban and made the case for a global caliphate, not a national emirate like the Taliban wanted — particularly, the control of the entire Khorasan region. The historical Khorasan region is important to Islam, and particularly Islamic jihadist and messianic tradition because of a teaching attributed to the Prophet Muhammad , which claims that Muslims will fight non-believers in the region at the end of the world. ISIS-K has been fighting the Taliban since 2015 — a tension that really ramped up following the fall of Afghanistan’s elected government in August 2021 after the US withdrew. It has repeatedly attacked ethnic Hazara in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime — both as a repudiation of the minority group’s Shia ideology, but also to prove the Taliban’s poor handle on security in the country and its lack of willingness to protect minorities. The Taliban is also, according to ISIS-K, “just the natural successors to the Afghan Islamic Republic, and hence they are basically [allies] of all regional countries and of the United States [who are] all united to fight the Islamic State in Afghanistan and globally,” Valle said. But, again, given the group’s global focus, their conflict doesn’t stop with the Taliban. Russia became another natural target, for example. That’s in part because the core ISIS group sees the country as responsible for its destruction, due to Russia and Iran’s role in propping up the Assad regime in Syria, especially as it regained control of ISIS’s former caliphate. (It doesn’t help that both the Assad regime and Iranian government are Shia.) How to understand the ISIS threat now What is clear, according to the experts Vox spoke to, is that ISIS is still well coordinated and capable of causing harm across the region. Take the latest attack in Russia, which was pulled off in Moscow amid a war: “All that points to some significant training,” said Colin Clarke , an analyst at the Soufan Center. “This wasn’t an example of an incident where some [random] radicalized Central Asians living in Russia were sitting around on their phones, imbibing ISIS propaganda, and they decided to launch an attack of their own.” We don’t know exactly what the directives for last Friday’s attack might have looked like or how much the core group is instructing affiliates — so we might never know the breakdown of how exactly it happened. Russia has released photos of the alleged attackers , but the exact order of operations and planning is unlikely to come out any time soon, both because of the nature of Russian propaganda and the groups themselves. More broadly: It’s difficult to tell how connected ISIS-K and other affiliates are to the core ISIS group, and to what extent the affiliates take direction from the core and coordinate with each other to carry out attacks. “These groups are basically fluid, they are not armies, they are not states,” Valle said. “So they move in a fluid manner. So we cannot [distinguish] from one to the other so sharply; sometimes people work with different entities and networks.” But in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan where ISIS-K trains and operates, there’s very little ability for the Taliban — let alone the international community — to monitor or threaten the group. “Afghanistan has been a free-for-all” since the US withdrawal in 2021, Clarke said. “The US probably still has decent signals intelligence … but probably almost no human intelligence. And that’s gonna lead to some blind spots naturally. And so I think we don’t know a lot about what’s been going on in Afghanistan, clearly.” Though Western intelligence services adapted to the ISIS threat in the mid-2010s, Clarke noted that the world’s attention had turned away from those kinds of terror threats. “Now, it’s all about great power competition, China , artificial intelligence , all these other things,” he said. “There’s a certain sense of terrorism fatigue, after 20 years of the global war on terrorism, people don’t want to think about it. They don’t want to talk about it. They don’t want to prepare for it.” But ISIS, and ISIS-K in particular, haven’t stopped training and planning just because the Western world stopped paying attention. The group’s bold and well-coordinated attack in Moscow, as well as the ISIS-K attack in Iran in January , indicate that at least some affiliates possess the capabilities, funding, and motivation to inflict significant casualties and serious damage on their perceived enemies. And though the threat is diminished compared to the height of ISIS’s power in the mid-2010s, the overall terror threat is “in absolute terms, I would say it’s pretty high,” Valle said. Specifically, there is “risk that something similar or to a lesser extent — still dangerous — can happen also in Europe, and this is because in the last months of 2023 and the first months of 2024, several cells and local networks of militants were dismantled in Europe, in Austria, Germany, Netherlands, and the UK.” Indeed, both Italian and French authorities ramped up security following the attacks in Moscow . Both countries have major cultural events upcoming — Holy Week celebrations in Italy and the Summer Olympics in Paris. ISIS-K has a pattern of attacking large cultural events, including mosques during prayers in Afghanistan and a memorial service for assassinated Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in Iran earlier this year. But it’s important to note that European counterterror services are much more capable of detecting these kinds of threats than they were a decade ago. And US intelligence knew about the Iran and Moscow attacks before they happened, warning both countries of the threats . None of that is to say that a terror attack on a Western country is impossible, but the US and Europe are better equipped for one than a decade ago. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Last November, after just a few hours of deliberation, a New York jury convicted Sam Bankman-Fried of fraud and conspiracy in the public flameout of his cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which stands accused of stealing as much as $10 billion from customers. On March 28, Bankman-Fried, who gained international prominence as the disheveled crypto genius behind the exchange, which he founded in 2019, was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. The intense, five-week criminal trial last fall unveiled the framework of deception that Bankman-Fried, 32, had for years used to prop up FTX and himself and, despite the protests of some crypto enthusiasts that he was just one rotten apple , made it hard for the public not to wonder whether the rest of the crypto world operates with such disregard for rules and risk behind the scenes, too. Take, for example, Bankman-Fried’s jarring testimony — a final attempt to drive home his narrative of wide-eyed carelessness — that he “ didn’t know anything about crypto ” before starting FTX, his now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. “I just knew they were things you could trade,” he told the jury. Millions of customers had traded on FTX, depositing money onto the exchange on the basis that it was the most trustworthy crypto exchange available. After the company filed for bankruptcy late last year , approximately 9 million creditors, including FTX customers and investors, were identified. At its height, FTX was valued at more than $32 billion, and Bankman-Fried himself was worth about $26 billion . That lucrative empire fell to shambles in late 2022, when it became public that FTX had been using the deposits of its customers as a de facto piggy bank covering both business and personal matters. Prosecutors said FTX took billions from its clients to cover debt and make trades at sister hedge fund Alameda Research, to buy luxury real estate, to make political and charitable donations, and more. Bankman-Fried was charged with multiple federal counts of fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy, and arrested in the Bahamas last December. The trial was much watched by crypto insiders, skeptics, and legal experts because it’s the biggest crypto fraud case to date, with wider consequences for the entire industry. The media, once full of effusive praise for Bankman-Fried and a key vehicle for his rise to fame, turned against him . The mood in the overflow rooms at the courthouse, filled with lawyers, crypto enthusiasts, financial victims of FTX’s fallout , and other rubberneckers, had reportedly been gleeful, with onlookers finding amusement in the trial’s twists and turns. The crypto industry had excommunicated its most visible titan, too, either because traders were angry they’d personally been burned or because they saw him as crypto’s worst ambassador, contributing to the impression that crypto is shady and replete with criminal activity. The prosecution came with a mountain of receipts. Former executives and employees at both FTX and Alameda, including Alameda CEO and Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison, FTX co-founder Gary Wang, and FTX head of engineering Nishad Singh, testified that they had committed crimes at his behest . Prosecutors also produced tweets, screenshots of texts and group chats, direct messages, and quotes from the many, many media appearances and interviews Bankman-Fried had given to the press. All the while, Bankman-Fried maintained his innocence, saying he didn’t realize FTX funds were missing until just before its collapse. The defense’s main weapon was to maintain that Bankman-Fried had merely been overworked and unwittingly allowed things at FTX and Alameda to spiral out of control — that it wasn’t intentional. He downplayed how much he knew, and how much control he had over his subordinates. “I don’t recall giving any direction,” he said when asked about the misuse of FTX customer funds. Throughout the trial, however, he and his defense failed to offer a compelling explanation for how billions had been misappropriated without the CEO’s knowledge, or why his subordinates would engage in such a scheme without his involvement. Adding to the circus-like atmosphere, his team requested a delay until the defendant could receive Adderall , a prescription drug often used to treat ADHD. The delay request was denied, but Bankman-Fried had also reported not having access to Adderall while in jail awaiting trial, and complained of cruel conditions . And then, with the defense’s arguments going poorly, they made an eleventh-hour decision to put Bankman-Fried on the stand. For years, Bankman-Fried presented himself as the oddball genius leader of an effort to legitimize the crypto world — to demystify it, and show the world that it was exciting but safe because he was a responsible steward. Early articles about him spotlit his incredible success — emphasizing his youth — and burgeoning influence , particularly as a philanthropist and political donor . He graced magazine covers and was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2022 . (Disclosure: In August 2022, Bankman-Fried’s philanthropic family foundation, Building a Stronger Future, awarded Vox’s Future Perfect a grant for a 2023 reporting project. That project was canceled.) He continued to try to control the narrative even in the months following the company’s implosion. “Basically, as soon as the company collapsed, he seemed to think that if he just explained things well enough, people would understand that he didn’t do anything wrong,” says Molly White, a crypto researcher who has been following the trial — and FTX at large — closely. Prosecutors even implied that the master storyteller spun a “smooth” narrative while on the stand, one that emphasized his earnestness and good intentions. During the trial, the prosecution also revealed a document created by Ellison titled “Things Sam Is Freaking Out About” — and on the list was “ bad press .” He had reason to worry. It took just one outlet to unravel the yarn Bankman-Fried had spun. The crypto news site CoinDesk’s initial questioning of Alameda’s balance sheet , for which it won the 2023 Loeb journalism award , was the flint that sparked the fire leading to his downfall. It’s telling that when the fire started blazing in earnest, with customers unable to withdraw their funds because the exchange didn’t have enough money on hand, one of Bankman-Fried’s top priorities was to tweet that everything was fine . When times were good, Bankman-Fried was happy to be the face of FTX and crypto. He founded both FTX and Alameda and remained FTX’s CEO until the bitter end. All this made the defense’s claim that Bankman-Fried didn’t know about the missing FTX money until October 2022, not long before the exchange’s collapse, harder to believe. If he wasn’t the ringleader, then who at FTX and Alameda had gotten the idea to take the money and use it on investments, swanky real estate, political donations, and so much more? Bankman-Fried couldn’t give a clear answer, instead implying that witnesses like Ellison, Singh, and Wang — who have all taken plea deals on their own fraud charges — were misremembering or lying. The defense told jurors that he didn’t know about FTX’s troubles in part because he and other FTX heads were so busy “building the plane as they were flying it.” Yet, in one of the most shocking moments of the trial, Ellison said that, on Bankman- Fried’s orders, she created not one but seven versions of falsified Alameda balance sheets that would make its financial situation seem less dire. These fake financial statements, prosecutors said, hid the billions Alameda owed FTX customers. One witness who helped fix a bug in FTX’s code testified that he’d told Bankman-Fried in summer 2022, months before whispers of trouble, that there were billions missing in customer funds at FTX. Singh, the former engineering director at FTX, testified that when he began to suspect Alameda was using FTX customers’ funds, he arranged a meeting with his boss to express his concerns. As FTX began to crumble in late 2022, Singh asked Bankman-Fried to take the bulk of the responsibility, as CEO of FTX . At the time, he testified, he thought Bankman-Fried had agreed. But the trial has made clear that Bankman-Fried is unwilling to take responsibility — in his telling, his only failure was that the founder and leader of one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world simply hadn’t caught on to the illegal machinations unfolding right under his nose. Part of the lie Bankman-Fried successfully sold was that FTX was one of the safest crypto exchanges. The implosion of FTX showed that it was not safe — and perhaps nothing about crypto was, either. But the appearance of being by-the-book and risk-calculated was essential to FTX’s pitch to investors and to customers, and partly why it was the third- largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume. It made Bankman-Fried a crypto whale — a term used to describe the handful of the biggest crypto holders in the world, often billionaires and multimillionaires — who had acted as the industry’s spokesperson. He publicly welcomed regulation (though he was adamant that crypto fall under the authority of the weaker Commodity Futures Trading Commission, not the Securities and Exchange Commission), and was often meeting with politicians in Washington, DC. He tried to put a palatable sheen on crypto, long treated with distrust and incomprehension by outsiders. All of these public facts were used against Bankman-Fried in court. The prosecution grilled him on making claims about FTX’s safety , and referred to a Vox interview where he revealed a hostile attitude toward government oversight of crypto, writing, “fuck regulators.” Reactions to the trial have shown that, like the jury, the crypto community is not on Bankman-Fried’s side, either. For some, his disgrace is a huge setback in the effort to clean up crypto’s reputation. “I think they’re very angry,” says White. For others, the idea of any regulation remains anathema to the ethos of crypto as a decentralized alternative to fiat currencies. In their view, Bankman-Fried was a sellout, or he was never really an adherent of crypto’s anti-establishment ideology in the first place. In private messages revealed in court, Bankman-Fried had called anti-regulation crypto advocates on Twitter “dumb motherfuckers” who were “about to hand the industry” to SEC chair Gary Gensler. It turns out Bankman- Fried and the FTX debacle have made regulatory scrutiny and crackdowns from Gensler’s SEC more likely. It has already been chasing after other major crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase , and the agency has signaled its intention to dramatically accelerate its enforcement actions . “I think some people are blaming this crackdown on the crypto industry on Sam Bankman- Fried personally,” says White. It’s not just about FTX and SBF, though. Throughout the trial, White says, we’ve seen ample indication that the chaos that went on at FTX may be “pretty normal stuff for the crypto world — things are often being run by the seat of someone’s pants.” In closing arguments, the defense argued that Bankman-Fried had made mistakes, but he was being unfairly smeared as a “ villain .” Everything he had done — the exorbitant spending on PR, the political donations, the falsehoods and exaggerations he told the public — had been in good faith and for the good of the business. The prosecution emphasized that this trial wasn’t really about crypto, but about “lies and stealing and greed.” It was about a man who spun a wild, alluring, but ultimately false tale. “Would you agree you know how to tell a good story?” US Attorney Danielle Sassoon asked as she cross-examined the defendant. “I don’t know. It depends on what metrics you use,” Bankman-Fried replied . In the end, the case, and the trial, served to shatter the myth of the monkish, eccentric crypto billionaire — an image that empowered Bankman- Fried to wield influence over crypto regulation and even on US politics. The outcome of the biggest crypto fraud trial ever all but ensures that the industry will be the target of more scrutiny, attempts at regulation, and cynicism. Bankman-Fried tried to weave a compelling case for why everyone but him was responsible for stealing people’s money. The jury determined that, in fact, the blame lies squarely on him. Update, March 28, 12:30 pm ET: This story was originally published on November 3, 2023, and has been updated to include Bankman-Fried’s federal prison sentence. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Two of the biggest stories in the American media at this moment are about staffing choices: former Republican National Committee chair Ronna Romney McDaniel’s hiring and swift firing from NBC, and popular commentator Candace Owens’s departure from the conservative Daily Wire (best known as the home for Ben Shapiro’s mega-popular podcast). While different in details, both stories are essentially about the same question: How can media organizations responsibly handle an increasingly radical conservative movement? In McDaniel’s case, the issue was election denial. After her hiring was announced, NBC staff revolted — noting her vocal defense of Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election while running the RNC. Some top talent, like Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, revolted on air — leading NBC to part ways with McDaniel before she really got started. At the Daily Wire, mainstreaming election denial is hardly a firing offense . But over the past months, Owens has outed herself as an antisemite — recently liking a social media post claiming that a prominent rabbi was “ drunk on Christian blood .” Eventually this became too much for the Shapiro-founded website; last week, CEO Jeremy Boreing announced that Owens and the site have “ ended their relationship .” In both cases, the media organization has received significant blowback. Republican sources are threatening to cut off NBC journalists in retaliation for McDaniel’s defenestration. Right-wing trolls, led by Hitler-admiring self- described incel Nick Fuentes , have led a campaign of antisemitic social media incitement against the Daily Wire in support of Owens. Objectively, this is all absurd: No news organization should have to face consequences for taking a stand against anti-democratic lies or antisemitic bigotry. But it’s important to understand why it’s happening: The conservative movement, the backbone of one of our two major political parties, is off the rails. That brute reality has thrown American media out of whack. Mainstream outlets are forced to choose between traditional notions of objectivity and platforming obscenity; right-wing outlets have lost whatever ability they once had to keep their followers onside. Journalism faces a right that has lost its bearings Imagine you’re the editor of an op-ed section at a major newspaper. You’ve got two main objectives: to both represent a broad spectrum of views and publish high- quality writing that makes your readers better informed. Clearly, you need to have conservative writers. But what kind? The ones who best represent where the Republican Party is at, hardline Trumpists, tend to be prone to lying and bigotry; they have to be in order to defend Trump and his core positions. Obviously, you don’t want to publish outright lies and apologias for racism. The best and smartest conservative writers, by contrast, reject election denial and oppose Trump’s racial demagoguery. But doing so puts them at odds with where the actual existing Republican Party is. By publishing them as spokespeople for conservatism, you risk misleading your readers about the true nature of the American right. This is a difficult dilemma, and hardly a hypothetical one. Every day in American media, editors and journalists have to make similar choices. Questions like “How do I accurately report what Republican sources say without publishing lies?” and “How can I describe a racist Trump comment without coming off as a Democratic hack?” are the everyday stuff of mainstream American media. For institutions that pride themselves on objectivity and fairness to all sides, these practical questions raise more philosophical ones. What does “objectivity” mean if not simply treating the positions of the two major parties as reasonable disputes between reasonable people? What is “fairness” in a world where a major party leader is opposed to basic principles of democratic fairness? How do we cover a party that has entirely lost its way? Conservative outlets face a somewhat different kind of calibration problem. Because their audience is made up of a radicalizing base, their own instincts about where to draw the line might be to the left of their customers’ — even at a place as solidly right-wing as the Daily Wire. Candace Owens was, by all accounts, a very popular podcast host. Losing her is no small thing. Reflecting on the Owens mishegoss, leading conservative activist Chris Rufo concluded that “ we have a problem on the right .” Per Rufo, “the economics of online discourse are increasingly at odds with forming and mobilizing a successful political movement.” This is an oblique acknowledgement that Owens’s schtick is popular among conservatives. Much like Trump, she has succeeded by openly telling people things they quietly believe but few others are willing to say (because they’re horrible). Being offensive isn’t incidental to her rise; it’s at the heart of it. This is not a new feature of conservative media: it’s part of what fueled Rush Limbaugh’s rise to prominence in 1990s talk radio. But elite conservatives like the Daily Wire’s editorial leadership long thought they could keep a lid on it , to draw lines and make the audiences play within them. Trump, Owens, and their ilk have proved that to be impossible. Both mainstream and right- wing media are thus grappling with the same dilemma: the conservative movement is a self-radicalizing perpetual motion machine. The more extreme it gets, the more awkward their own choices become. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","Politics is tough on principled people, just as it was on former U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, who passed away Wednesday at 82 years old. The rough and tumble of Athenian democracy bred the idea that whatever you can persuade people to be true and good is true and good. All one needed to do was to learn how to influence people. This bred a school of professional teachers, the Sophists, who trained men in the art of rhetoric so that they could win arguments and the minds of people through that power. Socrates argued against them, famously, and, equally famously, came to a bad end — bad enough in the eyes of his student Plato that he sought to escape from the reach of Athens so he could be free to follow Socrates in exploring what the good is in itself. Plato remained wary and skeptical of democracy. The Framers of our Constitution were well-read in the classics. They sought to avoid the mistakes of Athens and to achieve governance by consent of the governed without sacrificing principle and to so avoid the ruin that befell Athens. As the first president under the Constitution, George Washington had such widespread esteem and such a deep sense of public duty that one might have thought our own republic would proceed through history devoted to principle above party and rhetoric. When, on principle, Washington relinquished power after two terms, John Adams thought that he could continue to govern as if party mattered little. That dedication to principle guaranteed he would have no second term. His brilliant and principled diplomacy that settled the XYZ Affair without a war with France pleased neither the Jeffersonians (who thought Adams far too pro-British) nor the High Federalists (who wanted to join the Brits in their war with France). Whipsawed by partisans on either side, his brilliance and principle counted less with the voters than party and partisan rhetoric. Principle asserted itself again in American politics in the battle over slavery. The Whigs fell apart for sidestepping the issue, and the Republicans came into rapid prominence as the party dedicated to ending the spread of slavery. Abraham Lincoln forged a coalition of principle, first for the preservation of the Union but then on the underlying principle of ending the evil slavery. By 1684, he was running as a Unionist, successfully forging a coalition of all who would support the broad principle of a united country in which slavery was abolished. In the face of the Nazi threat, Winston Churchill called himself a unionist, reaching beyond his Conservative Party to forge a coalition of those who would stand up for their country regardless of party. When Neville Chamberlain’s Conservative government fell in the wake of disastrous defeat in Norway, Churchill alone had the ability to command respect and allegiance from all three parties and headed a memorable national government that broke the Luftwaffe, kept control of the seas, and eventually built the grand alliance that won victory on all fronts. Democracy’s reward for Churchill was that immediately upon the victory over Germany, he was turned out of office in a landslide, as his former coalition partners deserted him, and his own Conservative party was blamed for the appeasement policies that brought the war upon them. Joe Lieberman’s renown is for being a man of principle in an unprincipled profession. He was respected for it and derided for it. Regardless, with the fewest of exceptions, his record remained untarnished. A domestic liberal and a foreign affairs conservative, he would vote by his conscience enough to anger both his own party and others who courted his partisanship unsuccessfully. He drew the Clintons’ ire for his public censure of Bill’s unpresidential behavior. He was successfully primaried by his home-state Democrat Party because of his support of the War on Terror, but he had the last laugh, running and winning his reelection bid as an independent. His principles came from the deep well from which America has found its inspiration. He was a forthrightly religious man, willing to guide his use of the power entrusted him by the wisdom of God he found in his steady commitment to his faith. He had an apartment close enough to the Capitol so that if duty called on the Sabbath day, he could make the walk and observe his faith and his civic duties together. He spoke of faith openly and was not afraid to show his religious commitment, always. In a way, true to Jewish teachings, that afforded a respect for other Americans’ own faith commitments, which he rightly believed are the primary source of America’s strength. He was not successful, at least so far, in offering an alternative to our partisan deadlock with the Third Way movement, in which he was partnering with similarly independent centrists like Joe Manchin. And his brave Wall Street Journal op-ed , appearing only a few days before his passing — in which he took on Chuck Schumer’s shocking partisan betrayal of Israel — seemed not yet to have borne any fruit. But Joe Lieberman was, first of all, a man of faith, and he had faith that the principles for which one sacrifices live on beyond our demise. They elevate a person beyond the partiality that is our human lot, and our willingness to endure sacrifice for principle attaches us to the great truth that can never be controlled our perverted by our shortcomings. Churchill spoke of this in undying words: The only guide to a man is his conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions. It is very imprudent to walk through life without this shield, because we are so often mocked by the failure of our hopes and the upsetting of our calculations; but with this shield, however the fates may play, we march always in the ranks of honour. Churchill’s words eulogizing principle and conscience could have been written about Joe Lieberman. Certainly, they are appropriate to extol the man and his commitment and to inspire us to have the courage to let the politicking serve principles rather than the opposite, which seems to be the rule today. Be guided by this commitment to principle, and we all have common cause."
"1","I always wanted to cast a Kennedy vote. Whatever you think about John F. Kennedy, if you belong to a certain cohort, it left a hole in your heart when he was gunned down by a sociopath, possibly a KGB sleeper, on that awful day in Dallas in 1963. And you know in your heart that the country never recovered, even if you know in your head that the Great Republic’s ups and downs are not all due to that trauma and might have happened anyway, for their roots and causes preceded Camelot. Moreover, in its short time, Camelot addressed the challenges of the times less with sensible policy orientations and legislation than with symbolic gestures and soaring rhetoric. Yet ye knew you’d never resist a ticket with two such names as these, Kennedy–Shanahan. Now then, lads, cheer our gallant hero, all together, Mo Ghile Mear. Maybe this is all sentimental bosh, and, in fact, you did resist the temptation. Edward Kennedy was surely as much a son of the titan Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr. as were his fallen brothers and a fair grandson to the storied Honey Fitz, but to vote for him against the dour Jimmy Carter in ’80, let alone against the upbeat Ronald Reagan — no way. Lion of the Senate was flattery more than earned respect, if the aim of lion-hood was to lead the Senate into such catastrophic “reforms” as the immigration act of 1965 (“This bill will not flood our cities,” spake he) and the queering of presidential appointments by means of the mendacious tactic of “borking,” which not only deprived the Supreme Court of Judge Robert Bork but also contributed to a form of partisanship that Sen. Joe Biden enabled as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and from which we suffer still. But Bobby, now, there’s a lad fit to be a hero, and Kennedy–Shanahan, so lovely a lilt the ticket sounds, and such a lovely lass be she! Can you even compare Biden–Harris to that? You cannot. I once thought a logical move for the Dems would be something along the lines of Shapiro–Demings, a balanced ticket if ever there were one, but they did not listen to me, and anyway they are too anti-Jewish and anti-Black, so it’s a non-starter. And for extra value, consider that a green ticket on the ballot will force the right-wingers to balance theirs, and we could get an orange- green one, were the presumptive nominee to show enough class to make it up with Gen. John F. Kelly and invite him to join him “once more into the breach, dear friends, once more.” Admittedly, Kelly has reason to hesitate, so the apology would have to be very sincere and public, but would this not enhance the presumptive second termer in the eyes of those doubting his ability to show contrition? If they are worried about the woman vote, why, they can urge the candidate to pick a staunch Taft Republican and eminent jurist, Mrs. Maureen O’Connor. They could borrow some well-known lyrics and improvise a playful ditty in the self-deprecating style of JFK. Let it not be said politics cannot regain its energy and humor. Or that there are no second acts in American life. And still I dream of Jack Kennedy, and, like all true friends of R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., I have regularly lifted my glass at the local bar and joined him in those cruel sad yet brave hopeful verses of our youth: “Don’t let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot.”"
"2","In the lead-up to Friday’s release of Cowboy Carter , Beyoncé gave us a small tidbit about its inspiration. She wrote on Instagram that the album was “over five years in the making” and “born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed…and it was very clear that I wasn’t.” Without naming said experience outright, she added, “I did a deeper dive into the history of country music and studied our rich musical archive.” Following the breadcrumbs Bey dropped — an event from more than five years ago, country music, not feeling accepted — led many to the 2016 Country Music Association Awards . There, Beyoncé joined the Chicks for a surprise performance of “Daddy Lessons.” To date, it was one of the most significant performances in CMA history, yet it can’t be found on the CMA’s official channels. That may be the result of a wave of racist and sexist backlash targeting the CMAs for allowing Beyoncé to take their stage. At the time, the CMAs said the lack of video was at Beyoncé’s discretion. Why the backlash? It seemed a vocal contingent of fans believed Beyoncé — a Black woman unafraid to share her politics — isn’t what country music is. With Beyoncé poised to reenter the genre with Cowboy Carter this week, it raises some existential questions. What is country music? What should it represent? Who does it belong to? Who gets to make the rules? And perhaps the most pertinent question of all: Is Beyoncé going to change all of that? Why the CMAs could have inspired Cowboy Carter The key message in Beyoncé’s Instagram post is that she didn’t feel welcome and it was clear she wasn’t. Given her status, fame, and talent, the many A-list events that welcome her — the Oscars , the Grammys , the MTV Music Video Awards — absolutely overshadow any that wouldn’t. It could easily be argued that Beyoncé is bigger than the CMA Awards themselves. But there’s something deeper here. The CMAs both present and crystallize the identity of country music, as Alice Randall, a Black country songwriter and professor at Vanderbilt University explains to Vox. New stars are born, legends are honored, and legacies are cemented. In front of the genre’s elite, the CMAs determine what is — and, conversely, what isn’t — country music by whom they honor and what performances they spotlight. The backlash Beyoncé has faced is actually part of a larger story about the omission and erasure of Black artists within country music. An alternate cover of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter . Beyoncé/Blair Cardwell via Instagram “I was at the 20th anniversary of the Country Music Association, and it was an absolute turning point for me, because they talked about country music always being a family,” says Randall. “XXX’s and OOO’s,” which Randall cowrote, went to No. 1 on the country charts when Trisha Yearwood released her recording of the song in 1994. “But they only spoke of white people, even though many of the people on the stage that night had their career started by DeFord Bailey, the Opry’s first star. He was completely erased from the story. So this gatekeeping has been going on in different ways, and to the present moment, and often crystallizes around CMA performances,” she added. [Related: Beyoncé, the CMAs, and the fight over country music’s politics, explained ] The CMA Awards have the power to define mainstream culture’s perception of country music, of that family. Omitting Bailey sets a tone about what this genre looks like and who gets to be a part of it. Erasing his contributions makes country music’s history seem whiter and more homogenous than it is. What about the contributions of Black artists like Lillian Hardin Armstrong , Charley Pride , and Linda Martell ? Whitewashing the genre and implicitly making it unwelcome and difficult for Black artists to break through is what Randall refers to as the “cultural redlining” of country music, comparing it to the exclusionary tactic by which Black people were denied housing and mortgages through the 20th century. Randall frames Beyoncé’s 2016 performance as a powerful challenge to the status quo of the time, saying that’s why it struck such a nerve: a Black woman on stage with the Chicks (then the Dixie Chicks), who themselves had been iced out of the genre. “Here was a change they could not control. She was connecting to this audience in such unexpected and powerful ways. I think some people had resistance because it was a power they could not control, had not predicted, and perhaps are not poised to benefit by,” Randall said. Interestingly, since 2016, the CMAs have become more diverse. At the most recent awards in November 2023, Tracy Chapman made history as the first Black woman to win Song of the Year for “Fast Car,” and K. Michelle was lauded as one of the most exciting artists of the night for her performance of “Love Can Build a Bridge’’ with Jelly Roll. But the show now faces a different criticism: The CMA Awards, and the governing body that organizes them, paint a picture of country music as being more inclusive than the genre actually is today. Who gets to define country music? As my colleague Aja Romano pointed out last summer, right-wing musicians have created some of country’s biggest hits of late. Artists like Morgan Wallen, who infamously used the n-word , and Jason Aldean, who made a song that critics say insinuates lynching , have found a sturdy, loyal audience and chart-topping success. It seems that politically, the genre has been embracing more and more conservative territory. Country music isn’t a monolith, but for artists, it doesn’t exactly pay to be different. This was painfully reinforced in the wake of Beyoncé releasing “Texas Hold ’Em” in February of this year, when an Oklahoma radio station refused to play the song and implied that Beyoncé was not or could not be a country artist. The track listing for Cowboy Carter . Beyoncé/Instagram Beyoncé coming back to country, and bringing the spotlight and her fans with her, feels less like an exploration of the genre and more like a revolution. Not unlike how Renaissance highlighted the history of people of color helping to create and perpetuate house music, Cowboy Carter offers up the same opportunity for mainstream culture to acknowledge just how much country music owes its sound and history to Black artists. Beyoncé is taking up space in a place where she isn’t “supposed” to be — challenging the presumptions of who she is, what music she makes, what country music is, and who gets to make it. Judging by how unwelcome the genre made her feel in 2016, the right-wing nature of some of its current stars, and the current status quo, that act of resistance is likely going to be met with friction. “It’s what I call the metaphorical leash,” says Gheni Platenburg , a professor at the University of Houston. Platenburg studies race in media, and part of her research has focused on how Black female celebrities and entertainers are portrayed. She tells Vox that across every industry, Black women often find themselves in a trap of sorts where they’re encouraged and even expected to be their authentic selves, but never in a way that threatens the fragility of those in power. “Authenticity is something that we say that we want, but if it goes a bit too far or pushes against the sensibilities of those who were in positions of power, then it’s seen as a problem. And Beyoncé is not the first Black woman to walk this tightrope,” Platenburg notes. She adds that in her and Beyoncé’s native Houston, country and cowboy culture is multicultural. In the sphere of country music, female artists, and Black female artists especially, have found it difficult to ascend to the top of the charts and get plays on country radio. There isn’t just racism, but also inherent sexism within country music’s design. “Country radio has always had a problem with female artists, period. And there’s an idea that the male audience is only listening to male performers. That’s why you are getting so many more of them, because they appeal to a broader audience,” says Randall, the songwriter and professor. The numbers are relative, but Black men have, despite a system that doesn’t work in their favor, made it to the top of the country charts and seen their songs played in a way few Black women have. The likes of Jimmie Allen , Kane Brown , and Darius Rucker have held the top spot on Billboard’s country songs chart, but it wasn’t until late February of this year that Bey became the first Black woman in history to do the same. “And the question is: Who is the audience for Black women?” Randall asks. “Are they willing to see a Black woman as their surrogate?” They should. Country has thematically embraced the ideas of the difficulty of life, family hardships, persevering through self-minded toughness, faith in God, and self-taught rebellion. Wouldn’t an American Black woman be able to speak to those things firsthand? Beyoncé already knows the answer and is ready to show us. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","The latest season of The Bachelor concluded with an emotional proposal and an exciting announcement: For the first time in the franchise’s more than 20-year history, there will be an Asian lead . While 26-year-old Jenn Tran’s coming tenure as the newest Bachelorette made many fans happy , the announcement has others downright furious and some feeling anxious. The anxiety about ABC’s decision has been clear online this week. When one X user wrote , “PLEASE PROTECT JENN FROM THE RACI$M of bachelor nation,” almost 5,000 users liked the post, with one replying that they could “ already feel it .” Why are die-hard fans of the show already concerned about the treatment of the first Asian Bachelorette? “The franchise is problematic. We know that,” said Ashley Tabron, who runs the popular AshTalksBach Bachelor fan account on Instagram . It took the show 15 years to cast its first non-white lead, and interviews with former Black contestants have long revealed that the show has a race problem. A racial reckoning ousted longtime host Chris Harrison three years ago, and just this season, producers were silent on questions about the show’s embedded racism. However, Tabron says that ABC is at least “attempting” to improve casting , story editing, and screen time — production elements that have historically favored white contestants . But the problem doesn’t end there, as Tabron explains: “It doesn’t seem like the fan base is responding to that.” The massive audience known as “Bachelor Nation” is many things, and it’s hard to paint with a broad brush. It’s a machine that’s eager to boost its favorite contestants or quick to tear down an unruly villain — and it’s notorious for its overt racism . New data shows that there’s still plenty of reason to believe that Bachelor Nation is overwhelmingly more supportive of and interested in white contestants. Look no further than the contestants’ social media followings. Before we delve into the numbers, it’s important to understand why social media followings mean so much in Bachelor-world: money. “Now that social media for this show has really seen a comeback, the monetization of social media is key,” said Suzana Somers, who runs Bachelor Data , Bachelor Nation’s go-to data analysis platform. Followers translate into career and financial opportunities for contestants, allowing them to create promotional content for major brands and develop online personas that help them launch their own products and projects. An influencer marketing agency estimated in 2020 that Bachelor influencers with more than a million followers can earn around $10,000 for a single sponsored Instagram post or story and between $500,000 and $1 million in a year. Bachelor influencers with about half a million followers can bring in an estimated $20,000 to $50,000 per month, the firm found. As much as viewers want to believe contestants go on the show simply to find love — the so-called “right reason” — aspirations of online influence and notoriety are major motivations for contestants. In turn, their hard work and more importantly brand partnerships keep the franchise’s fandom alive online. “When a contestant hits a certain milestone, follower-wise,” said Somers, “it can become a very big financial opportunity for them.” Previous Bachelorettes and contestants have been able to unlock high follower counts and opportunities. JoJo Fletcher, a contestant on the 20th season of The Bachelor in 2016 and the lead on the 12th season of The Bachelorette that same year, has 2.6 million followers on Instagram and hosts regular product giveaways through partnerships with home furniture brand Abbyson Home and others. She’s also founded a spirits company, launched home decor and clothing lines, hosted a reality TV show for the USA Network, and partnered with brands such as recipe platform Yummly and Walmart. Season 23 contestant and former 2019 bachelorette Hannah Brown boasts 2.7 million followers on Instagram, and has erected an empire with a Dancing with the Stars season win, New York Times best-selling books, a podcast, and recent sponsorship deals with beverage company Flying Embers, cheese brand Athenos, and pharma giant AstraZeneca. Bachelorette Jenn Tran speaks to host Jesse Palmer at the “The Women Tell All.” Disney/John Fleenor Follower count is directly correlated to a contestant’s screen time and the nature of the screen time they receive. More screen time means a greater chance of being known to viewers, although a negative storyline usually hurts follower count (but can sometimes help). Ultimately, though, follower counts reveal who the fan base is excited about. “We fall in love with these contestants when they’re on the show. And when we follow them, we want insights into their lives. We want to live with them,” said Somers. “This is the purpose of reality TV, for us to live in somebody else’s life and experience their stories and find a way to relate.” “Instagram follower counts aren’t everything, but they give us a sense of whose stories we are invested in and whose stories we want to continue to follow,” said Tabron. Data across seasons, collected in real time by Somers, supports the idea that Bachelor Nation is not as interested in following contestants of color online. Somers noticed the racial trend when she first began collecting data during Colton Underwood’s 2019 season of The Bachelor . Contestant Tayshia Adams, who is Black and would go on to become the franchise’s second Black lead in 2020 after Rachel Lindsay in 2017, did not gain the kind of following that white contestants on the season did. “The trend was that if you got a one-on-one date, that would translate to more followers. But that didn’t hold with Tayshia,” Somers said. “Even with someone as beautiful and amazing as Tayshia, if you are white, you are going to get more followers than if you are not white.” Though Tayshia has now built her Instagram following to 1.4 million (the only Black lead to have more than 1 million followers), it’s important to view her growth in comparison to her white counterparts in real time. During Colton’s season, the final four women were Cassie Randolph, Hannah Godwin, Caelynn Miller-Keyes, and Tayshia; all three white women had follower counts that fell between about 500,000 and 700,000, while Tayshia had less than 100,000. “You will not find a season where a person of color contestant is ahead of all the other white contestants, even if they’re [finalists],” said Somers. Some viewers have tried to argue that the contestants and leads of color don’t have as many followers because they’re “boring” or simply not doing enough to grow their audiences. But this is the double-edged sword faced by many women of color on reality TV, including shows like Love is Blind : be boring or risk being bad for everyone. “As women of color, they have to navigate more when they’re onscreen,” said Tabron. “There are all kinds of stereotypes they’re fighting because they aren’t just representing themselves but their entire communities. They have to be more conscious of how they’re being portrayed.” Somers crunched the numbers on Instagram follower counts for the season 28 cast of The Bachelor and found record-setting engagement, challenging the narrative that the “ Bachelor-to-influencer pipeline is dead .” Leading contestants on the latest season surpassed 500,000 followers on Instagram while the show was still airing, a new feat. Still, the social media gains have mostly been shared by the season’s white contestants. This season, Daisy Kent, a crowd favorite runner-up from Becker, Minnesota, became the first to surpass 500,000 followers, and now hovers at around 747,000 days after her hot-seat interview during the finale. Maria Georgas, who gained a cult following for standing up to bullies on the show, is now at 593,000. Winner Kelsey Anderson shot up to 550,000 Instagram followers days after the finale. These numbers are groundbreaking, according to Somers. But contestants of color haven’t fared the same. Though Asian contestants broke barriers in their own right this season when it came to social media and representation on the show, Bachelor fandom isn’t recognizing them with follows — an extension of what Black contestants have experienced since being made leads. Following the finale, Jenn Tran has the fourth-highest number of followers — 164,000 — although she only crossed the 100,000 mark after being announced the Bachelorette. Rachel Nance, one of Joey’s final three contestants who was sent home after the coveted overnight date, is of Filipino and African American descent and has around 90,000 followers days after the finale. On “The Women Tell All” episode, which aired on March 18, Nance opened up about receiving racist messages from fans online. Jenn and Rachel’s stunted online growth somewhat mirrors Charity Lawson’s, the franchise’s fourth Black Bachelorette, who despite leading season 27 and making it to the finals of Dancing with the Stars , has fewer than 300,000 followers. These numbers show race is still the elephant in the room for Bachelor Nation. “The leads and contestants of color do so much on their platforms after the show,” said Tabron. “Charity, she’s done so much. Anybody else that would have done what she’s done that wasn’t Black would have a million followers. The only difference is race.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known on the street as AMLO, took a strident tone during his sit down with CBS’s 60 Minutes on Sunday. He threatened to flood the U.S. border with even more migrants if the U.S. does not acquiesce to his demands including the following : AMLO wants $20 billion a year for poor countries in Latin America and the Caribbean; citizenship for the millions of Mexicans illegally living inside the U.S.; and sanctions to be lifted against both Cuba and Venezuela, including the longstanding Cuban Embargo . He doesn’t ask for much. Obrador’s performance was a study in third- world political communication and revealed a thuggish side to the Mexican leader and his national inferiority complex. He refused to acknowledge that drugs, including deadly fentanyl, are being made inside Mexico. He didn’t stop there, he then went on to claim that Mexicans are not drug-addicted like Americans because their culture and families are superior to those of Americans (so, why do millions of them walk hundreds of miles through deserts to get to the U.S.?). Will he take action against the cartels? AMLO was defiant. No, he will not. This is, of course, a continuation of AMLO’s previously stated policy that Mexico will not serve as the police force of any foreign military. But he also refuses to allow the U.S. to take its own actions against the drug pushers along the border who are poisoning our country. Naturally, the CBS journalist conducting the interview missed any number of opportunities to ask hard questions like, “ Why is one-third of your country under the control of drug cartels?” “Why are your schools so poor that teachers and families have to pool their money to plug leaks and keep roofs from caving in on the kids?” “Why does Mexico expect open borders from the U.S. but put American residents in Mexico through the bureaucratic ringer to get a residency card ?” Even having an expired tourist card in Mexico can get you arrested, fined, deported, and/or years in prison. In beach towns all over Mexico, immigration police go out daily looking for Americans drinking and dancing in the bars and cantinas who lack papers or who have overstayed their visas. Open borders? Apparently not. Mexico Smells of Death The fact is, Mexico, for all of its lovely beaches and weather, is, internally, a wreck and ruin. The murder rate in Mexico is four times higher than that of the United States. Drugs and murder are common. Meth-pushing cartels and their lethal rule have almost totally supplanted law and order within the country. In the open wastelands of the desert, armed thugs lie in wait for passing cars. In the lifeless towns of Sinaloa and Guerrero, young male gang members sing narcocorrido songs, drug ballads, to each other in the windless afternoon, while across the way, in an old church bleached white by sand and sun, aged women pray for peace to Santa Muerte, Our Lady of the Holy Death, while the sound of gunshots tells of a blood siesta playing out across town. In the hills above, drug lords bathe new inductees in the blood of animals, and recruits murmur oaths to a different God. The whole country wears the scent of death. Its weary population numbly watches on, both outraged at the carnage and resigned to it. They are tired of trying. Even the government has given up. In just the past nine years, 160,000 Mexicans have been murdered , many at the hands of drug lords and their sicarios. In the 2018 elections, an astonishing 132 political candidates were assassinated by criminal groups. Others were threatened, causing hundreds of polling stations to be closed for fear of violence against voters and election workers . An American acquaintance was recently framed for drug possession by cops while vacationing in Cancun. He’d gone out to a bar one evening. A cop had stuck a joint in the pocket of his pants, arrested him, and forced him to pay $500 to be released. These kinds of events are common in Mexico now, even in places once thought safe for tourists. The wise foreigner stays in after dark and trusts no one. And the rule among expats is: “Do not get arrested here.” Because if you do, you’re going to be given the third degree, and forced to pay extortionate fees to get loose again. In Mexico, wrote William S. Burroughs many years ago, a policeman commands about much respect as a train conductor. As a result, an estimated 90 percent of all crimes committed in Mexico go unreported. AMLO’s Policies Should Have Gotten Him Impeached Long Ago Making everything worse is AMLO’s psychotic policy of abrazos no balazos , or “hugs, not bullets.” In other words, fighting crime by not fighting it at all and hoping the decades- old pandemic of violence will burn itself out — an approach that does not appear to be working. In a healthy country, that kind of policy would secure his impeachment, along with a visit to a shrink to have his head examined. Though Mexico is a trillion-dollar economy, it certainly doesn’t feel like one, or even a place with a future. Rather, it feels like a place where hopelessness has settled in, whose citizens have accepted that things will not get better, and probably will get worse. I’ve felt the same despair in places like Egypt and Haiti. With the public exhausted, and politicians and law enforcement unable or unwilling to crack down on the drug barons and their hoodlums, the bad guys know they hold all the cards. Watching Obrador bat away question after serious question during the painful 60 Minutes interview while engaging in open blackmail against the United States, which has done more to help Mexico economically than any other country in its history, it occurred to me that AMLO’s arrogance is not just third-world nationalism — rather, he has no respect for our first magistrate, Joseph Robinette Biden. A responsible U.S. President, one with some spine , would call up AMLO and tell him to knock it off with the public threats, that political blackmail is not how you get what you want, nor is it something one expects from a friend. Of course, Biden won’t do that. Just like AMLO, he doesn’t care. He just wants to manage his country’s decline, enjoy the trappings of power, retire rich, and be damned to his country’s fate. That’s what these two old men have in common. Obrador, like numerous other world leaders, has our President’s number. They know they can jerk Biden around, make threats, meddle in our internal affairs, and nothing will happen. We can be sure that AMLO, like Putin, is hoping Biden gets reelected."
"1","“H oly Week is a small pilgrimage to the Holy Land,” said Fr. Juan María Solana, LC, director of the Magdala Center in St. Mary Magdalene’s hometown of Migdal, Israel. “It’s accompanying Jesus more or less in a chronological and geographical order in what pertains to his passion.” Holy Week — from Palm Sunday to the Easter Triduum — is the highest liturgical feast for Catholics throughout the world. It is, as Fr. Solana says, a spiritual pilgrimage to the Holy Land, inviting Catholics to enter into the mystery of Christ’s passion. Easter recurs yearly, but each celebration draws the Church into the singular, eternally present occasion of Christ’s sacrifice and resurrection. It is not just a spiritual feast, but a physical one as well. Christ really did die and rise, and he did so in Jerusalem. With Israel at war since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, Holy Week and Easter in the Holy Land look different than in years prior. The Israel–Hamas war has greatly decreased the number of pilgrims and tourists who would otherwise attend Holy Week liturgies, and it has dramatically shaped the Easter celebrations of Christians throughout the Holy Land. Subdued Celebrations in Jerusalem Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, presided over the traditional Palm Sunday celebrations in Jerusalem, though only about 3,000 people attended — far fewer than previous years. Christians joined the traditional procession from Gethsemane that marks the beginning of Holy Week, following the path of Christ’s entry into Jerusalem 2,000 years ago. “Even though we are few, it is important that there has been this triumphant entry,” Cardinal Pizzaballa said . “We have many problems, but we are truly happy that Jesus is our Lord! He is our joy and our strength.” Cardinal Pizzaballa advocated for permits to allow Palestinian Christians to celebrate Holy Week in Jerusalem. “We insisted, saying that as they had given permits to Muslims for Ramadan, they should also give them to Christians for Easter,” he said . “Even if the numbers are smaller, we will have several thousand permits both for Palm Sunday and for Easter.” A number of Palestinian Christians from the West Bank had hoped to attend the Palm Sunday liturgy outside Jerusalem. Though 2,000 permits were issued, Catholic News Agency reported that only a limited number of Christians from the Palestinian territories were able to travel on such short notice. “It will be a difficult Easter,” Cardinal Pizzaballa said . “I think of the loneliness of Jesus in Gethsemane, which is now shared by all of us.” Gazan Christians Seek Shelter in Churches In Gaza, Church officials report about 750 Christians remaining in the region. Prior to Oct. 7, the number of Christians hovered around 1,017. Since Hamas attacked Israel, several hundred Christians have fled Gaza, and 31 have died from wounds, illness, or artillery. The National Catholic Register reports that nearly all Gazan Christians have been displaced from their homes, and many have taken shelter at Holy Family Catholic Church or the Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius. In October, St. Porphyrius — the oldest church in Gaza — was hit by a strike on Gaza City, killing 18 people and wounding at least 20 of the 400 displaced civilians sheltering in the church complex. “There is no safe place in Gaza, so we put our faith in Jesus during this Holy Week to give courage and to stop this war. We pray for peace, for justice, without revenge,” said Fr. Gabriel Romanelli, a parish priest of Holy Family Church who has been unable to rejoin his flock in Gaza since the war began. On Oct. 6, Fr. Romanelli was in the West Bank to get medication for the parish’s sisters. Israel closes border crossings on Shabbat, and the surprise attack on Oct. 7 caused Israel to seal its border with Gaza, leaving Fr. Romanelli marooned. Despite requests from the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, the Israeli government has not allowed Fr. Romanelli to return to Gaza, so he has remained in Jerusalem since the war’s beginning. With Fr. Romanelli away, Fr. Youssef Asaad is the sole priest at Holy Family. The Catholics at the parish pray, say the rosary, and celebrate Mass each day, though the church’s supply of sacramental wine is running very low due to Gazan prohibitions on selling alcohol. Pope Francis Writes to Holy Land Catholics Before Easter Amidst tribulation, Pope Francis has not forgotten his flock in the Holy Land and frequently calls Cardinal Pizzaballa. On March 27, just prior to the start of the Triduum, Pope Francis wrote a letter to Catholics living in the Holy Land, expressing his daily prayers “Easter, the heart of our faith, is all the more significant for you who celebrate this feast in the very places where our Lord lived, died, and rose again,” Pope Francis wrote . “The history of salvation, and indeed its geography, would not exist apart from the land in which you have dwelt for centuries.” He expressed the Church’s solidarity with Christians suffering in the Holy Land and thanked bishops, priests, and religious for serving communities amidst deep suffering. Jerusalem is far from home for American Catholics, but the Scriptures and the celebration of Christ’s passion, death, and resurrection nonetheless bring it close to the heart. Though the ongoing war has led to an Easter for Holy Land Christians that is, in Pope Francis’ words, “so overshadowed by the Passion,” all Christians can trust that their sufferings will be redeemed by Christ’s resurrection, which no war can take away.

"1","Boston University, Tufts, Wellesley College, and Yale aren’t the four best schools in the United States — just the four most expensive ones. The private schools each charge in excess of $90,000 for the 2024–2025 school year, the Boston Globe reveals. If you went to any of those schools, then you know that means a four-year degree now adds up to more than $360,000. Speech isn’t the only thing not free on college campuses. Sixty years ago, the average cost of college at a four-year institution approached $1,300, or about $12,000 in current dollars. What changed? Most obviously, our dollar is worth their dime. The Federal Reserve, with the encouragement of profligate legislators and presidents, inflated the currency. One can maybe blame university economics departments for teaching harebrained ideas regarding money. But it seems more honest to just to give them a pass and put the blame on the central bankers for that. An answer more germane to the universities comes from a 2021 academic journal article titled — of all things — “What’s that smell? Bulls*** jobs in higher education.” The authors of the Review of Social Economy article point out that “between 1976 and 2018, the number of full-time faculty employed at colleges and universities in the US increased by 92%, during which time total student enrollment increased by 78%. During this same period, however, full-time administrators and other professionals employed by those institutions increased by 164% and 452%, respectively. Meanwhile, due in part to the proliferation of part-time and adjunct faculty, the percentage of full- time faculty decreased from 67% to 54%, whereas the percentage of administrators who were full-time increased from 96% to 97%.” What do these people do? Some act as ideological commissars. We learned earlier this year that the University of Michigan boasts more than 500 diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) full- and part-time positions costing around $30 million annually. This does not include administrators paid to ensure compliance with Title IX and other civil-rights ukases. Tabbye Chavous , the university’s top diversity administrator, makes $402,800 annually — more than the president of the United States. Other administrators, adopting the role of Your Cruise Director Julie McCoy , work in something called “student life.” The University of Iowa, Louisiana State University, and the University of Missouri all boast “lazy rivers” — a metaphor, one gathers, for campus life. Baylor students enjoy a 53-foot climbing wall. Washington University in St. Louis features chair massagers in its “Zen Den.” Schools strongarm enormous sums from students and their parents. Where do they get the money? So much of it comes from the federal government. The more Washington doles out in student aid, the more lavish the campus perks and nonsense administrative jobs. In fact, rather than reduce the cost of college, increased aid neatly correlates with an increased burden imposed by schools on the parents and students paying for a four-year degree. Yale, Wellesley, Tufts, and BU charge what they can get away with charging — understanding that imposing more costs creates incentive for politicians to increase aid, which encourages more costs, which encourages more aid, which encourages more costs, and so on. Still, the president, not understanding moral hazard, incentives, or supply and demand, keeps exacerbating the problem he pretends to solve. As a calculation error by the Department of Education delays financial aid for students, the president, in seeming defiance of an earlier Supreme Court decision , last week erased the student loan debts of teachers, nurses, firefighters, cops, and other employees of government. This comes atop a February boast that the administration “approved nearly $138 billion in student debt cancellation for almost 3.9 million borrowers through more than two dozen executive actions.” This is a subsidy of the $402,800 DEI commissar at Michigan and the LSU lazy river. None of it lowers the cost of college for anyone anywhere. We know this because the government keeps pouring more and more tax dollars to decrease college costs, and college costs continue to speed past rates of inflation. Somewhere someone laughs. He wears tweed, a turtleneck, and wire-rimmed glasses."
"1","Jamaal Bowman ought to be a household name, but he isn’t. Outside of New York, very few people know who he is. It’s not that Bowman, a ridiculously awful Democrat congressman from Yonkers, is noteworthy for anything good he’s done. There isn’t anything good he’s done. He’s utterly without significant legislative accomplishments. In fact, what Bowman is known for is that he’s the member of Congress who pulled a fire alarm to save the Democrats from losing a vote on a continuing resolution that would fund the government with a few budget cuts he didn’t like. Then he told a ridiculous and completely implausible lie about the fire alarm, that somehow he was trying to open a door and pulling the lever on the alarm would do that. Nobody believed Bowman, who is also by the way the only male member of The Squad, the hardcore left- wing Democrat Socialists of America coven in Congress whose better-known members include Ilhan Omar, AOC, and Rashida Tlaib. In fact, he was charged with a misdemeanor, namely of willfully or knowingly falsely pulling a fire alarm, and he agreed to pay a $1,000 fine and apologize to the Capitol Police. When what he was really doing was interfering with the procedure of Congress, which is the crime for which a great many of the Jan. 6 protesters are sitting in what can best be described as a gulag of federal prisons more than three years after the fact. A dozen members of Congress, noting that what Bowman was attempting to do as a member of Congress was to interrupt the good order of the House’s proceedings — when our political process contains mechanisms for interruptions that Bowman was not interested in taking because those mechanisms involve personal accountability and actual argumentation — attempted to expel him from the House for his actions. But the bulk of the Republican caucus balked at that, and Bowman got off virtually scot-free. He didn’t suffer any serious consequences for his actions. Instead, the House of Representatives did. Because what happened next was that Tlaib essentially sponsored a pro-Hamas rally in the Capitol rotunda after the atrocities of Oct. 7 and while Hamas was holding on to more than a few Americans as hostages.

Rashida Tlaib to crowd moments before pro- Hamas insurrectionists stormed US Capitol: ""A lot of people are not gonna forget this!” pic.twitter.com/uhGadtIm63 — Danny De Urbina (@dannydeurbina) October 18, 2023 So the consequence of not maintaining the good order of the House of Representatives with Bowman was that Tlaib led a bunch of marauding nuts into the Capitol to shout genocidal “From the river to the sea!” rhetoric . And not without some violence; three of the nuts attacked Capitol Police officers. Tlaib was censored. Not expelled. And the escalation by the Squad continues. This time, it’s Bowman again. “There was propaganda used in the beginning of the siege,” Bowman told a Nov. 17 rally of about 50 pro- Palestinian protesters in Westchester. “There’s still no evidence of beheaded babies or raped women. But they still keep using that lie [for] propaganda.” — Daniel Lippman (@dlippman) March 26, 2024 The point is that these people get worse and worse, for two reasons: first, they belong to a political movement that is so utterly radical that it recognizes no limits to its excesses, and second, no outside actor has moved to create the kinds of consequences that would temper and moderate their lunacy. This isn’t just about The Squad. It’s happening all over society. We won’t invest resources into upholding standards, and so those crumble around us. People dress like slobs, they treat each other horribly, and rates of obesity, gambling, drug abuse, alcoholism, divorce, child abuse, and countless other social ills have skyrocketed. On Thursday, I did a podcast interview with Dr. Randall Bock about Racism, Revenge and Ruin: It’s All Obama , and this issue of failing to impose consequences or even remotely push back against abuse and radicalism (Barack Obama’s two terms as president were a case study in that) featured pretty prominently in the discussion. As discussed in the interview, in politics, it’s the radicalism. And things are so topsy-turvy that when an Elon Musk, for example, suggests that refusing to “trans” a kid, or promoting a balanced federal budget, or insisting that our cities don’t become crime-infested sewers strewn about with fecal matter and used hypodermic needles, replete with homeless bums and carjackers and organized gangs of looters replacing shoppers in their stores, he’s derided as a “right-winger” for his trouble. Musk was asking for basic standards. To enforce basic standards, there have to be consequences for failing to meet them. And everything about the modern Democrat Party is about escaping such standards. Use abortion for birth control, because you’re using sex for entertainment. Deny the consequences of both — and those consequences are real, and they will come. But when they do, there’s a therapeutic, redistributive government to make it all better. Rinse and repeat. There is no such thing as a consequence-free life. One purpose of civilization is to harness and control the consequences of bad behavior in ways that might contain its impact. But we’re losing that. We don’t hold political leaders, or our rich elites (hey, have we ever seen the list of Jeffrey Epstein’s clients we’ve been asking for?) responsible for bad deeds, and so the bad deeds multiply. And what we get is a society that’s crumbling. We get Jamaal Bowmans and Rashida Tlaibs multiplying as members of Congress. We get Sam Bankman-Frieds running scams where productive commerce should be. We get charlatans and bums in charge of cultural institutions like Disney. And three-quarters of us tell polling organizations what we can see and feel: the results are unacceptable. The country is on the wrong track and our civilization is dying. Well, those are the consequences writ large of failing to impose consequences for the bad acts writ small. Go from broken-windows policing to defunding the police, and what you get is chaos. Prosecute the Daniel Pennys instead of the criminal marauders on the streets and in the subways and what you get is a wake for Jonathan Diller. Fail to uphold property rights in the cities and what you get is a squatter epidemic across the country, or roving bands of looters utterly destroying urban retail. We’re suffering large consequences because we lack the will — and in the case of the Left, the motivation, or worse, the recognition of the bad act as bad — to impose them on a small scale. You can’t avoid consequences forever. They will come. A society has rules for a reason. And we’re rediscovering that basic lesson more and more as things fall apart in America.

"1","S o the other day there in the vast wasteland that is MSNBC, there was one host after another calling former RNC chair Ronna McDaniel an “election denier. A sample: Mika Brzezinski: McDaniel is “an anti-democracy election- denier”. Rachel Maddow: McDaniel was “about undermining elections and going after democracy.” Nicole Wallace: “NBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections.” And back when Mike Johnson was elected by House Republicans to be speaker, there was Joe Scarborough assailing the House Republicans by saying: “They’re all election deniers up there.” And on and on this kind of authoritarian craziness went. This being the case, it is worth recalling for the record just what the real record at MSNBC is on election denial. As noted here in the U.K.’s Guardian : Maddow was not only certain that Russians had rigged the election. On air, she would talk about the “continuing operation” – the idea that the Kremlin was controlling the Trump presidency itself. In more sober times, this brand of analysis would barely cut it on a far-right podcast. In the Trump era, it was ratings gold. In addition, MSNBC’s Joy Reid tweeted out about “the evidence of collusion with Russia.” The Federalist’ s Margot Cleveland recalled: Don’t forget MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, who gave air time to Jonathan Chait to push the possibility that “Donald Trump has been a Russian intelligence asset since 1987.” … Doing double duty for NBC and MSNBC, so-called reporter Ken Dilanian kept the collusion conspiracy going, even if it meant reporting fake news, such as the bombshell “that Russian-linked operatives had approached the Trump team in 2016 with access to a looming email dump.” False. To cut to the chase? MSNBC is the headquarters of election deniers. Laughably paranoid, resolutely authoritarian — some would say fascist. In fact, appearing on Larry Kudlow’s Fox Business show, Breitbart ’s Alex Marlow said just that. Breitbart reported : Marlow said, “We are having such a blast at Breitbart with this story. This is so fun. It just exposes the fascists over at MSNBC and NBC News for exactly who they are. They are totalitarians. Look at all of them crybabying, they cannot handle Ronna McDaniel Larry. They’re so close minded. That is too much for them.” Exactly. What is especially pathetic here is that all of this nonsense appears on NBC. NBC is, for those unfamiliar, the oldest major broadcast company in the United States, as it was founded in 1926. In the almost 100 years since, it has racked up a serious record with serious journalism, sports coverage, and more. Its journalism stars over the decades included the legendary “Huntley/Brinkley” evening news show with co-anchors Chet Huntley and David Brinkley. As they faded after decades, there was Tom Brokaw in the news anchor chair. Over at its Sunday Meet the Press show, its starring hosts ranged from the redoubtable founder Lawrence Spivak to Bill Monroe and on. Particularly notable was the hosting era of Tim Russert. It was well known for journalists asking serious questions and never ducking when it came to putting on guests of all political persuasions. But now? As quite vividly seen these last few days, the network has become nothing more than a seriously left-wing, decidedly partisan redoubt. Whether it was the reams of election-denying air time pushing the Trump–Russia collusion hoax, or recoiling in terror at the idea of having former RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel as a colleague, the network is being effectively trashed by its own employees. The message has been sent. Even if asked, now highly unlikely, no Republican in his right mind should ever venture onto any NBC program ever again. Its hosts are nothing more than bullying left-wing activists who, if they freak out at the presence of the decidedly mild and moderate Ronna McDaniel, would have serious breakdowns at any other Republican/conservative. The cast of MSNBC, in a stroke, has ruined the reputation of America’s oldest major broadcast network. Somewhere, Huntley and Brinkley are shaking their heads.

"1","T he shocking and horrific Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, triggered by the Singaporean-flagged cargo ship Dali striking it during the wee hours of Tuesday morning, has functioned as something of a Rorschach test. That test cuts to the heart of today’s hyper-online culture and a concomitant willingness — perhaps eagerness — to believe anything sensationalist even if there is no supporting evidence. To be sure, the video of the bridge collapse is truly surreal. Watching it on replay in an attempt to comprehend how this could have possibly happened in the United States of America in the year 2024, I could not help but think of the old Japanese Godzilla movies and the mid- century depictions of mass urban destruction that now look so fake to moviegoers’ eyes. Amid such a stupor, and perhaps especially just a few days after the horrific ISIS massacre in Moscow that left at least 140 dead and 360 more injured, it is not at all unreasonable to openly ponder that very question: How ? Within hours, social media was buzzing with wild speculation and the promotion of innumerable “alternative” explanations for how Dali took down the Francis Scott Key Bridge. Perhaps it was a cyberattack; perhaps the ship’s captain and crew were incompetent, hired as a result of affirmative action and the “diversity” agenda; perhaps they were hostile foreign agents who infiltrated Synergy Marine Group, Dali’s owner; or perhaps the tragedy was an “inside job” intended to manufacture a crisis that President Joe Biden could then exploit in a presidential election year. Also within hours, though, we had enough information to know what happened: Dali, which was captained by a highly trained and experienced local pilot, lost power in a tragic fluke incident. The Dali pilot actually had the foresight to issue a mayday distress signal, thus allowing local law enforcement and highway patrol to scamper to close off the bridge. Every innocent life lost is of course a tragedy, but it is still somewhat remarkable that one of the most traversed bridges in the entire “Acela Corridor” collapsed like a toy and only six people are presumed dead because of it. Many continued to promote baseless “alternative” explanations anyway, inconvenient facts notwithstanding. In fairness, we live in an age when many explanations initially dismissed by elites as “conspiracy theories” end up being true. The Wuhan lab-leak origins of the COVID-19 virus and the authenticity of Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop both come to mind as but two recent examples. But in both those cases, there was no reason to dismiss the underlying claims out of hand absent an ideological reason for doing so: politically driven fear of enraging China or somehow fomenting anti- Asian racism in the first case, and a transparent political desire for Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump in the latter case. “Alternative” explanations for the Dali catastrophe, by contrast, bear a closer resemblance to Alex Jones’ infamous rants that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a “false flag” operation. Note to the hyper-online: Sometimes a so-called conspiracy theory is just an actual conspiracy theory. In today’s age of social media, when the perverse incentive is for clout-chasing commentators and “influencers” to say the most outlandish thing imaginable (e.g., Candace Owens) to get attention, innocent users are regularly misled. This is not a victim-free phenomenon — when deliberate misleading prolongs, minds are turned to mush. Critical thinking, basic analytical skills and objective assessment of empirical data are all discarded. It can be fun or “edgy” to promote or believe a facially absurd thing, either to be a contrarian or just for the lolz. The solution is to limit your exposure to social media and do a better job of getting offline and touching grass. Get away from the cesspool of Twitter/X and Instagram, and ground yourself with family, friends, hobbies, and in-person activities. Just this week in South Florida, where I live, my wife and I attended the Miami Open professional tennis tournament and opening day for the Miami Marlins. Both events were great fun. But even something as simple as putting down the phone to go outside and breathe some fresh air will almost always be a good idea. It’s certainly helpful for avoiding the pitfalls of hyper-online culture, to say nothing of maintaining general mental sanity.

"2","This Sunday, Israel is scheduled for a political crisis. At midnight Israel time on April 1, the government will hit a deadline for changing its policy on the military draft. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will then be required to send conscription notices to roughly 66,000 ultra-Orthodox men , who had been previously exempted by a law carving out special privileges for students at religious academies, or yeshivot. This might sound like an obscure internal Israeli political fight, but it actually has the potential to alter the entire trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . The conscription issue splits Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s government apart at the seams. Netanyahu depends on ultra-Orthodox parties for his parliamentary majority; if he permits mass conscription of yeshiva students, they’ll abandon him. But if he gives the ultra-Orthodox what they want, he’ll run afoul of key members of his own right-wing Likud party, potentially prompting their defections. These scenarios both end the same way: with the collapse of Netanyahu’s governing coalition and new elections, which Likud would (per every poll) lose by a wide margin. Netanyahu’s defeat would almost certainly usher his more centrist rival Benny Gantz into power. And while some of Gantz’s policies toward the war and the Palestinians would look the same, they would likely differ on some critical issues — including the all-important questions of Gaza’s political future and a Palestinian state. Of course, potential change is just that: potential. There are many ways this scenario for real change could go awry. Netanyahu understands he is facing a major threat, and he is working overtime to come up with a solution that could postpone or even avoid the draft crisis. Even if the draft begins, it would likely be some time before it would trigger elections, creating time for polls to shift. And even if Netanyahu falls, there’s no guarantee that Gantz — a pragmatic hawk by disposition — would implement major changes to Israel’s current policy. Nonetheless, it’s clear that this issue is more of an existential threat to Netanyahu’s continued time in office than anything else since October 7. “Governments in Israel have fallen over this very issue,” says Dahlia Scheindlin, a political scientist and leading Israeli pollster. “I think it’s more serious than any [post- October 7 political] crisis we’ve had.” Given that Netanyahu’s government is one of the biggest barriers blocking the path to a true solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this is no small thing. The tricky issue of ultra-Orthodox conscription, explained In Israel’s fractured multiparty system, no one party ever commands a majority of the seats in the Knesset (legislature). Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party holds a plurality, but it needed support from smaller parties to form its current majority. These smaller parties come in two flavors: the extreme nationalist right and the ultra-Orthodox. While both types of parties are religious and socially conservative, they differ sharply in their policy priorities. Far-right nationalists’ primary concern is enshrining indefinite Israeli Jewish control over all the land between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea. Ultra- Orthodox parties, by contrast, care primarily about preserving and expanding the special rights and privileges the Israeli state accords to the ultra- Orthodox community. Of these rights, none is more important than the yeshiva exemption from the military draft. Ultra-Orthodox Jews believe that the best and most important thing a man can do is study scripture. For this reason, roughly half of all ultra-Orthodox men do no paid work , depending on government support and charity to survive. Military service in particular gets in the way of studying at a yeshiva, disrupting the traditional life of an ultra-Orthodox man. But exempting yeshiva students from military service has long struck other Israelis as deeply unfair . Why do their children have to serve, putting their lives on the line and future plans on hold, while the ultra-Orthodox sit and study? Why is attending university or entering the workplace less important than attending yeshiva? Ultra-Orthodox men demonstrate in Jerusalem against conscription on March 18, 2024. Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu/Getty Images Over the course of decades, Israeli governments have repeatedly attempted to reach some sort of policy compromise that would balance the demands of the ultra-Orthodox with the rest of Israel’s plea for “ equality of burden .” Again and again, the Israeli Supreme Court has found that these balancing acts unfairly privilege the ultra-Orthodox over other citizens, forcing the ruling government to go back to the legislative drawing board. Most recently, the Court set an April 1 deadline for conscription to begin. Politically, the timing could scarcely be worse. After October 7 and in the midst of a full-scale war, Israeli opposition to the ultra-Orthodox exemption has hit historic highs . Netanyahu is caught between a key coalition partner and most other Israelis — a tension that needs to be resolved somehow by 6 pm ET on Sunday. How this crisis might lead to Netanyahu’s fall Experts on Israeli politics see roughly three possible scenarios for how this crisis could unfold. In two of them, Netanyahu’s government falls and goes to elections that every single poll suggests he’d lose . Scenario 1: Netanyahu fails to take action before the deadline. The IDF would subsequently be required to send conscription notices to tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox men, though full enforcement would (per the Jerusalem Post ) be delayed till August. This is a red line for Shas and United Torah Judaism, the two ultra- Orthodox parties in Netanyahu’s coalition. Once conscription begins, “the two ultra-Orthodox parties will pull out of the government immediately and will call for new elections,” says Michael Koplow, the chief policy officer of the center-left Israel Policy Forum think tank. They can force these new elections by voting with the opposition parties in a motion of no confidence, as their combined forces amount to a clear majority. Scenario 2: Netanyahu comes up with a policy framework that satisfies the ultra-Orthodox but alienates key members of his own party. Netanyahu has tried to move in that direction but faced public opposition from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant , who said that a proposed legislative framework is unacceptably lenient. Netanyahu’s majority is narrow; he controls 64 out of a total of 120 seats in the Knesset. If Gallant and just four other more moderate members of the Likud support a no- confidence vote, the government collapses and elections begin. According to Scheindlin, there are enough Likud parliamentarians known to have reservations about Netanyahu that the threat of an internal rebellion is quite serious. Scenario 3: Netanyahu manages to temporarily save his government by securing an extension from the Supreme Court . To get such an exemption, Netanyahu does not need to present a full draft of an ultra-Orthodox exemption. Instead, he merely needs to convince the court that he’s making a good-faith effort to get a law they might eventually approve. To get here, Netanyahu needs to convince Israeli Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara that he’s moving toward a proposal that would pass Supreme Court scrutiny. If Baharav-Miara won’t defend the government’s position in court, that’s a very strong signal to the justices that what they’re working on is not a good-faith effort to pass a new law. This could prove difficult. Baharav-Miara reportedly believes that any legislation must include hard recruitment targets for ultra-Orthodox men — something that the ultra-Orthodox parties fundamentally oppose. If this and other impasses over policy details continue, Netanyahu may not be able to come up with something in time. The prime minister is racing against the clock. And right now, it looks like he’s losing. How the coalition’s collapse could change the course of the war If Netanyahu’s government does fall, he will not be kicked out of office immediately. Instead, he will remain in office as a caretaker prime minister until elections can be held —by law, not until three months after a government falls. That means the soonest any elections could be held is early July, and it would most likely be later than that. In the midst of a horrific war, this timeframe feels like an eternity. The people of Gaza are starving right now . Why should anyone care what happens to the Israeli government in several months? There are many possible answers to this question, but perhaps the simplest relates to how the war could end and what a subsequent peace might look like. Netanyahu has, for political and ideological reasons, taken a position on the war that is at once hardline and vague. He has repeatedly and categorically ruled out putting the moderate Palestinian Authority in charge of Gaza after the war, let alone any postwar move to a two-state solution. At the same time, he has refused to specify a serious alternative plan — or even define what victory looks like. A coalition government led by Benny Gantz’s National Unity party would almost certainly be different. Israeli Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz in Washington on March 4, 2024. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Unlike Netanyahu, who is beholden to the far right, Gantz’s coalition partners would likely range from the more mainstream right to the left. Gantz is a general by background and remains close with the security establishment; he would probably define a more concrete and limited understanding of “victory” in the Gaza war, which would likely bring it to a swifter close . And while not an ideological dove, he also is not implacably opposed to a Palestinian state. This makes him more susceptible than Netanyahu would be to the heavy pressure from Washington to make moves toward greater Palestinian self-determination. In the immediate term, that would likely lead him to move toward the US proposal for the Palestinian Authority to take over as the ruling power in Gaza after the war. In the longer run, it might lead to something even bigger. “I think that he is much more malleable and subject to pressures from the international community, especially if there is a sense of overwhelming historic inevitability brought to bear from the global community,” says Scheindlin. “I really think that could eventually lead to reopening the need for a comprehensive political resolution.” Of course, Scheindlin cautions, such a scenario is “a very long time away” from coming to fruition. Many things could prevent such a development, ranging from Netanyahu turning his poll numbers around to a Trump victory lessening international pressure on Israel . There are many sound reasons to avoid predicting things getting better in the Israel-Palestine conflict, many of which have been on heartrending display during the past six months of horror. One thing is clear: With Netanyahu in power, peace and justice are unattainable. If the fight over ultra-Orthodox conscription does bring down his government, there’s a chance — however remote — that this could change. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Evan Gershkovich , the Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia on charges of spying, just had three months added to his jail time — and he hasn’t even gone to trial yet. It’s been a year since Gershkovich, who had covered the country for five years at that point, was arrested by Russian security forces. He was on assignment in Yekaterinburg, a city in the Ural Mountains nearly 900 miles east of the Journal’s Moscow bureau. And because of Russia’s opaque and autocratic justice system, the trial — when it comes — will likely be conducted in secret. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in a Russian penal colony. The US government says he is “ wrongfully detained ” — a designation the US applies to citizens detained overseas on what it considers to be unfounded charges and whose release it is actively working to secure. While foreign reporters have been kicked out of the country since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine , and many Russian reporters have been detained , forced to flee the country , or killed while President Vladimir Putin has been in power, Gershkovich’s case is somewhat unusual in that he’s an American reporter accused of espionage. He’s the first foreign reporter detained on espionage charges since the Cold War, when US News & World Report’s Nicholas Daniloff was arrested in 1986 . Daniloff, like Gershkovich, is the child of Russian immigrants; like Gershkovich, he was also not a spy, though he did come into Soviet intelligence that he handed over to the CIA . Gershkovich’s case is emblematic of a few trends in Russia right now — not just the destruction of press freedom there, but also the use of detainees as a bargaining chip between Russia and the US. Gershkovich’s time in Russia parallels increasing repression Gershkovich’s parents fled the country during a wave of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union in the 1970s and ’80s, according to the Journal. Though he grew up in the US, he spoke Russian at home, and his childhood was tinged with Russian superstitions and cultural specificities . He moved to Russia in 2017, where he worked first for the Moscow Times and then for Agence France-Presse. As a reporter for the Journal, where he was hired in 2022, Gershkovich covered Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, its economy, and the internal politics of the Kremlin. But criticizing or truthfully reporting about the war in Ukraine became increasingly dangerous due to the Kremlin’s draconian laws against what it refers to as fake news and against disparaging the war effort. That environment forced many Western journalists and outlets covering Russia out of the country. (The BBC’s Russia bureau, for instance, is now located in Riga, Latvia, and the Russian outlet TV Rain has moved to Amsterdam.) Russian journalists have suffered even worse for years . “Since the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine, between 1,500 to 1,800 Russian journalists were forced into exile,” according to an investigation by a journalist support fund created by Reporters Without Borders. Even though Gershkovich, according to the Journal, had the appropriate accreditation from the Russian foreign ministry to work as a reporter in the country, the Federal Security Bureau (FSB, Russia’s successor to its notorious KGB spy agency) had previously followed him on other assignments , filming him while he worked and discouraging sources from talking to him. The Kremlin and FSB have claimed — without clear evidence — that Gershkovich, “acting on the instructions of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.” Gershkovich’s family, his employer, and the Biden administration have all denied that he was working as a spy, which is not an uncommon accusation against foreign journalists working in authoritarian countries. He has been denied access to the attorney the Journal hired for him and has gone through at least a dozen secret pre- trial hearings over the past year in which he has appealed for his release. Those appeals ended in an extension of his pre-trial sentence . Russia has used prisoners as political pawns before Gershkovich fits into a larger trend of the Kremlin using US citizens as pawns to achieve political goals or express displeasure — rather than using diplomatic channels. A week before Gerskovich’s arrest, the Justice Department charged Russian citizen Sergey Cherkasov with several crimes including visa fraud, wire fraud, and acting as an agent of a foreign power. Though it’s not clear the two cases are linked, Gershkovich’s arrest could have been in retaliation for Cherkasov’s indictment. There’s another American reporter currently detained in Russia: Alsu Kurmasheva , a reporter for Radio Free Europe, has been detained in Russia since June for allegedly failing to register her US citizenship while on a personal visit to see her sick grandmother. You might also remember how star basketball player Brittney Griner was arrested in a Moscow airport in February 2022 for carrying a gram of hashish oil in her luggage. Her saga — from her sham trials to her nine-year sentence to her transfer to a penal colony in Russia’s Mordovia region — merited significant attention in the US press and from the Biden administration. Griner was released in December 2022 in exchange for Victor Bout, a Russian arms trafficker nicknamed the “ merchant of death ” for his role in funneling arms to the Taliban and al-Qaeda . “The cases are often resolved through this kind of swap, and they take a long time, so it can feel hopeless when you haven’t heard any news for weeks and months and you know an American is suffering in a foreign country,” Danielle Gilbert, a professor at Northwestern University who studies hostage negotiations, told Vox in 2022 . Putin told American media personality Tucker Carlson in February that he would be open to swapping Gershkovich for a Russian currently in prison abroad; that is speculated to be Vadim Krasikov , who is serving a life sentence for the 2019 murder of a Georgian man who was living in Berlin. But releasing Krasikov is up to Germany, not the US. Gershkovich was apparently part of a prisoner swap deal that included Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny , who died in February while in detention in Siberia, as well as Paul Whelan, a former Marine who has been detained on espionage charges since 2018. That deal could have seen the three traded for Krasikov, but the deal was called off upon Navalny’s death at the hands of the Russian state. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Buying a house just doesn’t feel possible right now. Home prices have doubled in the last decade, with much of that growth happening in just the last four years. By one measure, housing affordability has fallen to its lowest level since the 1980s. And high interest rates have exacerbated the problem, ballooning monthly mortgage payments. But it’s not easier on the other side of the equation. Would-be sellers — grappling with those same high interest rates — are locked into homes that may be too small for their growing families. Parents with newly empty nests would rather stay put than pay the same amount or more for a smaller home. The result: The pandemic-era housing boom is over. Home sales in 2023 were the lowest they’ve been in nearly 30 years. “The housing market is pretty frozen in place,” the Wall Street Journal’s housing reporter Nicole Friedman told Today, Explained co-host Noel King . “There’s really kind of a standoff right now between buyers and sellers.” So how did the housing market go from frenzy to frozen in just a few years’ time? And what might turn the heat back on? What follows is the transcript of a conversation between King and Friedman, edited for length and clarity. — Amanda Lewellyn, producer Noel King Nicole, we have a very young audience, and I want you to tell us about something that I never knew about — or I never realized at all — until I got a mortgage when I was 40, which is: Interest rates actually mean something. So if I don’t know about mortgages, I might think 3 percent, 7 percent. That’s not a big deal. What does an interest rate, a higher interest rate, actually mean for a person getting a 3 percent and a person getting a 7 percent? Nicole Friedman So that type of change in interest rate is a huge difference in terms of the monthly payment. At a 3 percent interest rate versus a 7 percent rate, that can be a difference of hundreds of dollars — even maybe $1,000 difference — in what you’re paying every single month. And so that’s really, for many people, the difference between being able to buy a home or not, or being able to buy a home of a certain size or in a certain neighborhood versus not being able to afford it. Noel King Right. Because also, it’s not like you get a raise because interest rates have gone up. It’s not like any other part of your budget, or your life, gets better to account for interest rates going up. Nicole Friedman Absolutely. And that’s why we talk a lot about affordability, right? Homebuying affordability or housebuying power. The way that economists think about homebuying affordability usually is a combination of the price of the house, the mortgage rate, and income. So it’s really, what is that monthly payment going to be? And then, how much of your income does it take to pay that monthly payment? The benchmark for “affordable” is that you really shouldn’t be spending more than 30 percent of your income on your housing payment. One index that tracks housing affordability from the National Association of Realtors shows that in October, homebuying affordability fell to the lowest level since the ’80s. So even though there are times in the past when mortgage rates have been much higher than they are today, it’s really the combination of rates and prices and incomes that means that affordability is still worse. Noel King Okay, so there’s a third piece of this that is also super interesting, which is: If interest rates are high and fewer people are buying, it seems like that should mean the people selling have got to lower the prices of the houses. You have fewer buyers. “Okay, we have to compromise. We’re just going to make less money on this house.” And yet, I haven’t seen many stories saying home prices in America are super low since interest rates went up and the competition waned. What is that about? Nicole Friedman We think about just classic economics. There are two things in setting a price: There’s demand and there’s supply. The thing about higher mortgage rates and the fact that they rose as quickly as they did in 2022 — it really lowered demand. A lot of buyers stepped out of the market, but the increase in mortgage rates also lowered supply; a lot of home sellers are also buyers. There are people who are going to sell a home so that they can buy a home. And these people said, “Wait a minute. [In] my current home, I have a great mortgage rate. I have a 3 percent rate. I have a low payment. If I go back out onto the market, I’m paying a higher price for that home because prices have risen in the last couple of years and I’m paying a higher mortgage rate. I cannot afford to sell my home and buy a different one. I’m just going to stay put.” That means that the supply of homes for sale is much, much lower than normal. Any buyer who’s out on the market right now is probably noticing that there’s not a lot of inventory to choose from. That means that even though demand is down, supply is down, too. So prices really haven’t declined in most of the country. Noel King Nicole, crazy question. Are there enough houses? Nicole Friedman Everybody basically agrees there are not enough homes, because after the financial crisis, a lot of homebuilders went out of business . The ones who were left in business were really, really financially scarred by the crisis. They were left with a lot of homes they couldn’t sell and a lot of land they couldn’t sell. So builders became a lot more cautious, and the number of homes being built fell to a much lower level. It’s taken more than a decade for homebuilding activity to really catch back up. Noel King The baby boomer generation gets a lot of crap for buying the seven-bedroom house with the big backyard for seven raspberries and 40 years later, still sitting on the house. Are the boomers — God bless them, every one — are they really part of the problem, or should we leave the boomers alone? Nicole Friedman Well, every boomer would tell you that they bought it for seven raspberries, but at a 15 percent mortgage rate. I don’t think that boomers are the problem here. It is a change from past generations that the baby boomer generation is aging in place more than past generations, and they are often working longer. They’re staying healthier longer. And so they are able to stay in their homes for longer, and that’s their choice. That’s fine. But it does mean that the typical cycle of how long somebody normally stays in their home before they sell it has gotten longer. People are staying in their home for longer, and that does contribute to less turnover on this ladder of how people move through the housing market. Normally, you buy a starter home and then you move up to a bigger home and maybe eventually you downsize to a smaller home. That ladder gets a little jammed up if people don’t move as frequently. But I would also say, what’s really jamming up the gears right now are those move-up buyers. That’s going to be Generation X. These are people that are in starter homes that they bought within the last five, 10 years, and they’re looking for that next move up. There may be a young family who bought a home before they had kids — or when they had just one kid, and now they have a second child and they need another bedroom — and they want a bigger home. But those people are saying, “I can’t give up this 3 percent mortgage rate,” even though, in this “natural” cycle, they should be selling their starter home to a first-time buyer and moving into a bigger home that’s being vacated by a downsizing baby boomer. But those people are so stuck in place that they just can’t afford to make that move. Arguably, they’re really the ones right now kind of jamming up the gears. Noel King Americans are made to feel like we should buy houses. We hear all about the benefits. We hear much less about the drawbacks. What does it mean that it is starting to feel less and less accessible? This thing that once upon a time and for a long time was considered to be part of the American Dream, and now there’s an entire generation — millennials, and Gen Z hot on our heels — who feel like it just might never happen? Nicole Friedman Yeah, I think it does feel frustrating to people. People do want to own homes, by and large. There was a theory once upon a time that millennials didn’t want to own homes. I think that’s been proven wrong. Noel King We were just broke! We were just broke when they were saying that about us. Nicole Friedman Exactly. And it’s now very clear that millennials are like prior generations. They do want to own homes. Partly it is a financial investment: Homeownership is a key way to build wealth and has been, in this country, an important way to build wealth. But it’s also a very emotional thing. A lot of people want stability. They want a sense of ownership. They want to be able to paint their walls and redecorate their house, and they don’t want to worry about the rent going up, or about their landlord deciding to sell the building and them not being able to stay. Right now, that gap between what it costs to rent and what it costs to own in a lot of places is pretty out of whack. It’s just much more expensive to buy right now than it typically is. And I think that people are realizing that and trying to come to terms with what it means. But it’s also a bigger question as a society, how much we want to prioritize homeownership and homebuying affordability.

"2","This morning, Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter and the first American journalist to be arrested in Russia on espionage charges since the Cold War, woke up to his second year in prison. After five years of covering Russia, he was arrested in March 2023. It came as a shock: Though Russian journalists have long faced increasing repression and even deadly peril , international journalists “were generally a somewhat protected class,” as my former colleague Jonathan Guyer wrote one year ago . One thing Gershkovich had in common with many Russian journalists who have run afoul of the state: His arrest was bogus. Within two weeks, the US government officially designated him as “ wrongfully detained .” Reporters Without Borders (RSF), meanwhile, considers him a “ Russian state hostage .” Despite a year of pre-trial hearings and extensions on his detention, Russia has publicly provided no clear evidence to substantiate its allegations. For the media that remains in the country, it has also “had a huge chilling effect, with further self- censorship,” Jeanne Cavelier, the head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk, said over email. That all serves Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aims amid the ongoing war in Ukraine . But what’s happened to Gershkovich isn’t just about Putin. Yes, his government was already particularly bad on press freedom and has only gotten worse since Russia invaded Ukraine : Over 30 journalists in Russia are currently imprisoned because of their reporting, and “between 1,500 to 1,800 Russian journalists were forced into exile” over the last two years, according to a report by the RSF’s JX Fund . “Russia is ranked 164th out of 180 countries in the last Press Freedom Index ,” Cavelier pointed out. “It dropped another nine places last year, in the worst category of the ranking where the press freedom situation is classified as ‘very serious.’” But it would be short-sighted to think that brazen attacks on the media stop at Russia’s borders. The 2018 funeral ceremony for Yassser Murtaja, a Palestinian news reporter, who was shot by Israeli forces while covering a rally within the “Great March of Return.” Mustafa Hassona/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Impunity in action The most egregious example of what happens when there’s a sense of impunity over attacks on journalists is the Israel-Hamas war. As the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) noted in December , 68 journalists were killed in the first 10 weeks of the war — more “than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year.” That tally has only grown since . Gaza was already a difficult place to conduct independent journalism, given Hamas’s harassment, intimidation, and physical abuse of reporters . And war zones are obviously dangerous for all civilians, reporters included. But Israel has said it cannot guarantee journalists’ safety in Gaza and has denied international reporters access to the territory . Even more concerning: Critics say the Israel Defense Forces also appear to have a pattern of targeting journalists . vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Subscribe “In at least one case , a journalist was killed while clearly wearing press insignia in a location where no fighting was taking place,” CPJ reported . “In at least two other cases, journalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and IDF officers before their family members were killed.” This builds on years of broader restrictions and harassment of the media, including 20 killings of journalists by Israeli fire over the last two decades. Israel has opened investigations into many of these deaths, to be sure, but no one has ultimately been held accountable . One notable example: In 2022, Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed as she was reporting for Al Jazeera on an IDF raid in the West Bank. Independent media investigations indicated it was a deliberate attack by IDF soldiers . Israel says there is a “high possibility” a soldier shot Abu Akleh but there was “no suspicion that a bullet was fired deliberately.” (The US response to the killing of one of its citizens was slow to materialize; only six months after her death did reports break that the US had opened an investigation into her killing.) Yes, wars are dangerous to report from. With one exception , “the countries with the highest number of journalists killed for their work in any given year” — Syria in 2012, Afghanistan in 2018, Ukraine in 2022, and Somalia in 2012 — were at war or amid an insurrection, per CPJ data . But this isn’t exclusive to war zones. British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian indigenous expert Bruno Pereira were murdered in the Amazon. Joao Gabriel Alves/Picture Alliance via Getty Images The broader picture Anywhere there’s a struggle for power or even just a lot of money at stake, the media is at risk — be that from the state, non- state actors (like cartels, terrorist groups, or business interests), or an unholy union of the two. Nowhere is that clearer than in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Guatemala, for example, Q’eqchi’ Mayan journalist Carlos Choc has been subjected to years of legal intimidation and persecution in response to his reporting on the country’s mining industry. In Haiti, there are questions over whether a powerful prosecutor covered up — or even ordered — the murder of a popular radio journalist . In Ecuador, where gangs have been fighting over a newly lucrative narco industry and defying the government with increasing impunity, letter bombs were delivered last year to at least five TV and radio journalists. (Thankfully, no serious injuries were reported.) In Mexico, right before Abu Akleh’s killing, three journalists were killed in the span of three days . I’m highlighting it as a stark example of the dangers that reporters, especially those who cover politics or organized crime, face in Mexico — the most dangerous country for media workers for three years running before the outbreak of the Ukraine war. In Brazil, British journalist Dom Phillips was murdered in 2022 alongside a Brazilian activist while reporting for a book on the destruction of the Amazon. It is part of what the Guardian described as “the increasingly violent atmosphere that has gripped Brazil since the 2018 election of a president who has overseen what activists call a historic assault on Indigenous rights and the environment .” At the risk of making your eyes glaze over, I’ll stop there. This profession has never been safe. But until a decade ago or so, there was at least a sense that journalists had a recognized role in reporting from even the world’s worst conflicts — and that role afforded them some protection. The last couple of years have felt particularly grim, and the outbreak of two wars by two governments, both known to operate with impunity toward reporters, is an obvious turn for the worse.

"2","HOUSTON, Texas — In a video message projected onto massive screens in a packed conference hall, Sultan al-Jaber , the president of the COP28 climate conference held in the United Arab Emirates last year, graciously accepted a leadership award from one of the world’s biggest energy industry conventions. Al-Jaber, who when not running UN climate summits is also the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, faced criticism from environmental groups for inviting major oil and gas companies to participate in the international climate negotiations. He also faced scrutiny for his comments that it’s not necessary to eliminate fossil fuels to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming this century to less than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century. But here in Houston, before a much friendlier crowd, he remained defiant. “If the world is going to meet its climate goals, every stakeholder has to act,” al-Jaber said, with a model of a wind turbine on his desk. “Everyone had a seat at the table, everyone was invited to contribute, and everyone did contribute.” CERAWeek by S&P; Global — an annual conference of oil, gas, coal, renewable, and nuclear energy industries — returned the invitation, putting the once taboo topic of climate change in its headline. “It is no exaggeration to say that [al-Jaber] helped the global community chart pathways to a sustainable future,” said Daniel Yergin, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning oil history The Prize and the founder of CERAWeek. The conference isn’t meant to produce any formal agreements or treaties, but what attendees say on stage and behind closed doors often ripple through the global energy industry. While only a sliver of the size of the last climate meeting — more than 8,000 delegates were at CERAWeek compared to more than 80,000 attendees at COP28 — the conference represents some of the most powerful companies in the world with trillions of dollars at their disposal to shape the future of global energy and the climate. The theme this year was “Multidimensional Energy Transition: Markets, climate, technology and geopolitics.” The unwieldy title is an example of how the convention has grown in scope since it started in 1981 and how the industries it represents have begun to redefine their roles in a world constrained by rising average temperatures, yet still primarily dependent on fossil fuels . What was once a low-key meeting of oil and gas executives and analysts to talk frankly and cut deals has become a slick news-making tech conference where attendees are well fed and, after hours, well lubricated by sponsors. Think of it as Davos for the oil and gas set, hosted in the energy capital of the US. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the “momentum of the energy transition is undeniable.” Yi-Chin Lee/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images “Twenty years ago you could not have a conversation here about climate change. Full stop,” Mark Brownstein , senior vice president for energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), who has attended the conference for decades, told Vox. By now everyone at CERAWeek has gotten the memo on global warming and understood the assignment, at least in rhetoric. The world’s largest energy firms have come to a general consensus that the world is shifting toward clean energy — but that fossil fuels are still going to be necessary for the foreseeable future. “These truths are not in conflict,” said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. “The momentum of the clean energy transition is undeniable, even as we are the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.” Every talk and panel discussion nodded to the energy transition, toward carbon management, efficiency, and clean tech. When it comes to energy sources — wind, solar, hydropower, natural gas, oil, hydrogen, coal, nuclear, geothermal, and even fusion — CERAWeek has truly embraced diversity, equity, and inclusion. But even with greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere reaching levels not seen in eons and after the hottest year humans have ever measured , the fossil fuel industry whose products are driving climate change sees a bright future for itself. After all, despite the extraordinary expansion of clean energy generation , fossil fuels have only lost a small share of the global energy mix and are still expecting more growth. The majors believe that technologies like carbon capture and storage will allow them to continue selling their wares as emissions regulations ratchet down, and that power-devouring technologies like artificial intelligence and growing markets in developing countries will continue to raise demand. By some estimates, data center electricity use is on track to more than double by 2026 . Coal , oil , and natural gas consumption are at or near record highs in many parts of the world and their emissions are currently on track to grow through 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration . The world is hungry for BTUs and watts, and the energy industry is eager to serve them. “I’m actually more optimistic today than I’ve ever been in this job,” ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told attendees, noting that COP28 was the first climate conference he has ever attended. Oil companies like Chevron highlighted their efforts to decarbonize their products like gasoline at CERAWeek. Umair Irfan/Vox But that optimism hasn’t been matched with urgency on climate change, and the industry has a long history of slowing progress. While the language has changed more recently, the oil and gas industry has spent decades thwarting action on climate change, with lobbying, litigation, and misinformation. Exxon’s own scientists produced accurate internal forecasts of rising average temperatures as early as the 1970s while the company published full-page ads in newspapers casting doubt on warming into the late 1990s . Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has also put energy security back on the front burner. For some countries, energy security today matters more than climate change tomorrow, leading them to prioritize secure sources, including fossil fuels in some cases. (Energy security wasn’t the only echo of the war — CERAWeek also helpfully reminded participants in its registration form not to attend if they are subject to sanctions.) So while appetites for cleaner energy sources are growing, the stalwarts of the global energy industry have made it clear they aren’t letting go of the fuels that powered their rise. As these companies have grudgingly come to acknowledge climate change, many concerned about global warming have also begun to grapple with the likelihood that fossil fuels aren’t fading away anytime soon. And while most energy companies do envision reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, the current pace is nowhere near fast enough to bend the curve to meet climate goals. The future for the global energy industry is not just brighter, but hotter. There is a lot money to be made in new clean energy Across the skybridge from the hotel in the neighboring convention center, CERAWeek hosts what it calls Innovation Agora, where tech entrepreneurs and energy startups pitch their solutions to climate change in glass-walled booths under purple lights. It was once the kids’ table of the conference when it launched in 2017 but has since evolved into a parallel production, a clear reflection of clean energy’s massive growth and immense potential. CERAWeek’s Innovation Agora prominently features solutions to climate change. Umair Irfan/Vox “Globally, clean energy investment has overtaken fossil fuel investment every year since 2016, according to the IEA,” Granholm said. “In the US, clean energy investment has tripled since 2018.” The fossil fuel industry talks less about competition between conventional sources and renewables and more about collaboration between the “molecule” and the “electron” solution set, as Exxon’s Woods described it. The molecules are the hydrocarbons of coal, oil, and gas and increasingly, hydrogen, while the electrons are those generated by solar panels and wind turbines. “I’m not suggesting one’s better than the other one,” Woods said. “What I’m suggesting is, we need both, and you need companies who have our scale, our capabilities.” Unsurprisingly, the “molecule” companies have their eyes set on the technologies that play to their strengths. Hydrogen , a gas most commonly produced by reforming methane, fits well into the fossil fuel industry’s existing refining, pipeline, storage, and retail infrastructure. Geothermal, which harnesses heat from beneath the Earth’s surface , draws on the sector’s expertise in geology and drilling. Carbon capture — from smokestacks, from the ocean, from the air — gives fossil fuels a way to zero out their emissions, at least on paper, extending them a lifeline in a world where emissions must ratchet down. In the US, the Biden administration has set a target of cutting national greenhouse gas emissions in half compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. US government incentives are sweetening the deal for cleaner energy technologies. The trio of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , the CHIPS and Science Act , and the Inflation Reduction Act have mobilized billions of dollars to research, build, and deploy low- emissions energy systems and the products that enable them. Unlike past legislative attempts to tackle climate change, these laws are almost all incentives, with no restrictions or caps on greenhouse gases baked in. “I am very supportive of the IRA, because, as legislated, the IRA focuses on carbon intensity and in theory, [is] technology agnostic,” Woods said. As for the villains, the energy industry as well as environmental groups a common adversary in methane. It’s about 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere. It’s the dominant component of natural gas, so producers do have an incentive to limit its leaks since it’s a salable product. At COP28, dozens of oil and gas firms committed to ending their methane pollution by 2050 . Simply reducing methane output by 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 could avert 0.2°C of warming (0.36°F) by 2050. But methane is colorless and odorless, making it hard to detect where it’s escaping, and estimates of its emissions vary widely . An advertisement for EDF’s new methane-tracking satellite on the streets of Houston. Umair Irfan/Vox These concerns have fertilized the growth of the carbon accounting and verification business. Context Labs , one of the companies presenting at the Agora, has developed software so companies can track emissions across their facilities, sometimes down to individual pieces of hardware like generators or furnaces. The goal is to give companies actionable information about where they need to cut pollution, how they can route their operations to be more carbon efficient, and what assets will be at risk when emissions regulations get stricter. Not everyone is ready to take these companies at their word, though. The Environmental Defense Fund launched a satellite to track global methane emissions just a few days before CERAWeek began and advertised it on the streets of Houston. EDF plans to publish its findings publicly to spur polluters to act. Major oil producers warn of “hard realities” for the switch to clean energy There were still points of friction at the oil-soaked conference, as laid out by Amin Nasser, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco. It’s not just the world’s largest oil company , with nearly four times the market capitalization of ExxonMobil; it’s the fourth-mightiest of all companies , shaping economies around the world . And as a mostly state-run enterprise under an autocratic regime, Saudi Aramco isn’t as swayed by activists or shareholders as a fully investor-owned company like Exxon. Nasser laid out what he called five “hard realities” for the energy transition. The first is that alternatives to hydrocarbons like wind and solar energy have received decades of research and development and billions of dollars in investment, but still hold single-digit market shares . Second, reducing the carbon intensity of fossil fuels — particularly through energy efficiency and switching from coal and oil to natural gas — has delivered greater greenhouse gas emissions reductions than the rise of clean energy. Third is that many alternative energy strategies like electric vehicles are unaffordable for a majority of people around the world. That ties into the fourth point, that most of global energy demand growth in the coming years will occur in developing countries. But despite representing 85 percent of the world’s population , these countries receive a tiny fraction of clean energy investment. Nasser concluded with his fifth point: that the energy transition strategy of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy needs a reset. “We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately, reflecting realistic demand assumptions,” Nasser said to widespread applause. “We should ramp up our effort to reduce carbon emissions, improve efficiency and introduce lower carbon solutions. And we should phase in new energy sources and technologies when they are genuinely ready, economically competitive, and with the right infrastructure.” Amin Nasser, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco, said that phasing out oil and gas was a “fantasy.” Mark Felix/AFP via Getty Images Many activists and other in the energy industry disagree with Nasser’s assessment . However, his comments echo the ongoing rifts at COP meetings between major fossil fuel-producing countries that became rich off oil and those often poorer countries facing the immediate effects of climate change like sea level rise, who want to see fossil fuel consumption zeroed out. It’s led to long, tortuous negotiations over language like “phase down” versus “phase out” and “ unabated ” emissions from fossil fuels. But while many zero-carbon technologies are still expensive, so too are the systems required to keep burning coal, oil, and gas in a world where emissions must halt by the middle of the century to meet climate targets. Some of the cheapest carbon capture technologies to date still cost about $40 per metric ton of carbon dioxide , adding up to billions of dollars to capture any meaningful share of the 37.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year . The US, now the world’s largest oil producer and natural gas exporter , is also in an awkward spot. While pledging to reduce its own emissions, the US is anticipating more fossil fuel exports and financing import facilities in other countries. That includes a doubling of liquefied natural gas shipments abroad by 2030, despite the White House’s pause on new export terminals . “The whole world needs to transition away from fossil fuels, but in the meantime, we still have to support our friends and allies in their energy needs,” John Podesta, the White House climate adviser who also leads climate diplomacy, told reporters. Now in an election year, the Biden administration is trying to walk the line between taking credit for low gasoline prices and facilitating more fossil fuel extraction as it faces a challenger who wants to ramp up coal, oil, and natural gas, potentially adding another 4 billion metric tons by 2030 to the US’s already massive greenhouse gas emissions tally. All the while, the era of low interest rates that drove the massive expansion of both renewables and natural gas in the US in the past decade is ending just as the country needs a massive new buildout of energy production and infrastructure. Financing expenses are getting higher while permitting time and costs remain an obstacle, slowing down the shift to cleaner energy. So while the threats from climate change are more apparent than ever, it’s getting harder to wield the tools to keep it in check, and that means the fuels of the industrial revolution will continue to light the road ahead, for a while at least.

"2","Stars that wink at you. Protons with 11 dimensions. Computers made of rows of human soldiers. Aliens that give virtual reality a whole new meaning. All of these visual pyrotechnics are very cool. But none of them are at the core of what makes 3 Body Problem , the new Netflix hit based on Cixin Liu’s sci-fi novel of the same name, so compelling. The real beating heart of the show is a philosophical question: Would you swear a loyalty oath to humanity — or cheer on its extinction? There’s more division over this question than you might think. The show, which is about a face-off between humans and aliens, captures two opposing intellectual trends that have been swirling around in the zeitgeist in recent years. One goes like this: “Humans may be the only intelligent life in the universe — we are incredibly precious. We must protect our species from existential threats at all costs!” The other goes like this: “Humans are destroying the planet — causing climate change , making species go extinct. The world will be better off if we go extinct!” The first, pro-human perspective is more familiar. It’s natural to want your own species to survive. And there’s lots in the media these days about perceived existential threats, from climate change to rogue AI that one day could wipe out humanity. But anti-humanism has been gaining steam , too, especially among a vocal minority of environmental activists who seem to welcome the end of destructive Homo sapiens. There’s even a Voluntary Human Extinction Movement , which advocates for us to stop having kids so that humanity will fade out and nature will triumph. And then there’s transhumanism, the Frankensteinish love child of pro-humanism and anti-humanism. This is the idea that we should use tech to evolve our species into Homo sapiens 2.0. Transhumanists — who span the gamut from Silicon Valley tech bros to academic philosophers — do want to keep some version of humanity going, but definitely not the current hardware. They imagine us with chips in our brains, or with AI telling us how to make moral decisions more objectively, or with digitally uploaded minds that live forever in the cloud. Analyzing these trends in his book Revolt Against Humanity , the literary critic Adam Kirsch writes, “The anti-humanist future and the transhumanist future are opposites in most ways, except the most fundamental: They are worlds from which we have disappeared, and rightfully so.” If you’ve watched 3 Body Problem , this is probably already ringing some bells for you. The Netflix hit actually tackles the question of human extinction with admirable nuance, so let’s get into the nuance a bit — with some mild spoilers ahead. What does 3 Body Problem have to say about human extinction? It would give too much away to say who in the show ends up repping anti-humanism. So suffice it to say that there’s an anti-humanist group in play — people who are actually trying to help the aliens invade Earth. It’s not a monolithic group, though. One faction, led by a hardcore environmentalist named Mike Evans, believes that humans are too selfish to solve problems like biodiversity loss or climate change, so we basically deserve to be destroyed. Another, milder perspective says that humans are indeed selfish but may be redeemable — and the hope is that the aliens are wiser beings who will save us from ourselves. They refer to the extraterrestrials as literally “Our Lord.” Meanwhile, one of the main characters, a brilliant physicist named Jin, is a walking embodiment of the pro-human position. When it becomes clear that aliens are planning to take over Earth, she develops a bold reconnaissance mission that involves sending her brainy friend, Will, into space to spy on the extraterrestrials. Jin is willing to do whatever it takes to save humanity from the aliens, even though they’re traveling from a distant planet and their spaceships won’t reach Earth for another 400 years. She’s willing to sacrifice Will — who, by the way, is madly in love with her — for later generations of humans who don’t even exist yet. Will and Jin, star-crossed lovers (literally) in 3 Body Problem . Courtesy of Netflix Jin’s best friend is Auggie, a nanotechnology pioneer. When she’s asked to join the fight against the aliens, Auggie hesitates, because it would require killing hundreds of humans who are trying to help the aliens invade. Yet she eventually gives in to Jin’s appeals — and lots of people predictably wind up dead, thanks to a lethal weapon created from her nanotechnology. As Auggie walks around surveying the carnage from the attack, she sees a child’s severed foot. It’s a classic “do the ends justify the means?” moment. For Auggie, the answer is no. She abandons the mission and starts using her nanotech to help people — not hypothetical people 400 years in the future, but disadvantaged people living in the here and now. So, like Jin, Auggie is also a perfect emblem of the pro-human position — and yet she lives out that position in a totally different way. She is not content to sacrifice people today for the mere chance at helping people tomorrow. But the most interesting character is Will, a humble science teacher who is given the chance to go into space and do humanity a major solid by gathering intel on the aliens. When the man in charge of the mission vets Will for the gig, he asks Will to sign a loyalty oath to humanity — to swear that he’ll never renege and side with the aliens. Will refuses. “They might end up being better than us,” he says. “Why would I swear loyalty to us if they could end up being better?” It’s a radical open-mindedness to the possibility that we humans might really suck — and that maybe we don’t deserve to be the protagonists of the universe’s story. If another species is better, kinder, more moral, should our allegiance be to furthering those values, or to the species we happen to be part of? The pro-humanist vision As we’ve seen, there are different ways to live out pro-humanism. In philosophy circles, there are names for these different approaches. While Auggie is a “neartermist,” focused on solving problems that affect people today, Jin is a classic “longtermist.” At its core, longtermism is the idea that we should care more about positively influencing the long-term future of humanity — hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years from now. The idea emerged out of effective altruism (EA), a broader social movement dedicated to wielding reason and evidence to do the most good possible for the most people. Longtermists often talk about existential risks. They care a lot about making sure, for example, that runaway AI doesn’t render Homo sapiens extinct. For the most part , Western society doesn’t assign much value to future generations , something we see in our struggles to deal with long-term threats like climate change. But because longtermists assign future people as much moral value as present people, and there are going to be way more people alive in the future than there are now, longtermists are especially focused on staving off risks that could erase the chance for those future people to exist. The poster boy for longtermism, Oxford philosopher and founding EA figure Will MacAskill, published a book on the worldview called What We Owe the Future . To him, avoiding extinction is almost a sacrosanct duty. He writes: With great rarity comes great responsibility. For thirteen billion years, the known universe was devoid of consciousness ... Now and in the coming centuries, we face threats that could kill us all. And if we mess this up, we mess it up forever. The universe’s self-understanding might be permanently lost ... the brief and slender flame of consciousness that flickered for a while would be extinguished forever. There are a few eyebrow-raising anthropocentric ideas here. How confident are we that the universe was or would be barren of highly intelligent life without humanity? “Highly intelligent” by whose lights — humanity’s? And are we so sure that the universe would be meaningless without human minds to experience it? But this way of thinking is popular among tech billionaires like Elon Musk , who talks about the need to colonize Mars as “life insurance” for the human species because we have “a duty to maintain the light of consciousness ” rather than going extinct. Musk describes MacAskill’s book as “a close match for my philosophy.” The transhumanist vision A close match — but not a perfect match. Musk has a lot of commonalities with the pro-human camp, including his view that we should make lots of babies in order to stave off civilizational collapse. But he’s arguably a bit closer to that strange combo of pro-humanism and anti-humanism that we know as “transhumanism.” Hence Musk’s company Neuralink , which recently implanted a brain chip in its first human subject. The ultimate goal, in Musk’s own words , is “to achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence.” He wants to develop a technology that helps humans “merg[e] with AI” so that we won’t be “left behind” as AI becomes more sophisticated. In 3 Body Problem , the closest parallel for this approach is the anti-humanist faction that wants to help the aliens, not out of a belief that humans are so terrible they should be totally destroyed, but out of a hope that humans just might be redeemable with an infusion of the right knowledge or technology. On the show, that technology comes via aliens; in our world, it’s perceived to be coming via AI. But regardless of the specifics, this is an approach that says: Let the overlords come. Don’t try to beat ’em — join ’em. It should come as no surprise that the anti-humanists in 3 Body Problem refer to the aliens as “Our Lord.” That makes total sense, given that they’re viewing the aliens as a supremely powerful force that exists outside themselves and can propel them to a higher form of consciousness. If that’s not God, what is? In fact, transhumanist thinking has a very long religious pedigree . In the early 1900s, French Jesuit priest and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin argued that we could use tech to nudge along human evolution and thereby bring about the kingdom of God; melding humans and machines would lead to “ a state of super-consciousness ” where we become a new enlightened species. Teilhard influenced his pal Julian Huxley, an evolutionary biologist who popularized the term “transhumanism” (and the brother of Brave New World author Aldous Huxley). That influenced the futurist Ray Kurzweil, who in turn shaped the thinking of Musk and many Silicon Valley tech heavyweights. Some people today have even formed explicitly religious movements around worshiping AI or using AI to move humanity toward godliness, from Martine Rothblatt’s Terasem movement to the Mormon Transhumanist Association to Anthony Levandowski’s short-lived Way of the Future church . “Our Lord,” indeed. Related Silicon Valley’s vision for AI? It’s religion, repackaged. The anti-humanist vision Hardcore anti-humanists go much farther than the transhumanists. In their view, there’s no reason to keep humanity alive. The philosopher Eric Dietrich, for example, argues that we should build “the better robots of our nature” — machines that can outperform us morally — and then hand over the world to what he calls “Homo sapiens 2.0.” Here is his modest proposal: Let’s build a race of robots that implement only what is beautiful about humanity, that do not feel any evolutionary tug to commit certain evils, and then let us — the humans — exit stage left, leaving behind a planet populated with robots that, while not perfect angels, will nevertheless be a vast improvement over us. Another philosopher, David Benatar, argued in his 2006 book Better Never to Have Been , that the universe would not be any less meaningful or valuable if humanity were to vanish. “The concern that humans will not exist at some future time is either a symptom of human arrogance … or is some misplaced sentimentalism,” he wrote. Whether or not you think we’re the only intelligent life in the universe is key here. If there are lots of civilizations out there, the stakes of humanity going extinct are much lower from a cosmic perspective. In 3 Body Problem , the characters know for a fact that there’s other intelligent life out there. This makes it harder for the pro-humanists to justify their position: on what grounds, other than basic survival instinct, can they really argue that it’s important for humanity to continue existing? Will might be the character with the most compelling response to this central question. When he refuses to sign the loyalty oath to humanity, he shows that he is neither dogmatically pro- humanist nor dogmatically anti-humanist. His loyalty is to certain values, like kindness. In the absence of certainty about who enacts those values best — humans or aliens — he remains species-agnostic. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","ChatGPT and its large language model (LLM) competitors that produce text on demand are very cool. So are the other fruits of the generative AI revolution: art generators , music generators , better automatic subtitles and translation . They can do a lot (including claim that they’re conscious , not that we should believe them), but there’s one important respect in which AI models are unlike people: They are processes that are run only when a human triggers them and only to accomplish a specific result. And then they stop. Now imagine that you took one of these programs — a really good chatbot, let’s say, but still just a chatbot — and you gave it the ability to write notes to itself, store a to-do list and the status of items on the to-do list, and delegate tasks to other copies of itself or other people. And instead of running only when a human prompted it, you had it work on an ongoing basis on these tasks — just like an actual human assistant. At that point, without any new leaps in technology whatsoever — just some basic tools glued onto a standard language model — you’d have what is called an “AI agent,” or an AI that acts with independent agency to pursue its goals in the world. AI agents have been called the “ future of artificial intelligence” that will “reinvent the way we live and work ,” the “ next frontier of AI.” OpenAI is reportedly working on developing such agents, as are many different well-funded startups . They may sound even more sci-fi than everything else you’ve already heard about AI, but AI agents are not nonsense, and if effective, could fundamentally change how we work. That said, they currently don’t work very well, and they pose obvious challenges for AI safety. Here’s a quick primer on where we’re (maybe) headed, and why. Why would you want one of these? Today’s AI chatbots are fun to talk to and useful assistants — if you are willing to overlook a set of limitations that includes making things up. Such models have already found sizable and important economic niches, from art to audio and video transcription (which have been quietly revolutionized over the last few years) to assisting programmers with tools like Copilot . But the investors pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into AI are hoping for something more transformative than that. Many people I talk to who use AI in their work describe it as like having a slightly scatterbrained but very fast intern. They do useful work, but you have to define each problem for them and carefully check their work, meaning that much of what you might gain in productivity is lost in oversight. Much of the economic case for AI is that it could do more than that. The people at work on AI agents hope that their tools won’t just help software developers, but that the tools could be software developers. In this future, you wouldn’t just consult AI for trip planning ideas ; instead, you could simply text it “plan a trip for me in Paris next summer,” as you might a really good executive assistant. Today’s AI agents do not live up to that dream — yet. The problem is that you need a very high accuracy rate on each step of a multistep process, or very good error correction, to get anything valuable out of an agent that has to take lots of steps. But there’s good reason to expect that future generation AI agents will be much better at what they do. First of all, the agents are built on increasingly powerful base models, which perform much better on a wide range of tasks, and which we can expect to continue to improve. Secondly, we’re also learning more about how to build agents themselves. A year ago, the first publicly available AI agents — AutoGPT, for example, which was just a very simple agent based on ChatGPT — were basically useless. But a few weeks ago, the startup Cognition Labs released Devin, an AI software engineer that can build and deploy entire small web applications . Devin is an impressive feat of engineering, and good enough to take some small gigs on Upwork and deliver working code. It had an almost 14 percent success rate on a benchmark that measures ability to resolve issues on the software developer platform GitHub . That’s a big leap forward for which there’s surely an economic niche — but at best, it’s a very junior software engineer who’d need close supervision by a more senior one. Still, like most things AI, we can expect improvement in the future. Should we make billions of AI agents? Would it be cool for everyone in the world to have an AI personal assistant who could plan dinner, order groceries, buy a birthday present for your mom, plan a trip to the zoo for the kids, and pay your bills for you while notifying you of any unexpected ones? Yes, absolutely. Would it be incredibly economically valuable to have AI software engineers who can do the work of human software engineers? Yes, absolutely. But: Is there something potentially worrying about creating agents that can reason and act independently, earn money independently, make copies of themselves independently, and do complex things without human oversight? Oh, definitely. For one, there are questions of liability. It’d be just as easy to make “scammer” AIs that spend their time convincing the elderly to send them money as it would to make useful agents. Who would be responsible if that happens? For another, as AI systems get more powerful, the moral quandaries they pose become more pressing. If Devin earns a lot of money as a software engineer, is there a sense that Devin, rather than the team that created him, is entitled to that money? What if Devin’s successors are created by a team that’s made up of hundreds of copies of Devin? And for those who worry about humanity losing control of our future if we build extremely powerful AI systems without thinking about the consequences ( I’m one of them ), it’s pretty obvious why the idea of AIs with agency is nerve-racking. The transition from systems that act only when users consult them to systems that go out and accomplish complex goals in the real world risks what leading AI scientist Yoshua Bengio calls “rogue AI”: “an autonomous AI system that could behave in ways that would be catastrophically harmful.” Think of it this way: It’s hard to imagine how ChatGPT could kill us, or could even be the kind of thing that would want to. It’s easy to imagine how a hyper-competent AI executive assistant/scam caller/software engineer could. For that reason, some researchers are trying to develop good tests of the capabilities of AI agents built off different language models, so that we’ll know in advance before we widely release ones that can make money, make copies of themselves, and function independently without oversight. Others are working to try to set good regulatory policy in advance, including liability rules that might discourage unleashing an army of super-competent scammer-bots. And while I hope that we have a few years to solve those technical and political challenges, I doubt we’ll have forever. The commercial incentives to make agent AIs are overwhelming, and they can genuinely be extremely useful. We just have to iron out their extraordinary implications — preferably before, rather than after, billions of them exist. A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

"1","W hen Pope Francis announced last July that he would create 21 new cardinals, longtime Vatican watcher John L. Allen Jr. immediately noted the significant number of “papabili” — possible papal candidates — on the list. Of these candidates, Allen noted Victor Manuel Fernández, the current head of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, whose star has presumably fallen since last summer given the fallout to Fiducia supplicans ; Claudio Gugerotti, whose role as the prefect of the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches gives him major input in dealings regarding the Russo-Ukrainian war; Christophe Pierre, the papal ambassador to the United States who follows Pope Francis’ style but with a greater degree of delicacy in controversial matters; and Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the patriarch of Jerusalem. Since the creation of those cardinals on Sept. 30, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 58, has become one of the most-discussed candidates to replace Pope Francis, 87. Much of this attention stems from world events. While Pizzaballa was in Rome following his elevation to cardinal, Hamas terrorists launched their murderous attack against Israeli civilians. In response, Pizzaballa rushed back to Jerusalem , where he has been serving since he arrived from his native Italy as a 25-year-old priest. Quickly upon his return, he offered himself in exchange for the child hostages. “I am ready for an exchange, anything, if this can lead to freedom, to bring the children home. No problem. There is total willingness on my part,” he said . His brave commitment garnered significant attention worldwide and gave inspiration to many Catholics. He later reflected to Catholic News Agency that the circumstances in Israel and Gaza had led him to contemplate the fact that cardinals wear red as a sign of martyrdom. “The cardinalate’s red color has taken on a profound significance marked by much sorrow, by many hardships,” he said . “Obviously, the Lord wants me here, he wants me to bring his grace to this place.” The cardinal has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas conflict since last October . Additionally, he has characterized Israel’s military response to the terrorist attacks as “ disproportionate .” His repeated calls for peace have drawn strong support from Rome, as Pope Francis has likewise issued adamant calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. The Vatican has continued throughout the duration of the conflict to elevate Pizzaballa’s peace-seeking efforts. Earlier this year, for example, the pope described Pizzaballa as “ a crucial figure .” Pizzaballa’s adamant calls for a ceasefire have met with some resistance. After the cardinal described the Israeli response as “disproportionate” last week in an event alongside Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, the Israeli ambassador to the Holy See called the use of the term “deplorable” before rephrasing and calling it “unfortunate.” In his Holy Thursday homily, Pizzaballa sought to explain his decision to controversially demand an end to all hostilities. He stated that he believes Christians, in response to difficult situations, should act “differently,” with “strength and courage.” Cardinal Pizzaballa seems to have the backing of the pope’s close allies given that Pope Francis has repeatedly elevated him throughout his papacy. Pope Francis appointed him bishop and apostolic administrator of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem in 2016, made him a member of the Congregation for Oriental Churches in 2017, and then elevated him to the role of Latin patriarch of Jerusalem in 2020. The support of the pope’s allies would be critical for election by a conclave given that 94 out of 129 cardinal electors were created by Pope Francis. Earlier this week, the National Catholic Register’s Edward Pentin described Pizzaballa’s rise to the status of “papabile” as “meteoric.” While Vatican watchers remain in a perpetual state of speculation regarding the potential candidates for pope — Pentin, for instance, published a book in 2020 on the leading candidates, many of whom are speculated to have already aged out of contention, and several of whom are too conservative to be actual candidates — the fact that Pope Francis is so old and Pizzaballa so young means that talk about Pizzaballa may be less useless. With the pope having reached the age of 87 and his age restricting him in recent years, there is naturally discussion about a potential retirement and how much longer he may live. Yet Pope Francis insists that he is in “good health” and has no intention of resigning. On March 15, he called the possibility of resigning “a distant possibility” since he “do[es] not have any cause serious enough to make [him] think of resigning.” According to Reuters, the pope appeared to be in better shape at his papal audience on Wednesday following a four-week span in which he had an aide deliver his remarks. The pope had been suffering from a “cold, bronchitis and influenza,” for the previous month, per the news service. Were Cardinal Pizzaballa to be elected pope, he would likely be a centrist. The Franciscan friar adopts Pope Francis’ style of humble pastoralism, maintains adherence to doctrine, does not step into controversial debates, and focuses on issues like world peace, helping the needy, and interreligious dialogue. However, he is likely not seeking out the papal office. When informed by a journalist of Pope Francis’ decision to appoint him a cardinal, Pizzaballa was reportedly confused and asked the journalist, “Who?” READ MORE: Vatican Scrambles to Clarify Same-Sex Blessings.

"1","Last Friday, a trove of evidence was released in the harrowing child abuse case against YouTuber Ruby Franke and her co-defendant, Jodi Hildebrandt. The evidence tells of egregious abuse against Franke’s two young children, who were 9 and 12 at the time the abuse occurred. Franke and Hildebrandt bound the young boy to the ground with tight ropes that left him with deep wounds. Franke tortured the boy by smothering him underwater, kicking him while wearing boots, and forcing him to work outside in the Utah summer without wearing shoes. The little girl, meanwhile, was forced to jump into a cactus several times, have her head shaved, and perform hours of manual labor outside in the heat. Both children were starved to the point of malnourishment and required multi-day stays in a hospital. The cruelty inflicted on the children shocks the conscience. The sentence the women can receive, 4 to 30 years , seems inadequate to many. As a result, Utah politicians have discussed reforming the state’s criminal justice system and child abuse laws. The case has drawn significant attention nationwide given that Franke ran a parenting YouTube channel that was followed by over 2 million people . On the channel, she shared her life raising her six children, including the two children she severely abused. Last month, Washington County Attorney Eric Clarke described the case as being “about religious extremism.” He explained , “The women appeared to fully believe that the abuse they inflicted was necessary to teach the children how to properly repent for imagined ‘sins’ and to cast the evil spirits out of their bodies.” The evidence released last week shows the extent to which the two abusers justified their actions on the basis of their religious radicalism. In numerous journal entries that were released last week, Franke justified the abuse of her two children with her belief that the two were possessed by demons or the devil. She stated in her journal that she withheld food and water from her son because “I will not feed a demon.” Franke also explained her belief that removing evil from a “possessed person” requires a long-term process. At another point, she justified the extreme physical labor she forced her children to perform on the basis of her desire to break their “bond” with Satan. Franke also recorded that she told her son, “I will not talk w/ a demon. Your soul is damned + I will not hear your damnable words,” and claimed that her son is “in and out of possession” and “worships the devil.” Her fanatical religious beliefs seemed to be an amalgamation of Mormonism, the religion she practiced, with other beliefs. For example, Franke used the Mormon belief that humans have a preexistence as spirits prior to being given a body to assert that, since her children were supposedly inherently evil, it only made sense that they were given bodies because they were given the oh-so-wonderful gift of her as a mother. “How [the two children] got to come + get a body can only be explained in me advocating to be their mother. This is not a conceited statement,” she asserted. Contrary to Mormonism’s belief that all people will receive “eternal glory,” however, Franke repeatedly told her children that they were damned and would burn in hell in endless torment. Franke exhibited an extreme form of moral rigorism that demanded strict ascetic practices in the name of religious devotion. For example, she demanded that her children “fast” for several days in a row. (Franke recorded in her journal that her daughter responded to this deprivation of food by writing a rhyme that said: “My mom starves me and calls it fasting. My mom won’t lift 2 fingers and bring me food because all she does is lie on the bed + eat brownies.”) Franke also seemed to believe in total depravity — the Calvinist idea that humans are entirely corrupted and are unable to choose against evil. She also embraced a dualistic worldview that regarded the body and the material world as intrinsically evil. Then there is her and Hildebrant’s obsession with the demonic. The Salt Lake Tribune spoke to a religious historian, John-Charles Duffy, who asserted that Franke and Hildebrant’s interpretation of demonic possession strays from mainstream Mormon beliefs. “Her notion of demonic possession … almost sounds more Pentecostal,” he said. “There is, of course, the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] tradition that there are evil spirits around who tempt us. But this goes beyond that. She thinks she’s talking to demons herself.” Prior to horrifically abusing two young children with the justification that the children were possessed, both Hildebrant and Franke believed that Hildebrant herself was possessed by demons. In an interview with Utah police, Franke’s husband, Kevin Franke, explained the strange spiritual claims put forward by Hildebrant. He said that Hildebrant had opened up to some friends about how “she believed she was being tormented and haunted by shadow figures every night.” As a result, Hildebrant went to live with a family to get help, he said. Kevin explained that the couple kicked Hildebrant out after she spent six weeks “stabbing herself with forks and knives, cutting herself, and wanting to commit suicide, and trying to seduce the husband of the family.” After Hildebrant got kicked out of that family’s home, Kevin explained, Ruby convinced him to allow Hildebrant to move in with them. He asserted that, as soon as Hildebrant moved into their house, strange phenomena began happening. “The moment she showed up in my house,” he said, “just the weirdest crap started happening: lights turning on and off, sounds of people walking in walls, sounds of footprints going up walls and across the ceiling, and stuff floating around. It was weird.” He told police: “I’m a smart guy. I’m an engineer. I’ve designed and helped build some really big stuff. I’ve been a college professor. I can’t explain some of the stuff that happened.” He described watching “plates in the kitchen just flying off by themselves, like full-speed smashing on the wall.” A Mormon bishop had been going over to Hildebrant’s house and saying he was “casting out demons,” Kevin Franke said. After she moved in with the Frankes, Kevin Franke said, he himself “became the resident exorcist.” He explained: “It was my job to go and give her blessings whenever she started to go into a trance and go into possession.” Eventually, he said, these “possessions” became as frequent as every hour at night, at which point Ruby started sharing a bed with Hildebrant. Kevin Franke said that, during these “possessions,” Hildebrant would say things in a weird voice such as: “She’s ours. We’re not letting go. She is Satan’s bride. She’s mine. I am going to marry her.” He said that Hildebrant and Franke, alongside another female friend, began gathering for spiritual sessions. Ruby would write down Hildebrant’s “visions and trances,” he said, and they believed that God would eventually “decree them to be written as scripture for the whole world to read.” These visions were very often satanic, he said. Eventually, Hildebrant convinced Ruby Franke to separate from her husband, move in with her, and spend her days abusing her children in what the prosecutor described as a “concentration camp-like setting.” Kevin Franke says he went along with the separation and did not see any of his children for more than a year before Hildebrant and his wife were arrested for child abuse. Hildebrant and Franke used possession and exorcism to cloak their heinous abuse in religious righteousness. With this new evidence, which reveals the depths of their fanaticism, it is clear that their unchecked extremism enabled the abuse. Those who witnessed the signs of escalating fanaticism and failed to intervene bear a share of the responsibility. READ MORE from Ellie Gardey: Californians Are Pushing for a ‘Two-Spirit’ Holiday.

"2","Joe Biden is swimming in cash, but short on voters’ support. The president has narrowed Donald Trump’s polling advantage in recent weeks but still trails his Republican rival both nationally and in the Rust Belt’s pivotal battlegrounds , according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. Biden’s approval rating, meanwhile, remains at a dismal 39 percent . But the president’s fundraising data tells a sunnier story. Biden and his party began March with $155 million at their disposal, more than three times the $50 million that Trump and the GOP had cobbled together. Biden grew this cash advantage Thursday. At a fundraiser in New York City, the president appeared with Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Mindy Kaling, and Queen Latifah — and collected at least $25 million from wealthy, celebrity-obsessed Democratic donors in the process. No one has ever raised more money from a single political event, according to the Biden campaign. Of course, in modern American politics, parties and presidential candidates aren’t the only major political spenders. Trump-aligned super PACs have around $52 million on hand, according to the latest Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings. But Biden- aligned super PACs have $64 million, and Democratic groups (including major unions ) have collectively pledged $900 million to the president’s reelection. For anxious Democrats, all this raises a question: How many votes can a cash advantage buy? Put differently, does Biden’s fundraising supremacy mean that today’s polls are probably underestimating his eventual support? After all, between now and November, nearly $1 billion worth of pro-Biden content is poised to inundate the airwaves. The answer to these questions will depend on two considerations: Whether Biden can maintain his current cash advantage, and how much influence TV ads can exert over voters’ perceptions of the race. It’s impossible to know either of these things with certainty. It appears likely, however, that Biden’s team will outspend Trump’s, and that this will improve the president’s standing, if only by a tiny margin. Trump’s legal troubles could keep his campaign cash-poor It’s far from certain that the president will retain his current fundraising advantage through the end of the campaign. At this point in the 2020 cycle, Trump had outraised Biden by $187 million , only to see the Democrat outspend him by November. Trump enjoys the goodwill of myriad billionaires; one of his upcoming fundraisers is expected to feature Wall Street tycoon Robert Mercer and fossil fuel magnate Harold Hamm. In theory, a super-rich individual could erase Biden’s financial edge by cutting a single check to a dark money group. This said, it seems likely that the Biden campaign will remain more flush than its rival through Election Day. Small-dollar donations reportedly account for roughly 97 percent of all contributions to the president’s reelection effort. This means that Biden can keep returning to his existing donors many times before they exceed the FEC’s $3,300 cap on individual campaign contributions. Further, as the Democratic Party has claimed a growing share of upper middle-class voters in the Trump era, it has outraised the GOP in both of the last two presidential cycles. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s financial difficulties are a drain on his campaign’s coffers. The mogul’s personal legal expenses consumed at least $50 million of his super PAC’s funds. And Trump’s legal bills will only mount in the months ahead, as his criminal trials near. Even without these attorneys fees, Trump would be pressed for cash. Earlier this month, he was forced to post a $91.6 million bond after a civil court found him liable for the sexual abuse and defamation of the writer E. Jean Carroll. Soon, he will need to put up a $175 million bond to cover a civil fraud judgment against him in New York state. Trump stands to make a windfall from his social media company , Truth Social, going public. But he cannot sell his shares in that firm for six months . All this means that pro-Trump groups are likely to divert a substantial portion of their funds away from ads or field operations and toward the candidate’s lawyers over the coming months. This reality, in turn, is making it more difficult for Trump to raise money. Many conservative donors are reluctant to give to Trump, since they fear their contributions will go toward defraying a billionaire’s legal expenses, rather than advancing right-wing policy, according to both Bloomberg and the New York Times . The case for thinking that money can buy Biden love (from an electorally significant fraction of the electorate) Biden is on track to outspend Trump this fall — whether he can buy himself a significantly higher share of the vote is another question. The case for thinking that Biden’s financial edge could be decisive is straightforward. The most up-to-date political science research indicates that television ads are capable of changing the voting intentions of a tiny — but potentially decisive — fraction of the electorate. A 2021 paper from the political scientists John Sides, Lynn Vavreck, and Christopher Warshaw offers a comprehensive look at how TV ads influenced US voting behavior from 2000 through 2018. In the study, the researchers tallied up the total number of Democratic and Republican ads that aired during the final two months of each election in a given media market. Then, they compared election outcomes in areas where Democrats aired more ads than Republicans did to outcomes in counties that border those areas — but which fell outside of a designated media market, and were therefore exposed to fewer political commercials. By exploiting these arbitrary media market borders, the researchers were able to estimate the electoral impact of a Democratic ad-advantage. Specifically, they found that, based on historical precedents, a Democratic presidential candidate who aired 100 more ads than their Republican adversary in a given market would expect to see their vote-share increase by 0.018 percentage points in that area. That’s a minuscule margin. But campaigns with large financial advantages can air hundreds — or even thousands — more ads in some places than their rivals. Sides, Vavreck, and Warshaw estimated that the “upper bound” on what percentage of the vote a Democratic presidential campaign can realistically gain through dominating the airwaves is 0.5 percentage points. That is small but potentially decisive; had Hillary Clinton increased her share of Michigan’s vote by 0.5 points in 2016, she would have won the state. Critically, the political scientists found that — contrary to a common assumption — there is seemingly no point at which airing more advertisements stops gaining your campaign more votes. Even when the airwaves are already inundated, failing to keep pace with your rival’s ad spending comes at a cost to your support. These findings are all based on the outcomes of presidential elections held before 2017. And there’s some reason to think that TV ads may actually have become more effective at persuading voters since then. This is because not all political ads are created equal. Some resonate with voters while others can actually backfire. Campaigns have grown more aware of this fact in just the past few years, and have ramped up efforts to test the efficacy of ads before broadcasting them. A 2024 study of campaign ad-testing illuminates this reality. Researchers gained access to an archive of 146 advertising experiments conducted by Democratic campaigns in 2018 and 2020 over the platform Swayable. Analyzing the outcomes of these tests, the study’s authors reached two main findings: First, some ads were much more effective than others. And second, there were no consistent patterns to which appeals performed best. The latter point is important. Historically, campaigns have often relied on broad theories of political persuasion to inform their ad strategies. But the Swayable ad tests indicate that such general rules might be unreliable. Researchers gauged the efficacy of negative ads versus positive ones, emotional appeals versus fact-heavy spots, and testimonials from supporters versus statements from the candidate. Their conclusion on which work better can be summarized in two words: It depends. Some ad strategies that worked for Democratic House candidates in 2018 were no longer effective in 2020. The specific context of each election year and race appeared to change what voters did and did not find compelling. This suggests that, until recently, campaigns may have been routinely airing ineffective commercials on the basis of flawed political theories. In just the last couple election cycles, however, Democrats have dramatically increased their use of ad testing. In 2018, Democrats tested ads for only six of the 30 “toss-up” US House races over Swayable; in 2022, the party tested ads for 20 of the 36 “toss-up” contests. Notably, in the latter year, Democratic candidates performed much better in highly contested races (where the party aired lots of TV ads) than in other races (where it aired relatively few). Ad testing is very expensive. Not only do you need to hire consultancies that can assemble statistically significant survey pools, but you also need to pay to fully produce many ads that you don’t end up airing. And yet, according to the 2024 study, ads vary so much in their efficacy that campaigns would benefit from dedicating at least 10 percent of their media budgets to testing. For these reasons, ad-testing may “compound money’s influence in elections,” according to the study’s authors. After all, better-funded campaigns can not only air more ads than their opponents but also more effective ads, since they’ll be capable of paying for more thorough ad experiments. Put all this together, and you end up with a case for thinking that Biden’s fundraising advantage could increase his vote-share in close swing-states by a decisive margin. Why money might matter less in 2024 All this said, there’s also a plausible case for thinking that ads will be less effective in 2024 than in a typical election. One of the central findings of Sides, Vavreck, and Warshaw’s study is that ads are much more effective in down-ballot races than in presidential ones. While ad dominance could only gain Democrats 0.5 percentage points of vote-share at the presidential level, according to the paper, that figure was 1.6 points in attorney general races, 1.5 points in state treasurer races, 1.35 points in gubernatorial races, 1 point in Senate races, and 0.9 points in House races. The theoretical explanation for this discrepancy is simple: Ads are most effective when voters lack strong, preexisting opinions about the candidates. The typical independent voter knows how they feel about Joe Biden, but probably couldn’t tell you a thing about the Democratic candidate for their district’s state Senate seat. An advertisement is therefore more likely to change their mind about who to support in a state Senate race than in a presidential one. This is an unfavorable dynamic for Biden. If ads are less effective when the candidates are already well-known, then one would expect an ad advantage to be worth much less in 2024 than in the average presidential election. After all, we’re looking at a rematch between one of the most widely discussed politicians on the planet and a man who has been working in the White House for 12 of the last 16 years. “We’re in an election where people know a lot about each candidate,” Michigan State University political scientist Matt Grossmann told me. “So I think if you had to guess in advance, you would say that ads would be less effective this year than they were in the past.” The 2016 election also featured a race between two candidates who’d spent decades in the public eye. That year, Hillary Clinton greatly outspent Donald Trump on the airwaves, which, of course, wasn’t enough to save her campaign. All this suggests that Biden’s fundraising prowess should gain him a little bit of support. But well-funded ad campaigns (almost certainly) won’t be enough to erase the president’s polling deficit. Combine a cash advantage with an improving economy and increasingly unpopular GOP agenda, however, and Mindy Kaling’s investment in the president just might pay off.

"2","Former President Donald Trump’s net worth has skyrocketed to about $7.5 billion since Trump Media, the parent company for his social network Truth Social, went public earlier this week. The question for Trump’s presidential bid — and his various legal troubles — is whether he can actually cash in on those gains. His 2024 campaign and the Save America political action committee supporting it have posted dismal fundraising numbers in recent months. Trump is also facing a fast-approaching deadline to post a $175 million civil fraud bond in the New York case involving his inflation of the value of his real estate holdings. Trump Media’s initial public offering could theoretically help solve these problems: Trump’s stake in the company is worth about $4.8 billion at its current stock price, according to Barron’s. Traded under the ticker symbol “DJT,” the company’s stock price surged to $77.27 on Tuesday, coming down to a still impressive $61.96 by the time markets closed Thursday. Its price is well above that of Reddit, a nearly 20-year-old social media company that had a much larger user base (hundreds of millions of monthly active users vs a paltry one million for Truth Social) and more sophisticated revenue model when its stock went public last week. Whether that windfall proves to be Trump’s saving grace, however, depends on how long the good times keep rolling for DJT — and if Trump can sell his shares without triggering a downward spiral. Trump’s financial troubles, explained Trump may now be one of the world’s 500 richest people, as Bloomberg declared after Trump Media started trading. But that doesn’t necessarily mean he has a lot of cash to spare. In February, his official campaign fund and the Save America PAC raised a total of $15.9 million and ended the month with over $37 million on hand. That’s far behind President Joe Biden’s campaign, which raised $26 million on Thursday night alone at an event in New York with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton — a record for a single political event. Trump has now resorted to selling special edition Bibles as a fundraising tactic. Never one to be outdone, he is also aiming to surpass the record set by Biden at a April 6 fundraising event in Palm Beach, where he’s targeting a $33 million goal. He’s also gotten some relief. Trump no longer has to pay the $464 million bond previously ordered in the New York civil fraud case against him, which his lawyers revealed he would not be able to post after being rejected by 30 insurance companies. On March 25, the judge in the case reduced the bond amount to $175 million and gave him a 10-day extension to post it. Trump has said he will do so . Otherwise, the state could seize some of his New York properties. But paying the bond will leave him short on cash, which may be why he is looking to TruthSocial for a windfall. Why TruthSocial might not be a cash cow Since the IPO, Trump Media stock has been experiencing the high volatility that is characteristic of meme stocks, a kind of social media- driven financial speculation that was made famous by Gamestop . But Trump Media stock is different from other meme stocks in an important way: its value is divorced from its business results, said John Rekenthaler in an analysis for Morningstar, where he is vice president of research. “As with bitcoin , people buy Trump Media not for future cash flows but because: 1) they expect its price to rise, and 2) they feel an affiliation for the asset,” Rekenthaler said. For shareholders, it’s a way “they can express their beliefs and commitment.” That’s a good thing for Trump, given that TruthSocial’s business results are in the gutter. The company reported $49 million in net losses in the first nine months of 2023, and it relies on a doubtful business model. Users don’t seem to want to pay for memberships and TruthSocial therefore has to rely on advertising. But the platform purports to be a free speech haven, and that can scare away advertisers who don’t want their brand appearing alongside controversial or illicit content. The lack of financial viability didn’t matter as much before Trump Media went public; TruthSocial still served its purpose by giving Trump a platform and encouraging rank-and-file conservatives to abandon other social media. But now profitability is a much more urgent question — not only for the DJT stock price but for Trump’s ability to take advantage of the windfall he has enjoyed on paper. Post-IPO, major Trump Media shareholders — including Trump — won’t be able to sell their stock for a period of six months. Such “lock-up” periods are designed to help companies get their footing after going public. If Trump tries to circumvent the lock-up, other shareholders could sue by arguing that his selling off stock triggered a decline in the stock price, causing them to sustain losses. But with the deadline to post bond nearing, Trump may need the money before the lock-up period ends. And by the time the six-month window is up, the price of those shares may have come back down. Tom Hulick, CEO of Strategy Asset Managers, a private advisory firm, told Barron’s that DJT “doesn’t meet the characteristics of a high quality” stock that would sustain its current value over the long term. It’s also not clear if he could actually sell without tanking the stock. He would need to find willing buyers, and even if he does, dumping all of his shares at once could tank the stock price, therefore devaluing them. Nevertheless, Trump has often defied conventional wisdom, and by extension, so could TruthSocial. This is a social media network owned by an ex-president with an ardent base of supporters who is currently ahead in the runup to the 2024 election according to the polls. “Predicting DJT’s fortune is like predicting the direction of bitcoin,” Rekenthaler said . “Others may try, but not me.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","T hose who get rich off of turning young Americans into addicted losers who contribute nothing to society have met a roadblock: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. On Thursday, Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have legalized the sale of marijuana in the state of Virginia. His explanation for the veto summarizes well the negative consequences faced by other states that have legalized marijuana: “States following this path,” he said , “have seen adverse effects on children’s and adolescents’ health and safety, increased gang activity and violent crime, significant deterioration in mental health, decreased road safety, and significant costs associated with retail marijuana that far exceed tax revenue.” Youngkin’s recognition of the obvious — that marijuana legalization is demonstrably bad for society — is sorely needed at this time when the marijuana industry deploys endless lobbyists and PR campaigns to claim that legalization has a net benefit. Spoiler alert: it doesn’t. Marijuana’s harmfulness starts with just that: it is inherently harmful. According to the Yale School of Medicine, 30 percent of marijuana users have cannabis use disorder , i.e., they are addicted to the drug. Another study published in the International Journal of Drug Policy has found that 44.7 percent of people who have smoked marijuana have gone on to use other illegal drugs. (And yes, marijuana is still illegal under federal law, as it is classified as a Schedule I drug.) According to the Department of Health and Human Service’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, marijuana use is linked to “depression, anxiety, suicide planning, and psychotic episodes,” and people who use marijuana are more likely to have “relationship problems, worse educational outcomes, lower career achievement, and reduced life satisfaction.” Marijuana is also not helpful as a medical treatment. Cannabis has never been shown to be beneficial for the ailments it is often used to treat: pain, depression, and anxiety. Glenn Youngkin rightly drew attention to the negative consequences states that have legalized marijuana have experienced. These consequences are well-documented. According to the Journal of Criminal Justice , recreational marijuana legalization has increased property and violent crime in Oregon. In addition, Colorado’s Department of Public Safety noted in 2021 that, since legalization, the state had seen an increase in “marijuana-related hospitalizations, Emergency Room visits, poison control calls, DUIs, and fatal crashes where drivers tested positive for cannabinoids.” There is also the fact that legalization of marijuana increases usage of the drug among minors, who are particularly negatively affected by the drug. In fact, people who use marijuana as adolescents can experience a permanent loss of up to eight IQ points . They are also at risk for developing psychosis and schizophrenia. Marijuana lobbyists have long claimed that legalization will create a cash cow of revenue for states. There has been doubt cast on this claim, however. A study published in the National Tax Journal concluded that cannabis revenues “cannibalize” other tax revenues since legalizing cannabis results in a 15 percent decrease in sales of alcohol and a 5 percent decrease in the sale of cigarettes. In addition, there are the numerous other costs states must take on when they let people run wild with a dangerous and extremely addictive drug, including increased policing costs. States have also been surprised by the low amount of revenue generated by cannabis sales. For example, California has had to make changes to its budgets after expected tax revenues from cannabis have been well below expectations . Glenn Youngkin is one of the few governors to see the light in a country full of state politicians working to legalize marijuana or who have already done so. Much of the responsibility for this movement lies with another governor, California Gov. Gavin Newsom. When Newsom was lieutenant governor of California, he was one of the first politicians to come out in favor of marijuana legalization. From there, he spearheaded a committee whose purpose was to demonstrate that marijuana legalization could be implemented in a way that minimizes any potential harms for society. That committee was influential in convincing other states that marijuana legalization could be safely adopted at a time when it was becoming clear that many harmful consequences were resulting from legalization. Youngkin says he never even considered signing the bill to legalize pot. When he was asked last week whether he would do so, he responded : “Anybody who thinks I’m going to sign that legislation must’ve been smoking something.” Bravo, Glenn Youngkin.

"1","Without the Resurrection, said the Apostle Paul, our faith is in vain. Easter, of course, celebrates the Resurrection of Christ. Other than the birth of Christ commemorated at Christmas, no other day is as sacred to Christians as Easter Sunday. Each year, the Christian faithful mark this crucial event by going to church. Some honor the full Easter Triduum of Holy Thursday and Good Friday and Easter Sunday. Many further contemplate the sacred occasion by watching films that help absorb the fullness of Christ’s Passion. I know many who watch Mel Gibson’s magnum opus, The Passion of the Christ , a cinematic masterpiece. (The crude Frank Rich of the New York Times compared it to gay porn .) Another timeless work is Franco Zeffirelli’s 1977 epic, Jesus of Nazareth . More recently, I particularly enjoyed the 2016 film, Risen . (READ MORE from Paul Kengor: Gutting Jesus: Feminist Cabrini , Secular Saint ) In that spirit, I can now recommend a new film. It’s a fresh, fascinating documentary on the Shroud of Turin, titled, The Shroud: Face to Face , written, directed, and produced by Robert Orlando. As some readers here know, Orlando and I together did the 2019 film on Pope John Paul II and Ronald Reagan, The Divine Plan (full disclosure). That was an historical work, whereas this work by Orlando is personal as well as historical. It’s an intimate journey taken by Orlando himself, connected to his father’s death. He places himself in the narrative and takes viewers along his investigative search into the authenticity of the Shroud. Of course, the roots of the Shroud are Biblical as well as historical. Christ was wrapped in a burial cloth when placed in his tomb. When Mary Magdalene and the women reached the tomb first, followed by John and Peter, they were shocked to find it empty, with only the linens that covered Jesus remaining behind. Scripture itself conveys the linens’ significance. In the Gospel of John, it says that John, who got to the tomb ahead of Peter, “went in, and he saw and he believed.” (John 20:8-10) One wonders if John saw something in the cloth that made him believe. Yes, he saw that the tomb was empty, but so had Mary Magdalene, who wondered who had taken away her Lord’s body. What did John see in the cloth (perhaps) that made him believe? In essence, the burial cloth left behind, which Jesus passed through before passing through the stone covering the tomb, served as the first evidence of the resurrected body. Yes, think about that. That cloth held something most special. What happened to it thereafter? Where is it today? Seekers for centuries have searched for the Holy Grail, or for remnants of the Cross itself. But what of the burial cloth? What about the famed Shroud of Turin (click here and here for official websites) that many believe is the actual surviving cloth? Orlando’s documentary calls it flatly: “The most investigated relic in the history of humankind: the Shroud of Turin. They say it holds the image of Jesus Christ, imprinted on his burial cloth.” As one of the experts interviewed by Orlando observes, “The Shroud could be a piece of physical evidence for the resurrection itself.” (READ MORE: Cabrini : It Gets Worse ) What’s especially striking about this particular image of Jesus is that it’s one that isn’t painted. It was produced by what Shroud experts believe had to have been some form of enormous energy that burst through it. Says Orlando: “Intense radiation of light is the key…. Extreme radiation of light is the catalyst for the image on the Shroud as well as the Resurrection.” Advocates believe that this relic was imbued with energy from a divine source. One expert interviewed by Orlando, the brilliant Fr. Robert Spitzer , a priest and theologian specializing in the intersection of faith and reason, gives a detailed scientific explication. Quoting a July-August 2010 study published in the Journal of Imaging Science and Technology , Spitzer says that the ultraviolet light necessary to form the Shroud image “exceeds the maximum power released by all ultraviolet light sources available today.” According to the authors of the study, this would require “pulses having durations shorter than one forty-billionth of a second, and intensities on the order of several [6-8] billion watts.” A single laser alone could not explain the image over the full length of the body. “In fact,” states Spitzer, “it would have taken 14,000 lasers like the one used by [the scientists in the study] to produce a full body image like the one on the Shroud.” Moreover, added Spitzer: “That’s radiation [emanating] from a dead body. That never happens.” Indeed. And an enormous amount of energy to boot. The mystery of the Shroud of Turin has intrigued Protestants and Catholics alike. It’s noteworthy that Orlando’s film includes more Protestant experts than Catholics. That’s important to know, because many evangelicals disregard the Shroud of Turin as just some “relic” that only interests Catholics. That is plainly not the case. In fact, though Orlando’s film is getting rave reviews from Catholics and endorsements from the likes of Bishop Robert Barron (click here and here ), it’s quite telling that the biggest screening so far was at the Museum of the Bible . Orlando spent hours with leading Protestant theologians who have done deep dives into the Shroud. His interviewees included renowned apologist Dr. Gary Habermas, Dr. Dale C. Allison Jr. of Princeton Theological Seminary, Dr. Craig Evans of Houston Theological Seminary, Dr. Ben Witherington III of Asbury Theological Seminary, and more. Witherington refers to the Shroud of Turin as “a photographic negative of a dead person” at a time when no such thing was technologically possible — i.e., when you couldn’t take pictures. In fact, it wasn’t until French and Italian photographers took pictures of the image in the 19 th century and early 20 th centuries that they realized what they were gazing upon. They now had themselves a photographic negative of a negative, in turn generating a positive image. Said Dr. Witherington: “Look at this image of a real person. The negative is the positive and the positive is the negative. How in the world did that happen? … What happened is that there was some light burst that imprinted his [Jesus’] image on the Shroud.” These 19 th -20 th century photos of the cloth image allowed observers at last, many centuries later, to see more fully what one cannot see with the naked eye. And what did they see? As Shroud expert Dr. Mark Goodacre told Orlando, they encountered the “one relic of Jesus that stands out from all the others [relics].” They encountered not a Medieval painting but an actual image that uncannily bears all the unique signs of the crucified Jesus: The nails, bleeding feet and hands, crown of thorns, the shoulder wound, and more. As Goodacre notes, there were many people crucified in Jesus’ time, but most certainly not everyone crucified had a spear thrust into his side and was wearing a crown of thorns pressed into his skull. The Shroud markings fully align with the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion, death, burial, and even resurrection (radiation through the linen clothes) of Christ. Those who know about the debate over the Shroud will point to disputed questions over when it first emerged, which is commonly believed to be around the 13 th century — i.e., over a thousand years after Christ’s burial. Orlando’s documentary, however, starts in the first century and then reports that the Shroud had been locked up and protected for hundreds of years before reemerging around the year 525. The Knights Templar allegedly got involved in bringing the Shroud from the Middle East to Europe, before it ultimately ended up in Turin, Italy — a long journey from Jerusalem. (READ MORE: It’s a Wonderful Film — Yes, the Best Ever ) Among the film’s beautiful visuals, Orlando takes the viewer to Turin (and to Rome). He is accompanied by Fr. Andrew Dalton, a young Catholic priest who, along with Orlando, is one of the main characters in the film. Dalton’s knowledge of the Shroud is second to none. His words and arguments are very convincing. Dalton is especially compelling when dealing with the biggest objection to the Shroud, namely, the major carbon-14 dating investigation in the 1980s that led to assertions that the Shroud was not authentic. Those results claimed that the Shroud dates from the 13 th -14 th centuries, roughly the years 1260-1390. This film skillfully dissects the flaws in that investigation, most notably that the 1980s scientists pulled samples from the outer perimeter of the cloth that might have been sewn into the fabric by nuns who tried to repair damage to it after a church fire in the 13 th century. That isn’t the only flaw. I cannot do justice to the debate here. You’ll have to watch for yourself. And really, that’s my main takeaway and advice to anyone reading this with interest. Watch the film yourself and come to your own conclusions. You may be struck to see that Orlando himself doesn’t wrap up (no pun intended) his Shroud presentation with a hard judgment for or against, though he clearly is more pro-Shroud. The website for the film is https://www.theshroudfilm.com . It debuts this Easter weekend. This film really is a must-see at Easter. Imagine: Christ may well have left behind physical evidence of his resurrected body — the very material that his body passed through as he rose again. Think about that. Is that worth considering for an hour and 10 minutes of your time this Easter weekend? Yeah, I’d think so."
"1","Previously underappreciated ancient liturgies are making a comeback. One such liturgy? Tenebrae. In the Diocese of Columbus, home to 280,000 Catholics , some 14 parishes (including St. Joseph Cathedral) will celebrate some version of Tenebrae this year. I can remember a time not so long ago when it was impossible to find a church that was willing to do it — and for good reason. It is not an easy liturgy to add to a week already packed with special liturgies, each with its own rubric and unique music. (READ MORE: Holy Land Christians Celebrate Easter Amid War ) Tenebrae (meaning “darkness” in Latin) is a combination of Matins and Lauds — the sections of the Divine Office prayed by the clergy on behalf of the faithful during the earliest hours of the morning. During the Triduum , the three days leading up to Easter, the Catholic Church has traditionally urged the clergy to anticipate the offices the previous night (Holy Thursday’s Tenebrae is said Wednesday night; Good Friday’s is said Thursday night, etc.), ostensibly to let the clergy get a bit more sleep in between liturgies. That, of course, doesn’t make Tenebrae easy. Each liturgy is composed of 14 psalms, nine of the most difficult chant responsories ever sung, and nine lessons (readings from Scripture, the Church Fathers , and the epistles), all of which combined take about two hours to sing — and that’s assuming the choir doesn’t decide to replace some of those responsories with polyphony. According to tradition, the liturgy is sung in a dimly lit church facing a massive candelabra (called a “hearse”) with 15 lit candles — one for each of the psalms, and one representing Christ. Over the course of the two hours, each candle is extinguished. (READ MORE: Go Touch Some Grass ) Those who attend Tenebrae mark this as the most beautiful part about the liturgy. There’s something about watching as, slowly, each flame goes out, one by one. The congregation experiences a sense of both anticipation and abandonment. With the last candle representing Christ, we watch and participate in the symbol of our renunciation of him and are stuck by the loneliness of God in the Passion. The psalmist sings, “Thou has put away my acquaintance far from me: they have set me an abomination to themselves.” Christ’s apostles have abandoned and denied Him. On the cross, He cries out, “My God, My God, why has thou abandoned me?” (READ MORE from Aubrey Gulick: In the Spirit of Penance: Lenten Music to Lift Your Spirit ) God suffers for us, alone. In Tenebrae, after the last psalm is sung, the last candle is removed and taken behind the altar to represent Christ’s burial. The celebrant slams his book shut, and the faithful bang on the pews to represent the earthquake that took place after Christ’s death. The noise subsides when the candle returns. It is then snuffed out, and the liturgy abruptly ends. There is a reason why Catholics have begun to return to Tenebrae. In a modern world where we’re constantly besieged by depressing news, where rates of suicide are reaching record highs, and where loneliness has reached epidemic levels , our faith offers us hope — but first, it reminds us that God also walked in this valley of death."
"1","W hat would you think about a Washington insider who was a partner in a big D.C. lobbyist law firm called Covington & Burling, the founder of a self- identified “nonpartisan” advocacy group called Common Good , and was a self- described “radical centrist,” whose main goal was to reform government administration to make it more effective? Your first impression would probably be wrong. This important author and activist has been moving right over the years and has won awards from conservative organizations. With his most recent book Everyday Freedom , Philip K. Howard has not only fully arrived on the Right, but in a few pages, he has put it all together in a book everyone can understand, learn from, and enjoy. (READ MORE: No One Is Safe: Payday Lenders’ Shady Practices Make Identity Theft Easy ) Writing from an unambiguously conservative perspective, he says: “I now see that the greater danger is not ineffective government but the corrosion of American culture.” The real problem is that big government bureaucracy has made it so that people “no longer have the freedom to take responsibility in their daily choices.” At this stage of bureaucratism, Howard now argues, average Americans’ “everyday freedom” requires “not so much reform but a complete change in direction.” Thousand-Page Rule Books Drown Everyday Freedom Howard bases much of his thinking about this loss of freedom for everyday citizens on the ideas of Nobel Laureate F.A. Hayek, Alexis de Tocqueville’s observations of American culture and community, and philosopher Michael Polanyi’s methodology. It is what Ronald Reagan called a fusionist synthesis (not Howard’s term) representing the ideals that made Western civilization work. Howard finds that progressivism abandoned free markets early in favor of centralized government power and expertise to advance a welfare state, but it was not fully realized until the 1960s. Then, in the name of civil rights, “with the best of intentions,” its supporters created a legal system full of red tape and processes that “made people squirm through the eye of a legal needle” to achieve its goals. That system became so pervasive and complex that the average citizen lost any sense of traditional order and individual responsibility. As Tocqueville had feared, centralized bureaucratic government tends to reach into all the “minor things of life,” which does not promote resistance but wears down on the mind’s unconscious self until, as Tocqueville predicted , “they are led to surrender the exercise of their own will.” The only option allowed is to follow the new administrative state into a legal and social order with no “wiggle room for bias, unfairness or error.” (READ MORE: The Best Kind of Hippie: A Classy One ) As a lawyer, Howard is especially knowledgeable about the change in legal mechanisms since the 1960s “rights revolution,” when government and society required one to prove innocence rather than being adjudged “not guilty.” As a result: 1) Law changed from general prescriptions to “one correct way” buried in thousand-page rule books on how to do pretty much everything; 2) Legal process rules were required to prove everything beforehand, to answer every possible question before taking action with resulting real-world delay for years to get it all correct; and 3) this impossibility of considering all beforehand encouraged lawsuits after the fact when some aspect of the plan aggrieved someone’s sense of their own liberty sued for neglecting some perhaps minor procedural aspect of the law. Howard agrees with Hayek that real liberty is impossible without law, rights are subsequent to law, and, as a result, some level of government legal power is required for freedom. The failure of post-60s law is that it “puts tight legal controls on daily choices to prevent people with responsibility from making bad choices.” It proscribes one correct way to do things. But there is rarely one correct way and forcing authorities to adhere to one regardless of whether it fits is a main reason why the present system does not work. Quoting John Locke, Howard notes that “the end of law is not to restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom.” The rule of law must provide a standard that reduces social destruction enough to allow free trading and social order. Even today’s letter of the law is “too detailed, too cold and formal.” Good law should only forbid “unreasonable acts,” should only set broad principles not detailed rules, and have clear lines of authority to interpret and enforce them. Authorities need the power to act under these rules, even judges — of whom Howard thinks of perhaps too highly — should not be held to narrow rule- following. Other officials do need enough power to solve problems like the recent Philadelphia interstate highway, which was repaired in record time using common sense and suspending many bureaucratic rules. He concludes that public trust can be restored only if public and private institutions are allowed to act reasonably. Redo the Rule Books The level of government matters. The Constitution provides national government limited power and institutions for specific responsibilities. Over the years, national power has grown well beyond what the Founders envisioned. Howard says one major result is that the “outsourcing of social services to distant government bureaucracies” has put the social order “on life support.” Tocqueville’s intermediate institutions have “largely been supplanted” and weakened by big government bureaucracies. National and state income support may be helpful but only if it comes without “harsh” rules that do not allow local agencies, churches, and charities to exercise their more humane personal administration. (WATCH: The Spectacle Ep. 87: Conservatives Think Power Is Icky ) A “complete change in direction” requires a dramatic response that would match the Progressive one that provoked the present crisis. Howard even presents a “practical mechanism” to achieve it. Congress would create “independent recodification commissions,” where the “structure built since the 1960s must be abandoned, not amended, and, area by area, replaced by a framework activated by human responsibility.” My experience is that such commissions would be staffed by insiders favoring the status quo; so perhaps Congress itself should run the whole process, whatever its faults, hopefully in contact with a President who legally would have to sign any proposed law. Howard concludes with Hayek that “the rule of law is effective … only insofar as it is part of the moral tradition of the community.” That is what Howard presents in his vision of the American experience and what an informed people would need to do to sustain it. To make this possible, they will need Howard’s book. It is only 84 pages long, easy to read, affordable, and required if America is to recover its everyday freedom.

"1","Editor’s Note: This is the ninth installment of Scott McKay’s new novel, King of the Jungle , which is being released exclusively at The American Spectator in 10 episodes each weekend in February, March, and early April, before its full publication on Amazon on April 12. So far in the story, our narrator Mike Holman, an independent media man and podcaster, has agreed to write a biography and work as a public-relations consultant with his friend and old college roommate, the billionaire industrialist Pierce Polk — only to find that Polk has built a small city in the jungles of Guyana as a redoubt away from the corrupt Joe Deadhorse administration back home in America. But Guyana has been invaded by Venezuela, as the corrupt Madiera regime in Caracas, doing the bidding of its foreign partners, seeks the vast mineral wealth of its jungles and the ocean off its coast, and Polk’s jungle paradise is now on the front lines of a hot war. The Venezuelans are pressing hard against the minuscule Guyanese military, but they’re finding that Polk and his men are a far more ferocious adversary than they expected. The situation is escalating, and the danger in the jungle — and elsewhere — is palpable… June 14, 2024, Mahdia, Guyana “Pop! Pop!” rang out the shots, and Cabrillo could see his men scrambling near the barbed-wire enclosure where the adult villagers were held from of the window of the police station. He figured this was the work of a sniper, and Cabrillo could see that the tall trees and medium-sized rise to the west of the little town center of Mahdia held a fertile habitat for enemy shooters to pick off his occupying force. He needed to make his forward headquarters here, because in the Potaro valley this was the biggest objective of them all. Except for Liberty Point, which they were to take as intact as possible. Cabrillo saw that to do that would be a nearly impossible mission, so his best option was to clear the rest of his objectives, try to isolate the Americans at Liberty Point and then pressure them into a surrender. And if that didn’t work, then build up enough of a concentrated force here, with reinforcements and colectivos relieving his troopers at the other small villages, mines and other objectives so that he could have virtually his entire brigade available to overwhelm the enemy in what would surely be a bloody massacre of a fight. He didn’t want to chew up his brigade. But at the end of the day, most of its men were Venezuelans, and Cabrillo was not. If Division Command was willing to sacrifice their lives for Liberty Point, which they were already calling Ciudad Chavismo, after the former Venezuelan president, then who was he to protest? Of course, his adjutant Carvajal was apoplectic. Cabrillo could tell Carvajal was near to the point of desertion after the first day. He was a sensitive little man, over prone to emotion. Cabrillo was near to the point of wanting to relieve him, but he was too deep into the fight to attempt to break in a new adjutant. So he tolerated Carvajal’s womanly protests. Xing was a different matter. He’d showed up after the initial assault on Mahdia, flying in on a little Cessna turboprop plane with crates full of Puerto Rican rum for the men in order that they might celebrate their great victory. And then he left again, after picking one of the women out of the barbed-wire camp in the soccer field across the street from the police station and having his way with her in the bed of an old Toyota pickup truck. The men saw it, and they were inspired. Cabrillo didn’t want to see him again. He’d told Xing abuse of civilians was off-limits. Xing asked him just who he thought he was to give orders. He thought about shooting the bastard, but he knew doing so would be his end. Perhaps that was Xing’s grand finale as the 53rd’s procurement specialist and liaison with the Chinese. And shooting Xing would certainly dampen the victory for his brigade. Some victory. What they’d done was land about a hundred men in 10 helicopters in the middle of the night while their jets were keeping the enemy’s fighter pilots and SAM operators busy, and then go house to house kidnapping the civilians and bringing them to the soccer field across the street from the police station where they had set up a small, crowded concentration camp. Cabrillo didn’t like it, and he especially didn’t like it when, inspired by Xing, some of the men had taken certain liberties with their female captives — liberties which had led to some suicidal attempts by the men to fight back. Several dozen dead residents of Mahdia were the result. There were few amenities in the fenced-in camp at the soccer field. On the second day they’d managed to string together a few canvas tents, so the angry civilians were at least somewhat out of the rain. But Cabrillo’s men needed billeting, so the Venezuelans would be occupying the houses of Mahdia. And there would be a whole lot more of them as he staged for the attack on Liberty Point. At least, that had been the plan. It was now coming apart to a substantial extent. The C-130 Hercules plane that was supposed to ferry the rest of the 53rd Jungle Infantry Brigade from the airfield at Tumeremo, where they had relocated for the follow-on deployments, to Mahida had crashed and blown up on the now- unusable runway at the airfield. Cabrillo figured it was a drone strike which had destroyed the runway just before the C-130 landed; 71 men and four pilots had been killed, with six troopers seriously injured and flown back to Tumeremo by helicopter and three, amazingly, walking away from the crash shaken but otherwise unhurt. They’d have to bring the rest in by helicopter, and resupply was going to be a problem without the use of that runway. And reinforcing the garrison at Mahdia in advance of going on offense was going to take a long time. At least, Cabrillo expected, they’d have air superiority. The enemy’s fighter pilots were vastly superior. Their intelligence had it the American Polk had recruited three aces, two from the U.S. Navy and one from their Air Force, who were retired and had been flying private jets. He’d also recruited three or four others with experience as fighter pilots. Interestingly enough, they were British and Argentinian, which marked a strange mix since those two nations had been at war some 42 years earlier. But in one of the few strokes of luck he’d had, the Americans hadn’t been able to get missiles for those planes. They were limited to using their guns. And while the pilots were good, they had to get in close against the Venezuelan jets to fight. So far Polk’s force had lost three of the 10 planes from their airfield on the other side of the Essequibo where his troops were not allowed to go, while the Venezuelans had lost four of what looked like it would be at least 14 jets able to fly. They would likely win the battle of attrition in the air. The Chinese who were taking over jet maintenance and repair at El Libertador were hard at work replacing the landing gear on the planes not too badly damaged in the sabotage attack which ruined the invasion’s first day, and in the coming days the word was that they’d be adding planes. And the Chinese were supplying their J-16 fighters as well, which were essentially the same thing as the Su-30’s they were using now. They had two; there were three more coming, was the word. With time, he felt like he had the advantage. If he could cut the enemy’s ability to resupply Liberty Point, he could starve them out. It would just take time. But those gunshots in the street were a reminder that Cabrillo’s plans had every possibility of going awry. He peered out of the corner of the window of the little office of the Chief of Police on the second floor, the only room upstairs not occupied by the captive children of the village, and he saw three of his men dead in the street and the rest running for cover as the shots rang out. And then he saw something which both amazed him and frightened him at the same time. It was, he would call it, a robot. It looked almost like a toy car, but with treads instead of wheels, and it had a stem on which was mounted a small fisheye camera and, as he stared at it through binoculars, a pair of pistols. Someone was remotely piloting this thing, and it was rolling along the street pot-shotting his men. “Ernesto!” he yelled at the private he was using as a messenger. “ Si, coronel? ” said the young man as he came running. “Go out there and tell the men to shoot that thing! It’s just a toy!” Ernesto nodded and thundered down the stairs. He could see him running from the front door in an effort to flag down the sergeant who was in charge of the camp. But almost as soon as he came into view Ernesto’s head exploded. That was not from the toy. Cabrillo knew the enemy now had at least one sniper as well. The toy car was quite agile, he saw. It would move quickly in the open, and then it would hide under a car or truck. A bullet would glance off it; it seemed to have a steel outer casing tough enough to protect its motor. Cabrillo knew someone would have to hit its camera to render it unusable. But that was a shot which would need to be taken up close. He figured he could perhaps do it himself, so he slid the window open just a bit to poke his rifle out, and… A loud crash ensued as the window exploded. Cabrillo could hear, or more accurately he could feel, a bullet whizzing past his head barely three inches away. Whoever was out there, the man was good. Damned good. The drone was continuing to pop off shots, this time from underneath a truck, and the men were firing back to no avail. Someone managed to throw a grenade in an attempt to blow it up; but the damned thing hit the truck’s fender and bounced away before exploding in front of the police station and blowing out the front window. “This is bullshit,” Cabrillo seethed. He found the stairs and bounded down them, crooking his finger at Carvajal who had been hiding behind the station’s reception desk. “I want you to kill that thing,” he said, pointing outside. “ Senor , it is…” “No excuses, damn you. Lead. Take eight men and kill it. Tackle it if you have to. It doesn’t have an unlimited supply of ammunition.” Carvajal knew he couldn’t disobey a direct order, Cabrillo could tell, but he wanted to. “Go, dammit!” he screamed at the stubby little major. Carvajal nodded, the fear on his face rendering him utterly pathetic in Cabrillo’s eyes, and he picked a squad of men to run out to the street and attempt to defeat the drone. Through the window, Cabrillo saw the muzzle flash from a distance, and he saw the impact of the bullet as it hit Carvajal center mass. He was dead before he hit the ground. There was a sniper in a tree on the hillside to the west of the soccer field. He had to be a thousand yards away, but his accuracy was nightmarish. Carvajal’s men were now pinned down behind a police car parked on the street. One by one they attempted to re-enter the safety of the police station; only half survived. And now the drone was moving again. It rolled to the sidewalk in front of the police station and began shooting through the blown-out window. Cabrillo retreated to the back of the station where seven of his men had taken refuge. “We have to get that thing!” he yelled. “Who is with me?” Silence and stone faces were his unexpected response. Just then he could hear a loud bang, and then a cheer from his men across the street in the soccer field. One of them had scored a hit on the drone with a grenade, though a big chunk of the building’s façade had been taken out in the process. The station might no longer be functional as a headquarters. Cabrillo figured that Mahdia General Hospital a block away could be a suitable replacement. The shots continued ringing out, and his men kept dying in the street. Cabrillo could see that at least one of the shooters was to the west or southwest. He got on his walkie-talkie and gave orders to the 531st battalion to charge that position. A few moments later, they were. Two ragged columns of men were hustling around the soccer field, a few of them dropping as they were hit, and making their way toward the hillside. But as they went, Cabrillo could hear a familiar sound. Motorcycles. Two, or was it three? He caught a glimpse of them zooming through the trees to the south of his vantage. The enemy had three snipers, and they were escaping. “Get them!” he barked into the walkie-talkie. “They’re getting away!” There was a lot of radio chatter after that, and the men were boarding requisitioned trucks to follow the motorcycles as they made their way east through the trees that sectioned the main part of town off from the ruined Mahdia airfield. Others were in a dead run attempting to cut off the enemy’s escape. A few minutes later, Cabrillo could hear what sounded like a stuttering detonation to the east. Boomboomboomboomboomboom. He knew what it was, and he cursed himself. He’d sent his men right into a jackpot the snipers had laid in for them. They must have run into a massive mine field in that jungle. Cabrillo could see smoke rising from the trees. A lot of smoke. It sickened him. And, as if on cue, the rain came with a vengeance. June 21 2024, Linden, Guyana I managed to get PJ out of Liberty Point. It practically took an act of Congress to get her out. And it’s a good thing, too. Not that she’s ever going to give me credit for that. As far as she’s concerned, letting me talk her out of that place was the worst example of me manipulating her there is. And honestly, I’m OK with that. When Roman, Charlie and Kurt, not to mention the mini army of deadly drones Kurt carried in his rucksack as they headed off to Mahdia, stitched up the Vinnies as they did, the effect was not what Hal and Pierce were going for. They figured they’d waste a nice percentage of the Vinnies’ main invasion force at Mahdia as it was gearing up to come after them at Liberty Point. That’s exactly what they did. And by all reasonable recognition it should have brought cooler heads to the table for a parlay about how this thing was going to be resolved. Clearly, Pierce and Hal had lots of Romans, Charlies and Kurts. They also had lots of high-tech weaponry that would make for colossal casualty counts the more the Vinnies wanted to press their occupation of Essequibo. But the analysis failed from there, because this wasn’t about Venezuela. It wasn’t about Madiera and his government. And the forces controlling them. After the first couple of days, when the Vinnies had absorbed such massive losses in occupying all those little villages and other assets in Essequibo, it was time to start negotiating. After all, it was clear that to hold them would be to commit the kinds of abuses the world is unlikely to tolerate for long. Even then, they would be getting an ever-increasing amount of trouble from the indigenous opposition rapidly building thanks to guys like my friend Earl. I’ll get to that in a minute. What I’m saying is that if you’re Madiera, you’d do this not because you wanted to occupy Essequibo. The expense associated with that alone made it a bad idea. Throw in the cost of governing a whole shitload of little bitty villages where everybody hates your guts, plus the international sanctions from being where you’re not supposed to be, and it just looks bad and worse. I think this is where that Latin mindset kicks in. The Venezuelans didn’t want to admit they’d bitten off more than they could chew. If they were able to recognize that, they’d have bluffed their way into a deal that would have gotten them what they were looking for, or at least some of it, with their Essequibo adventure. Especially when somebody — I think it was Pierce and Hal, but they wouldn’t admit it, and there were other sources saying it was the CIA, though it’s been a while since I saw those guys do anything effective outside of our borders — started a pretty well-organized amount of domestic trouble for Madiera. Remember General de la Vega? You thought he’d gone away when Madiera kidnapped his wife and kids and traded them for his exile to Miami. Well, de la Vega showed up on Univision trashing the invasion as a disaster, claiming that the Chinese were in charge of everything and calling for Madiera’s resignation. Asked what changed given that he’d tabbed Madiera as the rightful ruler, he said that he’d been under duress when he’d relented, and that the war changed everything. While de la Vega’s first emergence as a dissident leader had fizzled before it ever got going, this one was different. The Venezuelan expat community in South Florida got behind him and raised a bunch of money practically overnight, there were rumors of a couple of camps in El Salvador that sprang up to train guerillas to fight the government — and it was easy to get recruits given the flood of refugees who’d left Venezuela for Central America on their way north — and the streets of Venezuela’s cities turned bloody. Madiera couldn’t reinforce his gains in Essequibo. Not the way he wanted to. He all of a sudden needed every boot he could get on the ground back home. His recognition of that fact was … well, let me tell that part a little bit later. De la Vega reiterated that he would take power only as an interim president through the election in December. He said he would negotiate an honorable end to the war in Guyana and he would restore both market economics and human rights. “Venezuela must be a prosperous democracy again,” he said. “That starts with peace, the rule of law and then elections. I can accomplish those between now and the end of the year.” All of those things sounded good. They were the reason I talked PJ into coming with me to interview the pilots at the air base in Linden and then back to Georgetown. I’d had an email from her dad saying she wouldn’t talk to him; he’d said something immediately after Terre Haute that had really, really hacked her off. He said that if I could get her to come home, he’d fix everything. “I don’t know what you’ve convinced her of,” he said, “but she has a future back in California. I’m begging you to let me make that happen.” “Mr. Chang,” I said, “your daughter is a very smart, very strong woman. I’m making no decisions for her. She’s quite capable of handling herself. I think you should be proud of her.” I didn’t get a response back, but the exchange was unnerving enough — Peter Chang had the kind of influence with the Deadhorse administration which could result in a whole lot of trouble for yours truly. And with the FBI already nosing around back in Atlanta — Karen messaged me that the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia had a grand jury going about my dissemination of “classified information” about the Secret Service and Terre Haute, and that I was likely to catch a subpoena. It occurred to me that I would need to come home soon or else I might not be able to. Anyway, the effect of the war on PJ was fascinating. It turned her on. She was glowing. The night Roman, Charlie and Kurt made it back to Liberty Point, and there was a big celebration at the Grand Waica about their huge win, she cornered me behind a big fern not far from the concierge desk and just about choked me with her tongue. “I think we’ve passed that point we talked about,” she said. “Oh, you mean…” “We don’t need to stop at second base anymore.” “Are you sure?” “I feel so alive right now I can’t stand it. Don’t you?” “Well, I’m older. I’ve been in a war zone a couple of times. It’s not as new. But yeah, this thing between you and me has some legs on it.” She gave me a big smile. We caught a ride back to the suite at Liberty Lodge and that was that. PJ was a very early riser, and she insisted I become one too. “OK, Mike,” she said, nudging me awake just before the crack of dawn, “if we’re going to become a, you know, I’m going to have to train you. Get up.” I did, bitching about it, but PJ made it worthwhile. She was a clean freak, it turned out, and the best shower-helper I’ve ever seen. After breakfast, we made it down to Pierce’s bunker and control room. The joy of the previous evening had settled into what seemed like a satisfied calm. “Good day yesterday,” said Hal, as he sipped his coffee and surveyed the wall of surveillance screens. “Yeah, sounds like it,” I said. “What comes next?” “We’re going to keep harassing the enemy, force him onto the defensive.” “How does this end, do you think?” “Either badly, or maybe we do a deal, or, best hope, either Deadhorse wakes up and sends in the Marines or there’s a coup in Venezuela and this melts away.” “So you don’t think there’s a winning scenario here.” “Not from a military standpoint, no. Not if the Vinnies are willing to escalate this.” “So you’re about making Liberty Point as hard a target as you can, and hope for the best.” “I think later today we might have a development. We’ll see.” That was cryptic enough, so I took out my laptop and checked emails and messages. Which was when I had my interaction with Peter Chang. That I didn’t tell PJ about. Back home nobody was paying any attention to the war in Guyana, and it was starting to become awfully clear overt American help wasn’t coming our way. There was an incident in Washington that morning which made it obvious any hope of robust U.S. involvement down in the jungle was a fantasy. Dr. Diego Cardoza, a geopolitics expert who’d spent time on Trumbull’s National Security Council, was giving a speech on the threat China posed to America’s interests worldwide and, more specifically, to the homeland. Cardoza had written an op-ed at the Wall Street Journal warning that there were more than 35,000 military-age Chinese males who had come across the U.S. border in the previous 10 months, and he said he was in possession of proof that some or most of those illegals were not migrants but invaders — they were saboteurs, guerillas, hackers, terrorists and spies. And Cardoza had mentioned, in a follow-up interview on Fox News, that the war in Guyana was all about the Chinese getting their hands on the mines and oilfields of Essequibo. All of which generated some calls for Congressional investigations, and it was awfully splashy on the radio talk show circuit. A few days later, Cardoza was at the National Press Club to show the proof he claimed he had about Chinese infiltration. But he didn’t get to show it. As soon as Cardozo took the stage, he was rushed by three dozen Chinese men from the crowd who were calling him a racist. “Stop Asian Hate!” they screamed, as they rushed the podium and proceeded to beat him bloody. No one in the audience did much of anything. Not even the D.C. Metro Police officer who was there to provide security; he called the incident in, but of course it was streaming live on CSPAN, and everybody knew in real time what was happening. The Chinese left Cardozo with half his teeth knocked out, a detached retina, seven broken ribs, a fractured skull and a severe concussion. And the legacy media were covering the case as outraged citizens taking their frustrations out on a deranged racist. Even though it was by no means in evidence that any of these guys were citizens. The Chinese ambassador said that while he “abhorred violence,” the claims Cardozo had made were inflammatory and could not be allowed to poison Sino-American relations. And then around noon, a satellite image on the control-room wall showed a flotilla of vessels — dozens of fishing trawlers, houseboats, small freighters, and pleasure craft — leaving the harbor at Puerto Cabello escorted by that Chinese naval task force, heading east along the coast. If you weren’t allowed to talk about the Chinese infiltrators in America in Washington, D.C., then you certainly weren’t going to get any American help in stopping a Chinese- protected invasion fleet in Guyana. That was obvious. Hal was watching the Cardozo event on one of the monitors on the wall. Pierce had joined in, having been off doing something else in the morning. I could see from the expressions on both of their faces that the implications of that event were disturbing — and devastating. Pierce found me and whispered quietly, “I think you’ve done what you can in Liberty Point for now. Take your girl and get the hell out of here, quick.” “I was thinking the same,” I said. So we caught a chopper to Linden. I told PJ that I needed a photojournalist to document the goings-on at the air base. But when we landed at Linden, the relative calm of Liberty Point had become something else. There were pilots and ground crews scrambling around, and a huge hustle to get the four working A-4AR’s and two old Harriers in the air. They managed it, and everybody seemed to be jumping in cars and trucks to get the hell out of there. A few minutes later we found out why. The guy in command of the air base in Linden was a retired Air Force bomber wing commander named Bob Arness. When we landed, he and his assistant, a heavyset black lady whose name was Lucille, drove up in an old Jeep and he demanded we get in. “Now!” he said. “Hustle up unless you have a death wish!” We got in the Jeep and Lucille hit the gas. “What’s going on?” I asked, as we shot west along the runway toward the Linden-Kwakwani Road and the Demerara River. “Missile…” said Arness, just as we could hear a very loud ripping sound and a series of huge booms behind us. Almost immediately thereafter, the Jeep was shaken — hard — by a series of shock waves. When I looked behind, there was a fiery smoke cloud which reminded me of the pyroclastic cloud from Mount St. Helen’s eruption in that old Pierce Brosnan movie. Perhaps not quite that dramatic, but more than enough for me to let loose a string of expletives. And that earned me a nudge from PJ, who had her camera out and was filming the entire thing. “We got all the good planes out,” said Lucille. “And the guys should…” “Yeah, I hope so,” Arness muttered. “How’d you know the missiles were coming?” I asked. “Early warning radar,” he said. “And real-time satellite imagery. They fired from the central part of Venezuela, which was their mistake; they should have had those missiles in Tumeremo. Gave us an eight- minute head start.” “I’m shocked you got your jets in the air that quickly,” said PJ. “Well, we got lucky there. We were launching anyway. The enemy is usually patrolling in the late afternoon, and with the boats they have coming it’s almost certain they’re going to be out to provide air cover.” “You’re attacking those boats?” “We’re attacking their planes.” “Seems like it’s a suicide mission.” “It is what it is. Our tactics are better. But we’ve got to be perfect, because they have air-to-air missiles and we just have guns. And now we’re not going to have anything since it’s a pretty sure thing they just took out our weapons stores along with our fuel.” “And your runway, I imagine,” said PJ. “I’d say that’s correct,” said Arness. “We have a last- ditch mission today and then it’s bug-out time.” “How come you don’t have missiles?” “Because the A-4AR uses Sidewinders, and those are damned hard to find. Deadhorse raided all the stocks he could, all over the world, to send to Ukraine. They’ve been using them as surface-to-air missiles against the Russians. So we’ve really been up shit creek getting the weapons we need. We were lucky enough that I had a contact who could get us the M-61 Vulcan cannons to replace what those planes came with.” It struck me how desperate this situation really was. Lucille was taking us over the Wismar/Mackenzie bridge into the town of Linden, which wasn’t all that happening a burg. Arness was on his cell, though I couldn’t hear what he was saying. Finally, he hung up, turned back to look at us and said “You’re in luck. Your chopper turned back around and he’s going to pick you up at the ballfield.” I could see that he was telling the truth, because as we traveled that road toward a sports park only a couple miles away there was a helicopter vectoring in and landing. “What’s next for you guys?” I asked Arness. “Suriname,” he said. “Our secondary base is at the Kabalebo Nature Resort in Suriname, about 130 miles southeast of here. They’ve got a decent little airstrip there and the government is willing to get out of our way for a nice fee Pierce negotiated.” “Man,” I said. “This is some wildcat operation, isn’t it?” “Never seen anything like it.” I shook his hand, Lucille wished us well and we hopped on the chopper. “Back to Liberty Point?” I asked when I put the headset on. “Nah, you don’t want to do that,” said the pilot. “They got hit with a missile strike at the airfield and a few other places. I’m taking you to Georgetown.” “Oh, no,” said PJ. “How bad are the casualties?” I asked. “They don’t know yet. It’s pretty chaotic down there.” “We should go and help,” PJ said. I shook my head. “No. We need to get to Georgetown. We’ve got to get the word out about what’s happening down here.” Things weren’t better in the capital. We were supposed to land at the helipad at Sentinel Port Management’s facility on the Demerara. That wasn’t possible, because the whole place was a blown-out wreck. So were a whole host of other targets in the capital, including the Parliament building. And the Guyana Police Force headquarters. And Camp Ayanganna, which was the military base in the capital. And the airport. And Exoil’s office complex next to the airport. There were pillars of smoke rising from close to a dozen large fires around Georgetown. So instead, he set us down in the parking lot in front of the Marriott. The place was heavily guarded, but it seems like I was known. The two big black guys in berets and what looked like Guyanese military uniforms guarding the front door waved us to the concierge, where we were directed to one of the little ballrooms. There, we were given ID badges on lanyards and directed to the grand ballroom. Because the Marriott had become the seat of government now that most of the government buildings had been hit by missiles. I remembered Ravi Darke, the head of the Guyanese military. He was there, surrounded by a host of minions and it looked like they were keeping awfully busy. People were sitting at banquet tables with their faces inches away from laptop screens, and it looked a little like a war room. But of course, these guys were helpless. Missiles were raining down on every security asset in Guyana at this point, and they had no defense for it. There was a flotilla headed from Venezuela that was almost surely going up the Essequibo, and they had no defense for that, either. Hell, they wouldn’t have much defense if that flotilla was coming for Georgetown. The only defense they had was Pierce and his operation, and for all we knew that was out of commission, too. We hung off to the side, but then Jaganoo, the Prime Minister, saw me and collected us. Jaganoo led PJ and me to a second-floor suite, and then sat us down. “Beer?” he asked. It seemed like a bizarre offer, but I couldn’t turn it down. Neither could PJ. “Been a long day,” I said, tipping my bottle to Jaganoo. “I’m sure yours has been the same.” “I am glad that you are safe,” said Jaganoo, “and I thought you should hear it from me first. We are in contact with the Madiera government about a cease-fire.” “You’re surrendering?” “There is no choice. Earlier today the Venezuelans took Bartica. Because of that, they now control the mouth of the Essequibo. They’ve killed half our parliament and they have cut off the capital from the rest of the country by destroying the airport.” “They can’t hold what they’ve taken,” said PJ. “They’re going to fall apart. The whole Venezuelan government is going to topple.” “We must save as many lives as we can.” “You mean like at Port Kaituma?” “OK, PJ, take it easy,” I said. “How can he just give his country away?” she said, her face screwed up in a rage. “It’s been decided,” said Jaganoo. “No one wants this, but we are without options.” Just then my cell rang. It was Pierce. “I have to take this call,” I said. Jaganoo pointed me to a bedroom. “Are you all right?” I asked him. “We’re good,” he said. “Airfield is shot up pretty bad and they whacked the hydro plant, but we still have some juice. And what pisses me off more than anything, they hit the Torch.” “How chickenshit. You guys were almost finished with that.” “Tell me about it. Mostly we’re just shaken up. About a dozen wounded, nobody too seriously, nobody dead which is a miracle thanks to our early-warning radar and real-time sat imagery. But it’s not all bad news here. We have the Cuban.” “You what?” “Cabrillo. We nabbed him.” “How in the hell did you do that?” “Ol’ boy made the mistake of going out to check on the progress of his airfield getting rebuilt. Somebody hit his ride with an RPG, and then he got dragged off into the woods.” “Well, that sucks to be him. Roman and his guys are good, right?” “This wasn’t Roman.” “No? Who was it?” “Believe it or not, Earl and the IM’s pulled it off. They also shot up the guards at that soccer field in Mahdia and got the civilians out. Or at least the adults — the kids we’ll go get next.” “You’re kidding.” “Nope. So right now Cabrillo is making a little hostage confession speech we’ll send back to Caracas, and maybe that’ll put a stop to these damned Iranian missiles they’re shooting at us.” “Pierce, we’re with Jaganoo. They’re surrendering.” “They’re what? The hell they are.” “The Vinnies hit Parliament. They took out the airport, the army base, the police headquarters, a bunch of other stuff. They hit your port facility, too. Plus they took Linden out, but you already know that.” “Yeah. I know about the port. They didn’t hit it in time.” “What’s that mean?” “Probably find that out later today.” “Jaganoo says they took Bartica, too.” “Yeah, that was the Black Wasps.” “The what?” “ Avispas Negras. Cuban special forces. They shot up the Guyanese army guys who were guarding the town with an airstrike, and they gave up almost immediately when the Black Wasps showed up in choppers. They had plenty of MANPADs; nobody bothered firing one.” “Not great.” “These guys might be soldiers. They aren’t warriors. And there’s the question of leadership, too.” “So what’s the play?” “Well, we’re not done. We’re gonna hold out. And any Guyanese who want to keep fighting, we’ll get ‘em weapons and comms and whatever supplies they need. I still have procurement guys around the world and we’ve got lots more stuff coming.” “Pierce, you don’t think it’s over? What if Ishgan calls on you to give up?” “Ohhh, it is not over. Not by a long shot. In a few hours things are gonna look completely different on the ground.” “Yeah, but if Georgetown sues for peace…” “This is what I need from you,” he said. “ Don’t let him . That’s the key. You’ve got to stall Ishgan — if it’s even Ishgan who’s still calling the shots, because we found a whole bunch of interesting things.” “Anything on that you can tell me?” “Check your email when you get off this call.” “All right.” “But do not let these guys throw in the towel. Not just yet. All right? Whatever it takes, I need another three or four hours.” “OK. I’ll do what I can.” June 22, 2024, Georgetown, Guyana PJ and I didn’t have a place to stay in Georgetown. The Grand Coastal was out of rooms, and so were all the other hotels in town. We ended up crashing in the pool house at Tom Burnham’s place in Lusignan, which frankly was a sizable stroke of luck. After I finished my call with Pierce, I went back to the main room of Jaganoo’s suite at the Marriott and saw that he was becoming more and more agitated with PJ. She was giving him what-for about the idea of giving up. I was quickly scanning the email that Pierce had sent on my phone, so I didn’t say anything. I just listened. I could tell that Moses Jaganoo was not in the custom of listening to lectures from women. And to be fair, from what I knew of PJ it wasn’t all that customary for her to talk to anybody like she was talking to Jaganoo. PJ was always very polite and friendly. But I think she had seen, heard and endured enough over the past few days and weeks, and she wasn’t very friendly anymore. So finally, I turned on the “record” app on my phone. And I stepped in. “OK,” I said. “Let’s turn the temperature down.” “But Mike, he’s…” “No, PJ, let’s calm it down. Please.” “Thank you,” said Jaganoo, who was recovering his carefully practiced composure. I took PJ’s hand and I smiled at her. “The thing is, Mr. Prime Minister, she’s absolutely correct. It would be treason for you to surrender right now.” That took him aback. “And sir, you’re not really in a position to defend against accusations of treason.” “Why, I am deeply offended at the statement, Mr. Holman…” “Stabroek-Penitence Holdings. That ring a bell?” “Yes, of course,” he said, stammering a little. “What of it?” “You’ve been a fairly broke lawyer and politician all your life, Mr. Jaganoo. Three years ago you ended up in a partnership now worth more than $150 million with real estate property all over the Caribbean. How did you pull that off? Where’d you get the equity for that?” “What are you accusing me of, sir?” “I’m not accusing you of anything. I’m just asking what about you made Mr. George Ling of Sino-Americas Harvest Limited, who in reality is the Chinese Communist Party’s number one espionage operative in Latin America, interested in cutting you in for a one-third share of his real estate company. You guys must be close, right?” “He’s a business partner. I know nothing of espionage.” “Yeah, I don’t think that’s right. I think you know plenty about espionage, and I think you’ve been waiting for this invasion from the very beginning. Where is the president?” “He’s in the presidential suite.” “I think it’s time we go and see him.” “He’s indisposed.” “Indisposed?” “President Ishgan has had an emotional breakdown. He is resting comfortably under sedation.” “I see. And are we free to leave?” There was a very, very long pause. “Of course,” he said, quite shakily. “But I should caution you that the capital is a dangerous city given the missile attacks. Be very careful out there.” “Is that a threat?” PJ exploded. “Did you just fucking threaten us?” “Easy, girl,” I said, squeezing her hand. “Easy. We’re going to take our chances. Mr. Jaganoo, what I’m here to ask you is that you do nothing until tomorrow morning.” “As I said, it has already been decided. I’m sorry.” “Decide what you want, sir, but the deal I will make with you is that if you do nothing publicly, if you announce no cease-fire or surrender, then your commercial history similarly will not go public. My team back in Atlanta has it all, and they await my instructions.” “Now it is you making threats.” “No, sir, I’m not making threats. I’m proposing a mutually beneficial arrangement which could work out very well for all involved. Give me and Pierce Polk twelve hours, and you might find yourself with very superior options to those you currently have, but if you act now it’ll be…” “Messy,” said PJ, following my lead. Jaganoo looked at me for what seemed like a long time. I could see sweat forming on his brow. PJ started to say something. I squeezed her hand and she shut up. “I require certain considerations,” he said. “I think we can work something out. What are you looking for?” “I want to be on the board of Polk’s stock exchange.” “I’ll let him know.” “And I want his endorsement of my candidacy for president in the snap elections we will call for next month.” “Well, it would seem like if an arrangement were made it would be to Pierce’s benefit to do something like that.” “And I want $100 million in cash.” “A very reasonable number. I’ll relay that to Pierce.” “I require a response in one hour’s time.” “OK, then. Let me get to work.” We grabbed our bags and left. I could tell PJ was ready to explode, but I managed to keep her quiet until we got outside of the hotel. “Holy shit !” she said. “You just bribed the Prime Minister to keep him from treason! You’re a lot more interesting guy than I thought, Mike.” “I haven’t done anything yet,” I said. “What I did do is make sure Mr. Jaganoo is done in politics, though.” I pulled out my phone, selected the app and tapped the “play” button. When PJ heard the recording, her eyes lit up. “Oh, that is sooo hot,” she said after a few seconds. I stopped the playback and sent the recording out to Pierce, Flip Hardison, Colby, Tom Burnham and a bunch of other people, with a message asking them not to share it until further instructions. Burnham immediately messaged me back. “You in Georgetown?” “Yes.” “Where?” “In front of the Marriott.” “Wait five minutes.” There was a Land Rover with an Exoil logo on the side door pulling up to us in three. “Mr. Holman?” the driver, a black guy I could have sworn was Idi Amin’s cousin, said out of the window. “Mr. Burnham sent you?” “Yes, sir,” he said. “Please do hop in.” So PJ and I did, and he took off to the east down the Seawall Public Road. The guy’s name was Desmond. He was Jamaican. He was an engineer, or at least he was until around lunchtime. “They struck our offices,” he said. “Seventy-four people dead. I will have my vengeance. You and your man must succeed.” I could feel PJ shaking in the back seat next to me. She was trying to hold back her rage. We turned onto Railway Embankment Road, still heading east. Desmond was talking about how the public was inflamed by the failure of the government to do anything to fight the Venezuelans and how citizens’ militias were springing up. “Your man Polk had the right idea,” he was saying. “But the people don’t have the resources he has.” “It’s a problem,” I said. “Ultimately the people are what will solve this. The people are who pay the price for their poor leaders.” “No doubt.” “I have a Heckler & Koch 416 rifle,” he said. “I’ll be going home and getting it after I drop you off. I’ll stand with the militia in Lusignan, where I live.” “What’s Lusignan?” asked PJ. “It’s the ritzy neighborhood on the golf course where all the Exoil people hang out,” I said. “East of the city.” “You know your Georgetown well,” said Desmond. Burnham’s house had turned into a headquarters facility of its own, since they’d blown up Exoil’s offices with that missile. “I leave you here,” said Desmond, “and then I join the militia. This isn’t even my country, but it seems we have to fight shit politicians everywhere. The enemy, the traitors among us…” “Best of luck to you, Desmond,” I said. He nodded and waved, and we made our way through the crowd in the front yard. “A lot of angry folks here,” said PJ as we picked up shreds of conversations along the way to the front door. “Yep,” I said. There was a twenty-something kid who answered the door when I knocked on it. Unlike Desmond, I could immediately tell he was an engineer. The glasses gave it away. “You’re Mr. Holman,” he said in a brogue-y East Coast accent. “I’ve seen your podcast! I’m Sal O’Reilly.” “Nice to meet you, Sal. Irish-Italian mix, huh?” “I’m a mutt, yep.” “Classic white-privileged kid from…” “South Philly.” “Got it. This here is PJ.” “I know you, too. You’re Pauline Chang. They did you wrong, ma’am.” “Thanks,” said PJ. “But call me PJ.” “Mr. Burnham wouldn’t be around, would he?” I asked. “Yes! Sorry. He’s upstairs in the office with some people, but I know he needs to see you. Go right up.” So we did. “Do you think these are, like…” PJ was saying. “This is who the Vinnies didn’t take out when they hit the Exoil Guyana headquarters,” I said, “and now there are two super-wealthy American companies at war with Venezuela.” “I don’t understand. Why would they hit Exoil?” “Because if there’s nobody left to run Exoil’s operations in Guyana, Exoil sells the thing to…” “China,” she said. “Damn.” “Sino-Petro is already a partner in those offshore oilfields. It’s nothing to just get a check over to them and bow out, and then nobody cares when the fields are licensed through the new conquering lackey government.” “I hate everybody,” she said. “Well, all these people standing around looking for a fight to get in might be an indication they’ve grossly, grossly miscalculated,” I said. Finally, after dodging a host of people hanging around in the upstairs den we managed to get into Burnham’s office. He had a Zoom call going with his corporate people in Houston and, surprisingly enough, Ravi Darke, the head of the Guyanese military. “Mike, glad you’re here,” Burnham said. “I heard you almost bought it at Linden.” “I felt the shock wave,” I said. “It was pretty lucky stuff.” “Well, there’s no time to fill you in, so I’ll try to do that later. But as we talk this through, feel free to jump in. You’ve talked to Pierce? I can’t get through.” “Like 20 minutes ago, yeah.” “OK, good,” he said and then pointed to the Zoom call screen on his wall. “First, Mike Holman, this is Brett Gilchrist, Exoil CEO. Rob Owens, head of field security, Tina Williams, VP of corporate external relations, Walt Zeiling, governmental affairs. And Brigadier Darke you already know. Also, everybody, this is PJ Chang; she’s with Mike. I understand she’s a hell of a photojournalist.” They all nodded their greetings when PJ and I sat next to Burnham and entered the video frame. “Sorry, guys. Brigadier, please continue.” “The issue,” Darke said, “is that the surviving members of Parliament are with Jaganoo. And so the votes for surrender are there.” “What’s the state of the GDF?” Gilchrist asked. He was talking about the Guyanese Defense Force. “We lost a third of our men when Bartica surrendered,” Darke said. “The rest will have to hold the capital and the eastern coast in case the enemy attempts to swallow all of Guyana.” “Will your men hold the capital?” asked Owens. “We will certainly do our best,” Darke said. “That’s not what I’m asking. Will your men hold the capital against this cabal trying to give away two thirds of your country?” “You’re asking about a coup d’etat.” “Brigadier,” said Gilchrist, “it sounds a hell of a lot like you’ve already had one. The question is, are you going to sanction it?” I leaned to Burnham. “Are we saying that Jaganoo had his allies in Parliament hang back and let the patriots get killed by that missile strike?” I asked him. “We don’t know that,” said Burnham, “but it sure does come off that way.” “What about Ishgan? Has anybody talked to him? They told me he had a breakdown and they had him sedated.” “Out of pocket and out of the picture. I don’t think he’s the president anymore.” “Then it’s definitely a coup d’etat.” Burnham shrugged and nodded. “I don’t know that I have the authority,” Darke was saying. “A majority of the remaining parliament voted earlier today to make Jaganoo acting president, and…” “Hang on,” I said. “If I can jump in, I might be able to contribute a few things.” Gilchrist and Darke both nodded, and I relayed what Pierce had said about the situation at Liberty Point, and I noted that they were going to relocate the little air force to the jungle resort airstrip in Suriname. And then I noted that Jaganoo had told me his price for holding off on the surrender until morning. Burnham uploaded the recording to the Zoom call and everyone heard it. “Jeez,” said Owens. I could see in Darke’s face that we’d had him wrong. He wasn’t a traitor. He was just in over his head. “I will do as you ask,” he said, “but if I am to assume power it will be for a very short time and then, when a new election is held, I will retire.” “I have to talk to Mr. Polk,” I said, “but would anyone here object if we told Jaganoo his terms are acceptable? I want to stall him so there’s time to put whatever plan in place that we can.” “I think it’s the only play,” said Burnham. “Rob?” “Tell him whatever. We need to buy some time.” “Mr. Zeiling, maybe you guys talked about this, but is there nothing the U.S. government is going to do?” Before he could answer, Gilchrist stepped in. “The Navy offered to evacuate our offshore platforms. And they recalled the ambassador in Caracas.” “That’s it?” “So far,” Zeiling said. “But Trumbull is interested in doing a fly-in,” said Gilchrist. “We’re trying to figure out how to get him into Georgetown with the airport knocked out.” “Boy, that would send a signal,” I said. “Pretty good politics, too.” “Almost certain to get him indicted under the Logan Act,” Zeiling said, laughing. I looked at Burnham. “I need to call Pierce,” I said. He nodded, and he pointed to the balcony. “Go out there. Cell reception in here is atrocious.” Mine was a satellite phone, so it didn’t matter, but I went on the balcony and called Pierce. He answered immediately and I told him where I was. “You’re on speaker,” he said, “and I’ve got Hal and a couple of his guys with me. By the way, the Vinnies just surrendered Mahdia 10 minutes ago.” “They what?” “Yeah. We’ve been using a swarm of these quad-copter drones that drop grenades on ‘em, and we’ve been picking them off all day. Finally they all came out and waved the white flag, and they brought the kids out of the police station. So that’s over and Earl and the IM’s are retaking the place. We have the Vinnies fenced in at the soccer field now, but there aren’t a lot of them left.” “Hang on,” I said, and I leaned into Burnham’s office. “Tom, Pierce says the Venezuelans just gave up in Mahdia.” “Oh,” said Pierce, “tell Burnham I just emailed him a link he’s going to want to see, in about four minutes.” So I did, and Burnham put up the link in the “share screen” function on the Zoom call. I was looking at it through the window from the balcony. It was footage from a drone, and you could see the flotilla of Venezuelan boats escorted by those three Chinese warships as they made their way eastward near the coast. I then quickly filled Pierce in on the conversations with Jaganoo and Darke. “OK, OK,” he said, “but wait up a minute.” Pierce was telling me that the IM’s had set up a training camp at a little place in the far south called Yupukari, which was along the Rupunari River, and people were coming out of the woodwork to join up. He said the Venezuelans had sent two choppers down there to occupy the place on the first day of the invasion and both of them had been hit with MANPADs. Only six Vinnies managed to survive the crash landings and the locals had managed to dispose of them after about three days. There was a former British SAS lieutenant who was running a research station for the black caiman down there, and the guy turned out to be a pretty kick-ass military commander. “Too bad he can’t train the caiman,” I said. “Well, apparently one of the Vinnies ran and jumped in the river as the locals were chasing him down,” Pierce said with a laugh, “and the caiman got him. So maybe he did train ‘em.” Just then his voice changed. “OK, here we go,” he said. I looked at the drone footage, and it showed a couple of big explosions on two of those Chinese ships happening almost simultaneously. “Biiiig badaboom!” said Pierce. “What the hell?” I said. “That would be the ARA Santa Cruz ,” said Pierce, “newly equipped with an upgraded power plant and the Mark 48 Mod 7 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System torpedo,” he said. “I’m not even going to tell you how much this cost. Worth every penny.” Three more explosions hit the third Chinese ship and a couple of the bigger boats in the flotilla. The Chinese sailors were lowering their lifeboats as the warships began listing. “You just declared war on China, Pierce,” I said. “Holy cow.” “Nah,” he said. “They’ve been at war with me for a good while now. I just started fighting. Oh, by the way, tell Tom I have another link for him.” I did, and another window popped up on Burnham’s wall. This looked more like satellite imagery. Pierce said it was from a town called Tumeremo, which was where the Vinnies had been staging the bulk of their invasion from. The satellite camera was zooming in on what looked like a fairly deserted road, and there were six trucks, or what looked like trucks, parked along it. “Those would be our Iranian friends,” he said, and I realized he was talking about missile launchers. “That’s what hit…” “Linden. And Liberty Point. And Georgetown,” Pierce said. Just then, there were two shadows moving quickly across the image, and shortly behind them were four large explosions. And then several secondary explosions behind them. “Fatteh you, you bastards,” said Pierce. I think he was talking about the Fatteh 11 missile, the Iranian-made weapon the Vinnies had used on us. “We’re settling all family business tonight. Keyser Soze! ” I laughed. “Good grief, Pierce. Could you butcher your movie references any worse? And why didn’t you tell me you had all this going on?” “Operational security, I guess. In case they got you.” “Well, I need to tell Jaganoo something. He’s the key to this, I guess. Tell me what you want to do.” “Sure. Call him and tell him he gets everything he wants if he holds off. And then Ravi can go and arrest him and run his coup.” “OK, will do.” “Hey, Earl is here. Earl, how’d you like to be president of Guyana?”"
"1","C ussin’ is on the rise. It’s no surprise that F-bombs and associated maledictions are flying around at loading docks, at construction sites, under NBA baskets, and wherever our addlepated chief executive happens to be at any given time, but in recent years they have invaded the more cultured sectors of society. Last week I viewed in a theater an innocent-looking rom-com called Anyone but You . It is a loose and far-removed remake of Shakespeare’s Much Ado about Nothing , in which sophisticated women, upper-class professional types, mirrored by affluent men, dropped enough F-bombs to make me think I’d mistakenly walked into a Chris Rock concert. And it’s not just me. Or my imagination. Studies done on this issue have found a meteoric rise in obscene language. One survey from Britain found a third of respondents used strong language more than they did five years ago. Another , also from Britain, found that 60 percent of respondents said they dropped F-bombs, among other vulgarities, into their conversation every day. (READ MORE from Tom Raabe: The LGBTQ Conquest of America ) In the business world also, employees, particularly managers, are tossing out more expletives these days. One financial and corporate research platform reviewed conference call transcripts from around the world in 2021 and found an uptick of swearing of 60 percent from 2020 and a staggering 80 percent from 2018. On the screen, big and small, anyone with memory reaching back a few decades surely notices the proliferation of F-bombs, s-words, b-words, c-words, et al. in today’s offerings. VidAngel, a streaming service that allows viewers to fast-forward through objectionable content, has found that the level of profanity, blasphemy, and obscene language in 2020 was nine times that in 1980. A lot of that increase can be laid at the feet of streaming content, which does not restrict language as does cable and over-the-air broadcasting. The first season of the first Netflix original series, House of Cards , starting in 2013, featured 199 instances of profanity, while season 4 of Stranger Things , in 2022, had 345. So, the question is: What the, um, heck is going on? Ask that of the egghead class, and you’ll get egghead answers. Apologies, rather — favorable explanations of and encouragements for even more potty-mouthing. A lot of attention is accorded the F-word. This word, in my experience, has always stood at the outer limits of vulgarity, the most intense, and verboten, of obscenities. But it is today’s go-to, the most popular, and versatile, expletive out there, capable of employ as all parts of speech but pronoun, conjunction, and preposition. The word has benefited from (or suffered from) delexification, which occurs when a word’s function is expanded to the point that its original meaning is lost. “In other words,” writes Valerie Fridland, in Psychology Today , “a decrease in use of a word’s literal meaning, coupled with an increase in more figurative use, weakens its meaning over time.” But also, the experts accord swear words practical benefit. Fridland cites research “that suggests that swearing can also be cathartic, providing an emotional outlet, and social, strengthening peer relationships and establishing intimacy.” (READ MORE: Can Blacks Be Racist? ) Another researcher, Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, points to physical benefits in swearing. Launching some F-bombs seems to deaden one’s pain sensors. He convinced participants in one study to submerge their hands in ice-cold water and then say a swear word or an inoffensive word to see if the obscenity helped them manage the pain. His conclusion: “They’ll keep their hand in the water longer in the swearing condition.” Swearing also makes you physically stronger. In another study Stephens had people squeeze a hand-gripping device while speaking “French.” “People will grip that with more force when they’re repeating a swear word over repeating a neutral word,” Stephens says. It’s also associated with honesty, according to some. Said David Stillwell, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge, “Swearing is often inappropriate but it can also be evidence that someone is telling you their honest opinion. Just as they aren’t filtering their language to be more palatable, they’re also not filtering their views.” However rationalized and encouraged, the boom in dirty language still evinces a deficit, a paucity in vocabulary and expression. It seems in many cases to be a fallback for the empty spaces of conversation. And its ubiquity has stripped it of its power. It no longer delivers the shock it sets out to deliver. Note the syllogism: Its use is ubiquitous; its ubiquity renders it less potent as a swear word; people thus feel safer using it and use it more; this overuse robs it of the potency and effect that it used to convey in the first place. As Steven Pinker once wrote about the F-word, quoted in an article in Elle , “[W]hen it is overused, the word shifts from taboo to normal and doesn’t have the same effect. We’ve seen that happen in the twentieth century.” It still packs negative power, however, with persons of a certain age and religious or political stripe. Cursing in front of old- school types still moves the needle negatively. In one study , researchers found that bad words themselves leave “a negative impression on others, even those who are not offended by profanity. According to the analysis, people who swear are perceived as being unintelligent, untrustworthy, and less likeable.” As blue language, particularly the F-word, becomes routinized, it loses its punch and only demonstrates a lack of vocabulary and expression, and even thought. There is nothing more tiring, and unimaginative, than people filling blank spaces in a conversation with a tirade of reflexive F-bombs. (READ MORE: ‘Road Diets’ Will Give Los Angeles Drivers Indigestion ) It belittles them … and the language. As much as vulgarity’s champions want to deny it, the Irish proverb still holds true: “Profanity is ignorance made audible.”"
"1","A s I write this, the procession of the recumbent Christ passes through the streets of the town that has welcomed me every summer, over in the northwest of Spain. It is the procession of the Holy Burial. The Divine Offices of Good Friday have already been held, the Blessed Sacrament has been consumed, and in the churches of the Christian universe the tabernacles are empty; with their open doors, warm light, the recollection of praying orphans. I am always overcome by a deep melancholy, the pain of orphanhood, after the celebration of the Passion of the Lord. For the rest of the afternoon and all of Saturday, the death of God, Jesus is not in the varieties of bread and wine in earth’s tabernacles. We remember, or rather, we recreate or repeat, that bewilderment felt by apostles and disciples when after so many promises and prophecies the hour of truth came, and Christ died on the cross, died as a man, died and was buried, and then there was silence on earth, and only a tiny space was left for that which today we call faith. (READ MORE from Itxu Diaz: The Best Kind of Hippie: A Classy One ) The Scriptures imply that the apostles were scared to death. No wonder. With their leader dead, they would be next. And they knew not whether their blood would run before that strange Resurrection of which Jesus spoke to them, but of which they understood almost nothing. Really, they believed in their Friend, but it was an act of love, not of understanding. I like to pretend to be brave and think that I would remain watching over the door of the tomb, knees to the ground, and my forehead resting on that great slab that sealed it, watching over the Friend. But the truth is that bravery is an intermittent virtue in my history, so I would most likely have hidden under the robes of the stoutest apostle, always with a window nearby in case the Romans came to turn me into mortadella for supper. Be that as it may, the holy Sabbath is the day of God’s silence. The hour of man’s truth. Believing, loving, and following Christ , even in the midst of persecutions, may be easy when one is watching the Master perform miracles here and there, but it becomes an uphill struggle when his voice is silenced, after hours of cruel torment, and his body is laid out and shrouded. No reasonable person could understand, in the midst of the scourging, that, being God, he would not have a thunderbolt split in two the executioners who tortured him so viciously, the idiots who insulted, betrayed and humiliated him — today we are still those idiots — or those who nailed him to the cross amidst mockery. It is as if, in the infinite pride of mankind, we could accept the suffering of God made flesh, if it is to redeem our guilt, but not the humiliation, not the mockery, not the macabre laughter and the cries of, “If you are God, get down from the cross.” Jesus accepted everything, including the mockery, and that is why the Calvary of Christ was disconcerting and terrible for the hearts of the apostles, and that is why indignation and pain were followed by terrible fear; deep down I love it, because that fear is human, after all, the first Christians were flesh and blood like you and me. (READ MORE: Notes From a Traveler ) At sundown on Saturday evening, in the first instances of Sunday, during the darkest night ever known on earth, from nothing a light shall be lit. It will be done by a priest in every church, but it could well be an angel sent by God, who with a small match will light a fire, which will be blessed, and from that fire a candle will be lit, and with it another, and another, and another, and another, until the temple is filled with a gentle light, and we are finally awakened from our hopelessness, to emerge from the cave of our fears, and understand that Christ is truly God, and that we are still ordinary men, fallen always towards evil, betrayal, and fear, but redeemed by the infinite mercy of a God who, besides being magnanimous and all-powerful, is funny, because, when we contemplate his passion, death, and resurrection, it is undeniable that he is a master scriptwriter. We would expect nothing less from a God who sent his Son to earth to bless wine for all eternity. Let us toast, then, if it is already Sunday. Happy Easter, dear friends and readers!"
"2","The GOP’s majority in the House of Representatives was already very narrow — and it’s getting even narrower. But could it get narrow enough that Democrats actually take control this year — before the election? Some political commentators have been contemplating that possibility in the wake of the surprising news that Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) is stepping down early, amid reports that other Republicans are contemplating doing the same given frustration with the chaotic chamber and the temptations of private sector paydays. A closer look at the House math, though, suggests a full flip to Democrats is an extremely far-fetched scenario. Here’s why. Once Gallagher resigns on April 19, the House will be composed of 217 Republicans and 213 Democrats , with five vacant seats. On April 30, there is a special election to fill a vacancy in New York’s 26th District, which Democrats are expected to win. If so, once the result is certified and the winner is sworn in, the House will have 217 Republicans and 214 Democrats (and four vacancies). A 217-214 majority is extremely narrow, making it very challenging to pass partisan measures without total party unity. A mere two Republican defections could sink a bill, if no Democrats support it. But fully flipping control is more difficult. It would require four more unexpected Republican resignations (or deaths). That’s because a new vacancy in a Republican seat puts the GOP down one seat, but it doesn’t add a seat to the Democratic column. So three new Republican resignations would just mean a 214-214 House (which would be pretty wild). But the majority needed to elect a Democratic speaker wouldn’t yet be there. Another GOP resignation would put the House at 214 Democrats and 213 Republicans. There would clearly be immense pressure on Republicans eyeing the exits to not be the one person whose resignation would give Democrats the House, so that number of resignations seems unlikely. A flip looks even more far-fetched once you realize that there’s a short time window for this to happen, because Republicans’ majority is going to get bigger very soon. The special election to fill Kevin McCarthy’s seat in California’s 20th District is on May 21, and the only two candidates on the ballot are Republicans (they won California’s “top-two” primary in this heavily Republican district). So a Republican is guaranteed to win there, and once he’s sworn in, the House would have 218 Republicans and 214 Democrats — raising the number of resignations necessary to flip it by one more. In June, there will be two more special elections to fill vacancies in safely Republican districts — the seats of former Reps. Bill Johnson (R-OH) and Ken Buck (R-CO), so barring shocking results there, the House would be composed of 220 Republicans and 214 Democrats after that. So I’d put the chances of a surprise Democratic majority in the “extremely, extremely, extremely unlikely” range. The best shot for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to become speaker is the normal one — winning in November. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","There’s a lot to parse through and digest on Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter . The 27-track album is a rich, sprawling tribute to various eras and genres of Southern music, from outlaw country to Louisiana’s zydeco to 1960s rock ‘n’ roll — all of which have contributed to our collective understanding of country music. She carries out this hefty task with the help of some lesser- known country artists and some bona fide legends. One of those heavy hitters is none other than Dolly Parton, who makes several appearances, including in a playful audio message on Cowboy Carter’s ninth track. “ You know that hussy with the good hair you sing about ?” Parton asks Beyoncé, referencing her famous “Becky with the good hair” lyric on her 2016 song “Sorry.” “Reminded me of someone I knew back when, except she has flamin’ locks of auburn hair . Bless her heart. Just a hair of a different color, but it hurts just the same.” The next track is Beyoncé’s highly anticipated rendition of Parton’s 1973 smash hit “Jolene.” Beyoncé is one of many artists across generational and cultural lines to put their own twist on Parton’s heralded ditty. Her remake turns what was originally Parton’s plea to a red-haired bank clerk to stay away from her husband into a more aggressive (and funny) threat. “You don’t want this smoke, so shoot your shot with someone else,” she sings before reminding Jolene that she’s “still a banjee country bitch from Louisiana.” She also calls Jolene a “bird.” Beyoncé is no stranger to singing about infidelity, both as a former member of Destiny’s Child and as a solo artist. But her confessional 2016 album Lemonade was the first time she had not-so- subtly referenced cheating in her marriage with Jay-Z — at least in a way listeners could clock. On the album’s more memorable tracks like “Don’t Hurt Yourself” and “Sorry,” the singer embraces a kind of cathartic and arguably feminist rage before controversially offering her partner forgiveness. In that regard, it’s maybe not surprising that she reimagines “Jolene” as a feistier song, while remaining predictably confident in her own womanhood. Beyoncé’s “Jolene” remake also feels in line with a history of outspoken, scorned women in country music, addressing their men’s misdeeds in a fierce, violent, and often vengeful manner: from Loretta Lynn’s “Fist City” to Carrie Underwood’s “Before He Cheats” to Taylor Swift’s collaboration with Haim “No Body, No Crime.” (It’s the premise of many Miranda Lambert songs too.) Sometimes, the victim is the guy. Sometimes, it’s his “pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive.” To get to the bottom of this trend, I spoke to country music scholar Jocelyn Neal , a professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, about the role of infidelity in country music and what it says about the misunderstood and complex role of gender within the genre. Songs about infidelity aren’t unique to country music. But it feels like it has some significance in this genre because there’s a stereotypical image of Southern people as “traditional” and valuing monogamy. I don’t think it solely has to do with one particular demographic. The storytelling and songwriting tradition in country music has always embraced descriptions of real life for working- class people. The other part of it is that it has embraced describing those stories about people’s lives across different age categories — it doesn’t just focus on young people. So we have this long tradition in country music of songs that talk about relationships in very direct terms. Were these songs ever considered controversial? They have been. For instance, when Kitty Wells recorded “It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels,” which itself was a callback or rebuttal song, it was considered too explicit in its description of cheating to be acceptable, and there was some controversy about whether or not it could be performed. That was 1952. One of the time periods when this dialogue became more common, unsurprisingly, is the late 1960s and into the 1970s. If we look at larger shifts in the social environment in this country, that was a time period when second-wave feminism was really at the forefront. Laws were changing that affected how women could function economically . Laws about divorce changed during that time period. And there was a really large discussion about gender roles and constraints on women, specifically as it was affecting the working-class population. When I think about country songs about cheating, I automatically envision empowered, angry women setting things on fire and slashing tires — is that a common trope? What you’re referring to with those images is a later time period. And they were performed by artists — Carrie Underwood, Gretchen Wilson, and certainly Miranda Lambert — that were really speaking to a bit of a younger life profile. Those song lyrics are always somewhat reflective of the discourse at the time and what audience that music was being directed towards, which was slightly younger. There are also men singing these kinds of songs. And some of that goes all the way back to the earliest traditions that are drawing from old murder ballads from previous centuries. I’m talking about recordings from the 1920s and ’30s. That level of retaliation goes against the well-behaved, “Southern belle” image. But is that archetype really representative of most women in country? The kind of happy, domestically satisfied, good-girl image is something that deserves a lot more careful analysis because it’s only been put forward a couple of times in country music history. There’s a middle-class, feminine ideal that gets cultivated in the American public imagination of the 1950s, the June Cleaver kind of image. And working-class women have never really had that same match of identity. There’s Loretta Lynn songs like “You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man)” or “Fist City,” which are much more outspoken than the image we’re just talking about. That image gets advertised sometimes, but I don’t think it has ever fully captured the complexities of gender representation within country music. Beyonce’s “Jolene” certainly matches the energy of those Loretta Lynn songs. It’s literally a “don’t you dare.” I don’t think anybody is going to be really surprised that after 50 years of time passing from second-wave feminism to Beyoncé’s era, that she’s going to make that change. I was delighted to hear it. How unique was the perspective of the original “Jolene” then, when it first came out? One of the things that people have written about with “Jolene” is the level of detail that Parton is using to describe the other woman — her hair color, her eyes, her lips. There’s a man involved, and she wants the guy, and the guy wants the other woman, but the entire focus of the lyrics are on this very obsessive kind of womanly connection. But these female-to-female conversations exist in many time periods in country music. Tammy Wynette doesn’t get brought into these conversations because historians haven’t really granted her credit as one of these independent, feisty, forward-thinking women in her lyrics. But even she has songs that are woman-to-woman conversations — “If I were you, here’s what I would do,” and “Have you really thought this through?” etc. Well, Beyoncé ends “Jolene” singing that she’s going to “stand by her man.” Do we think she’s giving Tammy a shout-out there? You can’t deny that’s definitely a textual reference there. Where Tammy Wynette’s song “Stand By Your Man” was basically telling other women to stand by their men, Beyonce, at least, makes it two-sided: I’m standing by him, but he’s also going to stand by me.

"2","When you hear the word “chaplain,” you probably think of a priest or an Imam or some other kind of traditional clergyperson — that’s what springs to my mind in any case. Which is why I was surprised when I stumbled upon an article in the New York Times magazine from earlier this year about an “atheist chaplain” working on death row in an Oklahoma prison. The piece is about a convicted killer, Phillip Hancock, who didn’t believe in God but wanted a spiritual adviser with him as he approached his execution. The chaplain is a man named Devin Moss, who spent a year in daily conversation with Hancock and eventually traveled from Brooklyn to Oklahoma to be with him in his final hours. The whole notion of an atheist chaplain is interesting, of course, but even more interesting are the deeper questions here about what spiritual care looks like without religion and what it means to confront our death without God or a belief in the afterlife. I wouldn’t call myself a religious person, but I do take the spiritual life seriously and, whether you’re a believer or a non-believer, it seems important to understand what religion offers to people and what it would mean to offer something similar in a secular context. Which is why I invited Moss onto The Gray Area to talk about what being a humanist chaplain (he prefers that term over “atheist”) means to him and what his experience on death row taught him about religion and the universal struggle to face death with dignity. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. As always, there’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Stitcher , or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday. Sean Illing You did your residency as a chaplain at Bellevue Hospital in New York City during the pandemic. What was that like? Devin Moss It was intense and full of people in acute moments of crisis, at that hospital in particular. But I cannot imagine a better place to learn what it means to be spiritual. Because I came into this incredibly insecure about spirituality in general and what kind of spiritual care I can provide to people when I’m a non-theist. How can I do this without God? It was scary as hell and it was profound as hell at the same time. Sean Illing Were you a different person coming out of that? Devin Moss Absolutely. And even on a daily basis, my shift hours were from 2 to 8 or 9, and around 1 I’d be like, Ugh, I can’t believe I got to go back and do this today , but when I’d leave at night, I’d be like, Wow, I could never have imagined that would happen today, I learned so much! I felt like a different person leaving at night than when I got there in the morning and that was a repetitive cycle over and over again. Sean Illing We’re talking because I happened upon this article about your experience on death row. I guess I’m curious how you found yourself there in the first place. How does a humanist chaplain from Brooklyn end up on death row in Oklahoma? Devin Moss Soon after I finished my residency at Bellevue, the American Humanist Association sent me an email saying that there are some attorneys that represent this man on death row named Phillip Hancock in Oklahoma, and he’s looking for a non-theist chaplain and they wanted to know if I was interested. I said I was absolutely interested. And on reflection, to be candid, I felt called to do that from a spiritual care perspective, but I also was very much intrigued by the story. So I wrote Phil a letter, introduced myself, left my phone number in it and said, If you find that I am the right person to represent you or be by your side in such a important time, I would love to do so, and then we talked and hit it off and started a journey of almost a year. “How a culture dies is a direct reflection of how they live and we do not die well in modern America” Sean Illing Did you have strong feelings about the death penalty before you went to Oklahoma? Did the experience change your views one way or the other? Devin Moss I did not have strong opinions. I’d describe my views going in this way: If there was a chance for anybody innocent to be executed, then I’m not for it. And yet, knowing that there are monsters among us, I still had this hypothetical scenario in my head, and it’s the one that everybody who’s pro- capital punishment will use: If it was your daughter (and it’s always the daughter, no one says if it were your son), and she was murdered and raped, that should be the litmus test of how we think of capital punishment. That’s the argument that the state legislators in Oklahoma use and I don’t know where I got it, but that was also in my head prior to working with Phil. And in the case of such a heinous violent crime, then yeah, I would be okay with capital punishment. That’s how I came into it. Those are real feelings. If a parent had to go through that horrible, horrible scenario, they have every right to feel that. And I’m not advocating that anybody can’t feel those very strong and real emotions but what I didn’t realize until I was actually in the soup is that there are a lot of externalities. The ripples of who it affects, they’re significant. The legislators make the laws, the judicial branch of the state does the sentencing, but guess who does the executions? None of them are doing the executions, none of the family of the victims are doing the executions, it is everyday people. It’s people like me, it is the corrections officers in the small towns where this is more than likely the only employment opportunity they have and we are the ones that are doing this. I spoke with a man named Adam Luck, who was the former chair of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board before the execution, and he said, Everybody that has a hand in doing the execution itself, part of them dies in some way. Although that sounds like a dramatic statement, it’s absolutely 100 percent true. The warden isn’t for it, the corrections officers aren’t for it, and so with all of the externalities and all the pain, it creates a karmic ripple that is multigenerational. Sean Illing The last words Phillip heard were yours — what did you say? Devin Moss The whole thing was surreal. The whole day was surreal. Even that morning, the morning of the execution, the governor still hadn’t made a decision whether to grant clemency. The execution was scheduled for 10 am, so it was postponed an hour and a half and Phil is strapped to the gurney for an extra hour-plus, which is horrible to think about. And the night before, they messed up his last meal, I can’t even express to this day how angry that makes me and I can imagine what it does to the spirit of someone that just cannot get any demonstration of humanity on any level. Normally, the spiritual care adviser generally gets 30 to 45 minutes with the person that’s going to be executed, but because the governor had delayed, the press corps had already made it through security, and I was just trying to maintain my poise and not get frazzled. And we went through this maze where the head chaplain then left me in this sally port and the corrections officers escorted me up to the front door of the execution chamber. It was there that the masked corrections officer who would be in the room with us greeted me because the corrections officers that are in the room need to be anonymous. And then I could see in his face that he was nervous and that he was scared and that he was also affected by this moment. It was in that moment that I realized that part of my role is just to bring as much calmness and peace into that space as I possibly could. Earlier that morning, I had written an invocation, a prayer of sorts, that I knew needed to be said and I did it immediately because I wanted to claim that space for Phil so that we could make it sacred and not let any time go by without making sure that he felt that this was his time. Sean Illing Do you remember the prayer that you wrote? Devin Moss When I originally wrote it, I wrote something about “I call into the space the spirit of the divine” and then I crossed that out and instead I just wrote “I call into the space the spirit of our humanity” because it was very clear to me that this was a human problem and not a theological issue. And I had the answer to the Philippians riddle, Show me something real, tell me something true . I seeded that within the prayer, I wanted him to know that he was loved and that I was a conduit to that love and that he was not alone. And then I also invoked the spirit of grace, of strength, of surrender, and, interestingly, I ended it with an amen just because it felt right. I also understood too that there were other people in that room, besides Phil and I, that I think needed to hear these words and so I claimed that space for him. And then I followed it up with telling him how our relationship affected me and what it meant to me and that he is a loved human. He died well, with grace. I made sure that he knew that he was loved and he was not alone. And so, in this weird moment of an execution, which is weird to say, there was peace. Sean Illing Part of what interests me about your story is this question about whether we need religion, or something like religion. The fact that you felt called to do this work speaks to this. Do you feel like there’s a God- shaped hole in the modern world that needs to be filled by something even if that’s something isn’t supernaturalism or religion in a conventional sense? Devin Moss I do believe that. I do believe that there is a God-shaped hole in all of us and I do not feel that it needs to be filled with dogma. The question that I get asked a lot in this regard is, “How do you prepare someone who’s dying, who doesn’t believe that there’s something next?” The answer is in the reframing of the question. If there is something next and if that’s what you believe, fine. And if we’re wrong, then great. But what’s more important is everything that you’re doing before that moment — that’s the most important, not after. What happens after is after, but it’s the transition that’s important and how you get there and all these micro-steps tracking back throughout your life. So do we need spirituality as individuals? Yes, I think so. And I would also say, as a culture, whether it’s a collective consciousness or a resonance that connects us to each other and connects us out to something bigger, there’s something real there and we need to make sure those points are connected. Sean Illing I’ve really come to be annoyed with a certain kind of atheist that can only approach religion as a set of epistemological claims, as though scanning the Bible for bogus claims about biology or history will amount to some death blow for religion. And I understand where that comes from. This has always been tricky for me because I do think religion has done immense damage in the world. I think it has caused a lot of needless suffering in the world. I think it still causes a lot of needless suffering in the world. There are people in this country who want to create a theocracy here, who want to chain women to their reproductive cycles because of their religious beliefs, and those people are enemies of liberal democracy in my opinion. It’s important to say all of that. But it’s also important to recognize that religion, at its best, is a near-universal expression of this human need for connection and ritual and meaning and it’s a mistake to not grapple seriously with the implications of that, especially if you’re a non-believer. Devin Moss I see spirituality and theology as two completely different animals. I see religion as an expression of the spiritualities. Because the way it works now is that spirituality is an expression of religion, but I say flip it. I’m a huge proponent of rites of passage rituals, I’m a huge proponent of even making rituals throughout your day and you can develop them for yourself, you can be as syncretic as you need to be just to make sure that it is bringing intention throughout your day. The expression of spirituality can be your lived religion and we can see what that looks like. Even if it’s Sunday mornings, we’re going to sweep up the sidewalks in Brooklyn and have coffee and cake, that’s an important spiritual expression and can be considered religion without the pomp and the history and all of those things. Sean Illing A humanist chaplain may not be able to offer the solace that comes with belief in the afterlife, but what kind of solace can you offer someone as they approach the end? Devin Moss Death is hard for everybody and it’s hard because we avoid it personally and we most definitely avoid it as a culture. How a culture dies is a direct reflection of how they live and we do not die well in modern America. I would probably take out the border between faith and non-faith when it comes to how to die well and I would just say that dying well requires work that is to be done while you’re still very much alive, whether you have faith in a supernatural power or not.

"1","The reversal last week by NBC News of its decision to hire former Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel as a political analyst took Republicans by surprise. However, in the wake of McDaniel’s firing, MSNBC host and Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for the network Chris Hayes placed a job ad on Monster.com that suggests NBC’s efforts may continue to fall short of Republican expectations. It is reproduced below: NBC seeks to hire a Republican political analyst to comment on NBC and MSNBC News programming and to fetch Chief Political Analyst Chuck Todd’s favorite scones every Sunday morning. Our news divisions welcome any Republican applicant who fits the criteria described below. Any Republican who worked and/or voted for Donald Trump or watched The Apprentice and enjoyed it need not apply. NBC hires regardless of race, color, or sexual orientation and will adhere to its DEI recruiting standards. Still, we’re realistic and understand the ideal Republican candidate likely will be stereotypically white, chubby, and awkward (think Karl Rove or Sarah Huckabee Sanders minus the crazy). NBC also hires regardless of religious creed, although the preferred candidate should be an avowed Catholic who hates Catholicism or whose piousness promotes progressivism (think David French of The New York Times ). Even though we don’t count them under our DEI standards, Jewish Republicans who loathe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and accuse Israel of genocide are welcome to apply. The GOP commentator must hold the core conservative values of supporting abortion, mass amnesty, Keynesian economics, collectivism, high taxes, and men competing in women’s sports. A hatred of oil, coal, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is required. To discuss how Republicans can win elections, the candidate should have recently lost political office, been a part of a losing campaign, or been fired from or formerly led a failing Republican political organization (except for Ronna “Romney” McDaniel — oh, the horror). Having worked for former presidential candidates John McCain and/or Mitt Romney is preferred but not required. NBC has desperately tried hiring Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. However, CNN scooped up Kinzinger, and Cheney still hasn’t forgiven Lawrence O’Donnell for dressing up as her for NBC’s 2019 Halloween costume party. The GOP candidate should be able to denigrate former Presidents George W. Bush and (especially) Trump while just as quickly praising President Joe Biden’s domestic and foreign policy achievements, such as securing America’s southern border from Texans seeking to protect it. The candidate also should support Biden’s effort to ensure Israel does not defeat Hamas in a way that would jeopardize Michigan’s electoral votes. The applicant must, with a straight face, be able to call Trump a vicious antisemite while simultaneously sitting on the same set with the Rev. Al Sharpton. The candidate must accept being subjugated and despised by most NBC/MSNBC staffers (e.g., mindlessly agreeing with Joy Reid over whoever or whatever she says is racist that day, being available 24/7 to clean Joe Scarborough’s smart-people glasses, sweeping up Jen Psaki’s skin after she sheds it). Qualified GOP candidates should view working for NBC News the same way the Loyalists viewed working for the British Empire during the American Revolution because that is how seditious Republicans will view them. Ignoring reality is essential at NBC News. Biden’s rapidly declining mental faculties will require the applicant to dismiss concerns about it as ageism or that it’s perfectly normal for all mentally spry octogenarians to repeatedly fall down Air Force One’s stairs. Similarly, the analyst must believe that a man can become a woman and vice-versa, and to suggest otherwise is hateful and defies logic and science. The Republican candidate must label anyone who even slightly questions the 2020 election result as a fascistic election denier. Similarly, the candidate also must solemnly observe January 6, 2021, as a day worse than September 11, the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and JFK’s assassination combined. Common phrases expected to be spoken around the office include: “Democracy is in danger,” “What would Barack do?” and “Lock up the gin, Chris Matthews is here.” Handling unpredictability during the 2024 Presidential Election cycle is critical. For instance, the Republican analyst must declare that Donald Trump would be the most dangerous man ever elected president. However, should Trump somehow not be the nominee and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis be the candidate, then the analyst must aver that DeSantis would be even worse than Trump if elected. Qualities NBC News does not seek: Sanctimony. Nicolle Wallace won’t allow its transmission over NBC News’s sacred airways. Lying also won’t be tolerated. The candidate will have his/her comments preapproved by Rachel Maddow to ensure they align with the truth. Educational requirements: a bachelor’s degree from an Ivy League university. A law degree is preferred, mainly if the candidate’s mentors include Laurence Tribe, J. Michael Luttig, or Letitia James. Proof of having received at least 10 Covid-19 vaccinations is required. At least three references, all of whom must be registered Democrats or members of the Lincoln Project, should be submitted to Mika Brzezinski, who really wants NBC News to hire a conservative Republican.

"1","W hen Jesus, anguished at his incoming ordeal, walked up the mountain to pray, he wanted one thing: for his friends to sit with him. He wanted them to be with him. No one, save God Himself, could take Jesus’ suffering away but someone could have removed the isolation of his suffering. For those who don’t know the story, Jesus’ friends couldn’t do that. They were exhausted and fell asleep. Jesus, in addition to being distraught, was alone. In contrast, when Jesus was dying on the cross, he wasn’t alone. His mother Mary, his friend John, and his friend Mary Magdalene stood by him and stayed with him, at great risk to their own lives and at great personal emotional cost. Mary, especially, knew that her son was born for adversity and knew what was coming and she did not leave her son’s side. She stayed with him. (LISTEN to Melissa Mackenzie and Scott McKay: The Spectacle Ep. 86: Pearl Davis Is Wrong About Mary ) It is Easter season and Christians around the world are focusing on their own sin and the grace of Jesus Christ who died for them. Christians contemplate the suffering inherent in this earthly life and consider bearing their burdens and offering up their own pain in service and with Jesus Christ. Their faith imbues their grief and loss and hurt with meaning. Mary and John and Mary Magdalene’s choice to be with their son and friend during his suffering and death is also worth paying attention to. Humans are social mammals and need a pack, a team. They need family. Humans need support and care and community. Human suffering is lessoned by social bonds. Jesus was comforted by the presence of his mother and two best friends. Jesus did not die alone. His last words were to his friend John asking that he take care of his mother. Jesus needed the comfort that his mom would be okay after he died. John gave this to him. When someone is enduring pain and loss or a hospital stay or a jail stint or a family death, friends and family wonder what they can do to help. Often, the answer is as simple as just being with them. Sometimes, like in the case of Jesus’ praying, the friends or family don’t even need to talk. They just need to be awake and present. There’s a study about women giving birth — something that a woman must do alone — that notes better outcomes with a doula in the room. A doula is a birth assistant. The interesting part of the study is that the woman doesn’t even have to be actively doing anything. She doesn’t need to bring a cool wash cloth or ice chips. She doesn’t need to massage the mom’s back or give her soothing words. If the doula sits in the corner and reads a book, her presence is enough to make for fewer interventions and better outcomes for both mother and child. The woman isn’t alone in her pain. Whether consciously or not, someone being there lightens the load for her. In this individualized, mobile, and digitized society, too little attention is paid to social bonds and the need for them. People are more productive in the workplace when they report having a friend at work. People who are part of a church community live longer. Men who are married live longer, make more money, and have more sex. Successful people report that their most important decision of their lives was their choice to get married. (LISTEN: The Spectacle Ep. 85: Wokeism Is a Cult. The Answer Is Faith: A Conversation With Carrie Sheffield. ) The deprived people are those without family, church, and community bonds. It leads young people, especially, to turn to mobs and gangs and violence to find belonging and meaning. No one can navigate this world alone — not even Jesus. He needed his mother. He needed his best friends. He needed his students and work. He needed support and community. Loneliness, more than smoking or drinking , shortens lifespan. Seeking community, then, is critical. Some though, cannot seek community and must be sought. Through isolation or disease or simply age and immobility, our aging population is lonely. There is an epidemic of lonely people. Mary, Jesus’ mom, set an example for Christians . Even at great personal cost and seeing her son tortured and crucified, she stayed with him until the end. She refused to leave her son alone. To be human is to suffer. It takes amazingly little to make it bearable. A loving presence makes all the difference."
"1","F or two weeks, in my Humanities course at Thales College, we will be reading most of Tocqueville’s Democracy in America , an unsurpassed analysis of the American system of government and the American character. That character, as Tocqueville saw, had been molded in large part by the religion and the manners of the English Puritans who settled in New England, for they were the ones and not the leisured men of the south who would dominate the nation as her boundaries extended ever westward. Aside from religion and manners, one might think that Tocqueville would credit the structure of the national government — most obviously manifest in the Constitution — with American success and growth in population, territory, military strength, and industry. That would be, I think, to mistake the machine for those who run it and for the material it is supposed to act upon. The Constitution worked, at least for a time, for Americans and their situation, and Tocqueville is careful to note that a structure fit for them would not be fit for other peoples in other places. We Americans, with our often impractical pragmatism, have long attempted to apply American machinery to non-American material, as if you could build arches as well out of sand as out of stone, or make glass as well out of stone as out of sand. (READ MORE from Anthony Esolen: True Theory Can Save Us From the Left’s Pseudo-Theories ) Woodrow Wilson was in this regard our most impractical president, a democratic theorist with little of the spirit or the touch of the common man. In the name of democracy he carved up the old Austrian empire into ethnic nations and set the stage for the most destructive war ever to plague the earth. We will be discussing the machinery of the Constitution and the mutual relations of those bodies of government that made up the United States, and I have advised my students to turn their minds to the passion for equality that, for good and ill, is the most powerful social force in a democratic republic. But today we did not broach that subject. Today we looked at something so obvious and so important that only a theorist with a doctorate in political science could miss it. It was geography. Tocqueville spends a lot of time describing for his European readers what the American land north of Mexico is like. And here I found my students most immediately curious and eager to learn more. I know that geography is ignored in our schools, having been folded along with history into the amorphous “social studies.” But geography takes you immediately into the stuff of life, what no theorist can understand in abstraction. I asked the students what Tocqueville noted about the Appalachian Mountains. What are they like? What obstacle did they pose to westward settlement? For the Appalachians are not like the Alps. They are not like the Pyrenees, that in the Middle Ages posed a barrier between Muslim- checkered Spain and Christian France. They are mostly old mountains with rounded tops, many easy passes, and, as Tocqueville notes, rich valleys running in their midst, especially the one we call the Great Valley, extending from southwestern Virginia all the way through Maryland and Pennsylvania to the Delaware River. And beyond the Appalachians, what do we have? The students thought about it for a while. “The big rivers,” they said. “The Great Plains.” Those too are among the things that Tocqueville discusses. The Mississippi is navigable from its mouth for 2,000 miles into Minnesota. Its most water- abundant tributary, the Ohio, is navigable along its entire length, from its mouth at the Mississippi all the way to the place Tocqueville calls by its old name, Duquesne (Pittsburgh). Other tributaries of the Mississippi, such as the Missouri, the Arkansas, the Tennessee, and the Red, are navigable for long stretches; and then canals and railroads would connect one great water system with another (for example, the Baltimore and Ohio), so that logs cut in Minnesota could be sent practically anywhere, with expedition and with little or no overland hauling. Meanwhile, that vast land between the Appalachians in the east and the Rockies in the west contains some of the richest farm soil in the world, far richer than the flinty granite-land of New Hampshire or the thin sands of Connecticut. How did that soil get there? I talked a little about the retreat of the glaciers when the Ice Age passed, and the silt they deposited in their wake, as they scooped out the Great Lakes, leveled the lands, and spilled their waters into what would become the world’s greatest and most convenient system of rivers. Such soil, I said, extends from the Great Plains north and west to the mouth of the Mackenzie, and it is only the shortness of the growing season, not the characteristics of the soil, that prevents Canadians from growing wheat and barley all the way to the Arctic Ocean. (READ MORE: Freedom as License Is Slavery in Disguise ) So there was gold in them thar plains, the gold of great farmland. Americans had the knowledge and the tools to turn it into a breadbasket for the nation and, later, for the world. But the region was already inhabited by native tribes. What then? I asked my students what you needed, before steam and combustion engines, to undertake agriculture on a large scale. They answered readily, “You need big strong animals to pull a plow.” The next question was obvious. “What big strong animal did the natives in this area of the world have that could do that?” Here biology and geography and history come together. “They didn’t have the horse,” my students said, not till Europeans introduced it, and then the Indians mainly used the horse for warfare. What about oxen? “They had the bison,” said one of my students, and in fact, as Tocqueville says, the lives of the Indians in the American plains were bound by the habits and the movements of the great herds that thundered over the land. Couldn’t the bison have been used to drag a plow? There they were rightly skeptical. The bison is strong enough to do that — too strong, though, too big, and too ornery to be domesticated. And then there was another factor missing. How did men in the old world domesticate great herds of sheep? What did they have that was not native to the lands between the Appalachians and the Rockies? “Dogs,” said the students, brightening, because we Americans all love man’s best friend. “They didn’t have dogs.” So you had the conflict of one people with all their tools, their means of communication, their settled self-government, their draught animals, their sophisticated weapons, and their dogs, with people who lived off the land but not from it, whose fortunes were tied to the herds of bison that retreated ahead of the European settlers, so that they must retreat with them, and, as the Psalmist says, their place would know them no more. It is to Tocqueville’s immense credit that he takes no delight in this prospect, nor does he sentimentalize the Indian as the superior and noble savage. He recognizes and honors the Indian’s courage, aristocratic reserve, and proud hospitality; and he recognizes and deplores his savagery, his ignorance, and his aloof refusal to learn anything from the peoples who are displacing him. He notes the treachery of state governments that break treaties almost as soon as the national government makes them; he has compassion for the wretchedness to which the Indians are often reduced; and yet he does not suppose for a moment that there is a clear solution to the problem. For the land is there, and to farm it can feed a thousand for every one person it fed before, and the settlers have the means and the will to do it, and what must be, shall be. (READ MORE: Ignorance to the Fourth Degree ) It will be interesting to hear what my students have to say about equality as we go forward, and the Constitution, and whether the federated form of American government that characterized Tocqueville’s time is still with us in reality, as it is in name. But I think I will not set aside this interest in the land, the water, the stuff of life. And I wish our schools would take the hint."
"1","WASHINGTON — When Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., announced on the Capitol steps Friday that she would file a motion to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, a throng of Hill reporters leaned in. MTG, as she is known, essentially is crack for cable news biggies. She validates the sneering class’s poor opinion of conservatives. So of course she’s on TV news with amazing regularity. The best part: That Friday scrum could be replayed all weekend and into Monday. And it was. (READ MORE from Debra J. Saunders: The ‘Biden Lift’ or Influence Peddling? ) Johnson may be House Republicans’ speaker, at least for the moment, but Greene is Big Media’s choice for leadership. Forget former Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel; Greene should be a paid talent on NBC. Chuck Todd probably would approve because he would have more opportunities to disapprove. The situation must be demoralizing for veteran GOP lawmakers, who came to Washington to write laws and make government work better, only to watch the trolls capture the spotlight. The MTGs of D.C. have sold GOP voters on the notion that real conservatives don’t cut deals — even though cutting deals is what Congress is supposed to do. Need I point out that former President Donald Trump’s big book was called “The Art of the Deal”? Now “deal” is a dirty word. Greene told the press that she wanted to “find a new speaker of the House that will stand with Republicans and our Republican majority instead of standing with the Democrats.” Standing with Democrats? Yes, Johnson did oversee the passage of a spending bill that then was passed by the Democratic Senate and signed by President Joe Biden. The alternative would be another government shutdown — which inevitably would be followed by capitulation because most voters don’t elect members to shut down everything. As it is, the $1.2 trillion package Biden just signed slashed funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, with its alleged ties to Hamas. That’s a victory. And it allocated more money for border and immigration enforcement. Win-win. While Greene searches for a new fearless leader on camera, other Republicans are bailing. Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., served his last day Friday — after calling the House dysfunctional. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., announced he is bailing on April 19. When the four-term military veteran is gone, the GOP’s House majority will be down to one tenuous vote. The more the likes of MTG crow about their purity, the more they drive the adults to the other side of the aisle. Gallagher announced his retirement after he refused to vote to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas — another showy, meaningless exercise. I understand the exodus. Gallagher has an impressive combat record. He deployed twice to Iraq. He’s a counterintelligence pro. His training doesn’t make him right about everything — but it makes him the sort of figure you want to see on Capitol Hill. And he’s leaving before his term is up. (READ MORE: USA IOU.

"1","“W e are an Easter people, and alleluia is our song,” the great St. Augustine once wrote. Over 1,500 years later, Pope St. John Paul II echoed these words when speaking in Adelaide, Australia. “We do not pretend that life is all beauty. We are aware of darkness and sin, of poverty and pain,” the Pontiff said. “But we know Jesus has conquered sin and passed through his own pain to the glory of the Resurrection. And we live in the light of his Paschal Mystery — the mystery of his Death and Resurrection. ‘We are an Easter People and Alleluia is our song!’” Those words were spoken nearly four decades ago. Since then, the world has changed much. Yes, the Iron Curtain fell, the horrors of the World Wars are now distant specters, but new horrors have risen in their stead. The apathetic nihilism of the 1920s and 30s and the rampant materialism of the 80s have given way to sheer hedonism, the Christian identity of the West is openly challenged and aggressively suppressed, and godless ideology has formed an unholy union with science and technology, unbounded by any moral standard or obligation beyond the felt emotion of any given moment. In America, the slaughter of the unborn and the mutilating of children have become religious principles — practically sacraments — for a domineering political faction. Legacy media spews lies and vitriol to a population largely stripped of critical thinking — thanks in no small part to that political faction’s gutting of the nation’s public education system. Election integrity concerns have left citizens worried that they may be disenfranchised, ruled over by an elite political class wed to an oligarchy of technocrats. (READ MORE from S.A. McCarthy: American Catholics Back Trump Over Biden ) Crime is on the rise, violence is becoming commonplace on the streets and subway platforms. Illegal immigration has reached a fever pitch, with fighting-age males from (let’s just say it) uncivilized countries swarming across our borders, replacing the heritage population. And the few men and women who take a stand for the very principles for which our forefathers fought, bled, and died are smeared as extremists and threats to democracy. This is deeply disheartening, and yet news of the decay of our nation is practically unavoidable. Those who could once make a claim that they just want to be left alone have found that the tyranny of the Left will not leave them alone but will invade every corner of culture, society, education, media, medicine, law, leaving nothing untouched or undefiled. What can men do in the face of such reckless destruction? What response is there against the merciless brutalization of the West, of the nations that we call home, the nations that our forefathers called home? The Saints answer this question for us readily: hope. It is in Easter that we find our hope, in the resurrected Christ. It is on Christ’s back — His beaten and flogged back, saddled with a cross, with the weight of the world’s sins — that civilization rests. It is in God-made-man that we must place our hope: not in imperfect ideologies and captive institutions, not in political leaders and cults of personality, not even in our homelands and sovereign nations, but in He who is Sovereign over all. No matter the crises we face today, Christ’s crucifixion (commemorated on Good Friday) was the bleakest, grimmest hour in human history: the death of God Himself. Yet through His glorious resurrection, He restored to us life. What profound joy must set fire and blaze within our hearts to know that our hope is in One who has conquered the grave. The tomb could not contain Him, death itself trembled and fell before Him. As St. Paul the Apostle rejoices, “Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?” (1 Corinthians 15:55). But what good is hope in the face of what seems almost certain (slow and hard-fought, to be sure, but certain nonetheless) defeat? St. Augustine tells us, “Hope has two beautiful daughters; their names are Anger and Courage. Anger at the way things are, and Courage to see that they do not remain as they are.” Even a cursory glance at the horrors our modern age has wrought is enough to inspire the most righteous and violent fury. Tales of children surviving abortions and being left to die, stories of children being drugged and carved up to produce synthetic opposite-sex sex organs, testimony from survivors of sex-trafficking condemning the ever-prevalent phenomenon of internet pornography — these and hundreds and thousands of other depravities are more than enough to rouse anger in the hearts of those who still have hearts. Anger then sees to it that we want a change, that we do not want our culture to be thus corroded. Courage gives us the strength to follow through on our anger, to bring down our foe and rebuild the West. The great author G.K. Chesterton, himself numbered among the Easter people, once wrote, “Courage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die.” He continued: He that will lose his life, the same shall save it,” is not a piece of mysticism for saints and heroes. It is a piece of everyday advice for sailors or mountaineers. It might be printed in an Alpine guide or a drill book. This paradox is the whole principle of courage; even of quite earthly or brutal courage. A man cut off by the sea may save his life if we will risk it on the precipice. He can only get away from death by continually stepping within an inch of it. A soldier surrounded by enemies, if he is to cut his way out, needs to combine a strong desire for living with a strange carelessness about dying. He must not merely cling to life, for then he will be a coward, and will not escape. He must not merely wait for death, for then he will be a suicide, and will not escape. He must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it; he must desire life like water and yet drink death like wine. And it is, of course, our hope in Christ that inspires us to be courageous. When standing up for what is right and true and moral and virtuous, we may ask ourselves, “But what if I die?” More likely we will ask ourselves, “What if I get canceled? What if I get doxed? What if I lose my job? What if I lose my friends?” With our hope founded firmly upon Christ’s resurrection, we may boldly answer, “So what? Every man must die some day, why not today? If I am not canceled for saying this, I’ll just be canceled for saying something else further down the road, so why not say it?” (READ MORE: Polish Bishops’ Fight Leftist Government Onslaught) For Christ’s death and resurrection make manifest one inescapable, incontrovertible fact: Hell has already lost the war. There are battles still to be won, and more still to be fought, but the war itself is won, and the risen Christ is the victor. Let us then place our hope in Him and, with righteous anger and paradoxical courage in our hearts, proclaim that we are an Easter people, and alleluia is our song!"
"1","I n 1994, our family took its first international trip, going to visit family on both sides who lived in England. We were met at the airport by my wife’s older cousin, Johnny, who was a successful London architect. Much of my wife’s extended family, including Johnny, were able to escape Nazi Germany. Johnny’s mother had gone to the Berlin airport in the late Thirties with her children and boldly boarded a flight to London with no papers, persuading them that her family’s lives were at stake — and amazingly, they were let on board and into England. Many others were not so fortunate. Britain did well by Johnny’s family and he in turn did well by Britain, gracing London and other towns with his buildings. (READ MORE from Shmuel Klatzkin: RIP Joe Lieberman: A Man of Principle in an Unprincipled World ) On our visit, we stayed with Johnny in the Mill Hill area of London and went with him to his synagogue — which he had designed — on the Sabbath. As we approached the building, I was dismayed to see a security force there. It was a jarring breach of the peaceful Sabbath state of mind to me. I found out it was routine for synagogues in England. Not well publicized, but real — even before September 11 changed the atmosphere, the threat of violence was real enough in England. Thank God, I thought, I live in America, where antisemitism has been relegated to a powerless fringe. In the next decade, I spent a few years making occasional working trips to Asia, facilitating kosher certification of food producers who wished to gain entrance to the kosher market. When I would spend the Sabbath with a host in Manila or in Singapore, I had to come the day prior, bring my passport, and register at the armed guard’s booth to secure entrance to the synagogue the next day. Everyone had to be vetted before being allowed entrance. I twice spent Shabbat in Mumbai. The first time, there was no such requirement. The second time I went, only a few months later, the rabbi and his wife had been tortured and murdered by Pakistani terrorists, the rabbi’s home was temporarily closed, its walls pockmarked by bullets, and the old synagogue had a sandbagged position manned by a squad of soldiers guarding the entranceway. It is many years now since my place of worship in good old middle-America Dayton found it prudent to hire armed security for our public events. Eventually, we put up fencing, lighting, and security cameras all around. Our synagogue has a defense committee and some members carrying a concealed weapon. We let the police know who is carrying, so police will know if there ever is an incident and not target them. Our community has taken that in stride. When you stand strong against the hateful actors in the world, of which there are many, discipline is demanded and the willingness to see the fight through. What we have no intention of taking in stride is the growing acceptance of hatred of Jews, variously tolerated and encouraged by those who once were considered mainstream, guardians of our culture and its institutions of education and government. This is no small change in America. It is repudiation of the best in our history, our pioneering of freedom and our willingness to uproot hatred no matter how long the struggle, to establish equal justice under the law and equal opportunity to pursue happiness in a peaceful, civil society. The crucible of World War II purified this country. As a society, we stopped tolerating hatred, and with a national effort, we confined it to the fringes. The generation that spilled their blood and treasure to expunge Nazism would fight and succeed in uprooting Jim Crow. Antisemitism was no longer welcome in the mainstream. But now, it is being welcomed back to the mainstream. Though there are right wing antisemites, as was evident on January 6, they are still on the fringes there. Today, it is the Democrats taking the lead, disgracing the memory of people like Harry Truman, JFK, Hubert Humphrey, and Skip Jackson — and now, Joe Lieberman, of blessed memory. Our government spouts Hamas lies, lies that it knows are lies, to persuade Americans that Israel ought to give those poor Hamas guys the same kind of second chance that we blue states routinely afford to those such as the killer of Laterria Smith’s son, the good folks pushing people onto the subway tracks in NYC, and the guy who was just turned loose in the Big Apple after randomly slamming a woman in the face and breaking her jaw. What’s a wired jaw between friends? Don’t traumatize the jawbreaker. Alvin Bragg’s got more important things to do, saving the country from having a choice for president. (READ MORE: Biden’s Cowardice Feeds Hamas’ Criminal War Strategy ) No doubt all these folks — the subway shover, the jaw breaker, the murderer — are very misunderstood and the victims of — maybe Jews? (Not yet there, but given the trajectory — naw, such things could never happen. Just look at history.) But really, it’s just a little too much, you Jews and Israel. Stop it with the Hamas Hamas Hamas . What’s a little bit of murder, organized rape, beheadings, infanticide, corpse desecration, kidnapping? You’re overly sensitive, not properly deferential to the superior intersectional qualities of the ones you deem your enemies (the word is so — uncomfortable ). We Dems are using our control over the message now to counter your truths with our narrative (“truth” is such a colonialist concept). They’re in hot pursuit of something exhilarating, and their thought leaders know where it lies. One of the many left stars in Academia identified it memorably. The Cornell scholar said of the Hamas orgy of rape and murder, “It was exhilarating. It was energizing.” Thousands of rockets showered indiscriminately on Israel year after year just didn’t cut it anymore. Boring! Mass rape, dead babies, spitting on corpses being driven in pick-ups through cheering crowds, sex with dead women — there’s excitement! Anything as good as that on Net porn? Let’s get that exhilaration into our voters. Well, got to energize an electorate. It may take more Adderall than an octogenarian body could take for Grandpa Joe to mass-produce his angry-old-man SOTU routine for the stump. Violence seems to work great against an easily identifiable enemy who has done just a little too well to have sympathy. And hey, we might be able to go around the curve and siphon off a few of those antediluvian Jew-haters of the Right who never could get past Trump having Jewish grandchildren. So run my toxic musings. Societal decay and antisemitism have gone hand in hand for centuries. Someone must be to blame. And when truth becomes an unwanted guest and sophistry is lionized, when debate becomes unwelcome and people fearful to say what they think, the leaders of the rot will look for someone to blame, to keep the power they misuse firm in their hands. Is it any surprise that they come back to that old standby that has been turned to by tyrants from Torquemada to the Czars to Hitler? There is one good thing left us — we have a say still in just how well they will succeed. Let us use the power we still have left in the best way we can. (READ MORE: Biden Policy Divides at Home and in Israel ) Let’s use it wisely and well. The Divine Providence whose hand Washington continuously saw as he established American independence is waiting for us to take up its mighty cause."
"1","T he Western is one of America’s unique cultural gifts and no one personified that genre better than John Wayne — not Gary Cooper, not Clint Eastwood. In a career that spanned four decades, Wayne, with the considerable help of directors like John Ford and Howard Hawks, cemented the Western’s hold on the American psyche. Many of his Western films are regarded as classics: Stagecoach , Ford’s Cavalry trilogy , Fort Apache , She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, Rio Grande and of course, The Searchers , arguably the greatest Western ever made. A case can be made that another film, Hondo (1953) constitutes a neglected Wayne masterpiece, on a par with his best cowboy films. Having just finished another underrated film, Island in the Sky , directed by William Wellman, which was well received and made a profit, Wayne decided to return to his forte, the Western. He had come across a short story in Colliers, “The Gift of Cochise,” by Western author, Louis L’Amour, who was just beginning to establish his reputation as one of the best tellers of Western tales. (READ MORE: Cancel John Wayne? That’ll Be the Day ) The story appealed to Wayne. It was another tale of a relationship between a loner who comes to the aid of a pioneer woman, played by Broadway actress Geraldine Page, in a complex struggle with the Apache. The heroine was as much a major character and as fully developed as the hero. The Apache, and their chief, Vittorio, were portrayed more positively than was typical of the cowboy films of that time. Wayne may have been attracted to the story because it gave him an opportunity to show the native American not as a villain but in more complex terms. He had made a stab at that in the last of Ford’s Cavalry trilogy, She Wore A Yellow Ribbon . Vittorio’s anger at the white settlers was justified. They had killed his sons and had betrayed the Apache again and again. Wayne has a line late in the film where he points out that the Apache have no word for lie, telling Page that the Apache life was a good one. Wayne later said that he was proud of the way the Apache were portrayed in Hondo . “My Indian in Hondo ,” he later said, “was a great guy.” He preferred to believe that “the Indians know that I have a great deal of respect for them.” Neither Ford nor Hawks was available at the time so John Farrow, a more traditional director, was signed up to direct the picture. It didn’t matter to Wayne as one of his favorite script writers, James Edward Grant, was hired to do the screenplay. He had written Angel and the Badman (1947), one of Wayne’s favorite films and Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) which earned Wayne his first Academy Award nomination. The film that emerged also owed a great debt to Grant’s revision of L’Amour’s story and the camera work of Robert Burks, who would go on to film two of Alfred Hitchcock’s better films of the 1950s: Vertigo and Rear Window. The cast for Hondo was less spectacular than that for the Westerns he did with Ford. A few of the Ford-Wayne company were added: Ward Bond as a fellow scout and a young James Arness, a few years before his breakthrough with the television series, Gunsmoke . The key part of the Apache chief, Vittorio was played by the Australian actor, Michael Pate. Pate would specialize in Indian parts for the next decade, including a reprisal of Vittorio in the television series Hondo. His leading lady Geraldine Page was coming off a Drama Desk Award for her role in Tennessee Williams’ play Summer and Smoke . Her choice was considered odd. She had not appeared in any films, and she lacked the glamour and beauty of some of Wayne’s other female partners: Maureen O’Hara, Gail Russell, Lauren Bacall, Angie Dickinson. But it turned out to be inspired casting. They played off each other perfectly and her plain looks gave an authenticity to the role of a hard-working rancher’s wife. Wayne would ridicule method acting techniques to her face but when she would begin to protest, he would say “Ah Geraldine, you’re not mad at old Duke, are you?” She later said he was a dream to act with, “a charmer, a terribly honest man.” The story line was simple enough. Wayne as Hondo Lane, an Army scout, arrives at the ranch of the young woman played by Page and her young son played by television actor, Lee Acker. Acker sees a shadow in the distance and watches as Wayne gradually emerges carrying his saddle. His horse had died, and he was on his way back to the Army post. The opening scene is reminiscent of the opening of Lawrence of Arabia and was used the same year as Hondo in Alan Ladd’s first appearance in Shane . Fearful of Hondo, Page tells him her husband is out looking for lost cattle. In a scene that first establishes their relationship, Hondo gradually draws out from her that she has been abandoned. What makes this key scene so impressive is that Wayne carries on this dialogue with method actress Page while actually shoeing a horse. The story line follows two tracts: the relationship between Page and the Apache and the growing attraction between Hondo and Page. Vittorio adopts Acker when he defends his mother, warning Page to get a husband or he would provide an Apache one for her. In the meantime, Hondo has a fight with a stranger who then tries to ambush him. Hondo kills him only to discover that it is Page’s missing husband. When Hondo returns to Page’s ranch, he can’t bring himself to tell her the truth. Hondo is captured by the Apache and tortured until Vittorio discovers a photo he is carrying of Page, believing him to be her husband. He returns Hondo to Page. In a climatic scene where he finally tells Page of killing her husband, her reaction is simple: “I love you.” Vittorio arrives at the ranch and tells them that his Apache will attack and demands Hondo tell the Army a lie about his attack. “This I will not do.” Hondo replies. “You have good man,” Vittorio then says to Page, “cherish him.” Hondo tells Page that the Apache have no word for lie and that Vittorio was testing him. The clash between the Army and the Apache in a running battle ends the film. Vittorio is killed and Hondo and Page head for his farm in the west. The final scenes were directed as a favor to Wayne from John Ford as Farrow had another directorial commitment he had to honor. Hondo was a success at the box office, earning $4,100,000 against a cost of three million dollars. Page was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting role and L’Amour for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story. Given how L’Amour’s story was revised the latter award is a joke. Wayne was sensitive on that point. He told the press that the film was really his. ”Jesus Christ, don’t you people give me credit for anything.” (READ MORE: John Wayne Rides Again ) Hondo remained one of Wayne’s favorites and some of the characters he developed in his later Westerns bear a close resemblance to the quiet loner, Hondo Lane.

"1","According to the Biden White House, Vice President Kamala Harris will “assist states, local governments, law enforcement, prosecutors, attorneys, judges, clinicians, victim service providers, and behavioral health and other social service providers in optimizing the usage of red flag laws — laws that allow a family member or law enforcement to seek a court order to temporarily take away access to guns if they feel a gun owner may harm themselves or others.” Harris touted red flag laws on a recent visit to Parkland, Florida, site of a deadly school shooting in 2018. Parents concerned for the safety of their children might recall the vice president’s response to a similar attack one year ago at the Covenant School in Nashville. On March 27, 2023, Audrey Hale, 28, gunned down nine-year-olds Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney, and Hallie Scruggs. The shooter, a former Covenant student, also murdered custodian Mike Hill, 61, headmaster Katherine Koonce, 60, and teacher Cynthia Peak, 61. According to autopsy reports, all died from multiple gunshot wounds, some at point-blank range, and Hale added “blunt force trauma” to William Kinney and Katherine Koonce. (READ MORE from Lloyd Billingsley: Fauci and His Minions Are Still in Control) Joe Biden did not identify or condemn Audrey Hale, failed to name a single murder victim, and did not attend any of the funerals. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said “ our hearts go out to the trans community as they are under attack right now .” Kamala Harris tweeted , “six people, including three children, were killed last week in a school shooting in Nashville.” The vice president, stepmother of husband Doug Emhoff’s two children, did not condemn Audrey Hale and failed to name any of her victims. Harris also failed to attend any of the funerals and did not cite the Nashville mass murder as an example of “gun violence.” For the Vice President, this was a repeat performance. On December 2, 2015, at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik gunned down Robert Adams, Isaac Amianos, Bennetta Betbadal, Harry Bowman, Sierra Clayborn, Juan Espinoza, Aurora Godoy, Shannon Johnson, Larry Daniel Kaufman, Damien Meins, Tin Ngyen, Nicholas Thalasinos, Yvette Velasco, and Michael Wetzel. Farook and Malik wounded more than 20 others before local police took down the terrorists. California’s attorney general at the time was former San Francisco district attorney Kamala Harris. “As Americans, we are unified in our commitment to protect our country from terrorist attacks, and we must seek justice for those who lost their lives in the recent attacks in Paris and San Bernardino,” said Harris in a December 17, 2015 statement . The attorney general failed to identify or condemn terrorists Farook and Malik, and named not a single victim. The dead included African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics, but no word from the attorney general whether Farook and Malik could have been motivated by racism. Harris said it was “immoral and contrary to our values to stoke fear and cast aspersions against an entire faith and the millions of law-abiding American Muslims.” One year later, the attorney general lamented “the devastating and tragic terrorist attack in San Bernardino,” but again failed to condemn the terrorists, name a single victim, or brand the mass murder as “gun violence.” In 2019, Sen. Kamala Harris advocated a “ buyback program” for “assault weapons” such as the AR-15 and other semiautomatic firearms, which are legal to own. The owners did not buy those firearms from the government, which therefore cannot buy them back. That betrays a misunderstanding of property rights and the Second Amendment, which stipulates that the right of “the people” to keep and bear arms “shall not be infringed.” The red-flag laws would do that under certain conditions. (READ MORE: Crime and Punishment, California Style ) As the people might recall, the “Biden-Harris” administration has deemed peacefully protesting parents , pro- life activists and such as dangerous extremists.

"2","Quiet on Set , a new docuseries from Investigation Discovery, tells the harrowing story of sexual assault and toxic behavior that took place behind the scenes on some of Nickelodeon’s most popular shows. “I will warn you, if you were a child of the ’90s, this is going to ruin that for you,” a commenter notes grimly in the series opening. Indeed, the documentary will make it impossible to look at many of the network’s beloved programs — from All That to Zoey 101 to The Amanda Show — in the same way. Across four episodes, which are now available to stream on Max, the documentary details the horrific sexual assault Nickelodeon star Drake Bell endured at the hands of a crew member, and the hostile and sexist work environment that showrunner Dan Schneider oversaw. A fifth episode, which will include more interviews with former child stars, airs on April 7. In chronicling these allegations, the docuseries makes clear how vulnerable child actors are to abuse, and how powerful Hollywood creators can normalize harassment. Currently, there is no federal law that protects child actors, so labor policies and safeguards against sexual predators are inconsistent across states . On top of that, there are also gaps in how state laws are enforced, diluting what limited impact they have. Nickelodeon has said it “investigates all formal complaints” and has “adopted numerous safeguards over the years,” in response to the allegations in the documentary. Schneider, who was dropped by Nickelodeon in 2018 after some of these allegations initially came to light, has also expressed regret about aspects of his past behavior. “I definitely owe some people a pretty strong apology,” Schneider said in an interview with BooG!e, an actor from the show iCarly . (Former child actors have critiqued Nickelodeon and Schneider’s responses as “empty” and a failure to take real responsibility for the harm caused .) Beyond calling out the specific issues on Nickelodeon programs, the series also highlights how these problems are systemic, and how they go beyond any one show, any one director, or even any one studio. “It shows that there are not enough protections in place to keep even convicted sexual predators off of kids’ TV shows,” Kate Taylor, a Business Insider reporter whose investigation of the network inspired the documentary, says in one clip. The allegations detailed in the docuseries, explained The allegations described in Quiet on Set include harrowing instances of sexual misconduct, pervasive harassment, and troubling plotlines that sexualize children: Sexual assault On repeated occasions, sexual predators at Nickelodeon capitalized on their roles to abuse kids. Brian Peck : Peck, a dialogue coach on shows including The Amanda Show and All That , was convicted of sexually abusing a minor in 2004. At the time, the child’s identity was kept private and records were sealed. In this documentary, Nickelodeon actor Drake Bell speaks publicly about the assault, and his experience enduring it, for the first time. Peck was charged with 11 counts of abuse, and convicted of engaging in a lewd act with a minor and of oral copulation with a minor. Following this conviction, he was sentenced to 16 months in prison and forced to register as a sex offender. Bell, who was roughly 15 at the time of the abuse, describes the trauma of Peck’s actions, and how he used his position on set to embed himself in Bell’s life. Because Peck lived closer to the set than Bell’s mother, he’d often drive the actor to work and let him crash at his place. Bell says the first instance of assault occurred when he was sleeping on Peck’s couch and woke up to being violated. “The abuse was extensive and it got pretty brutal,” Bell said in the documentary, noting that he was afraid to speak out due to Peck’s position and fears of endangering his own job. After Bell told his mother about the assaults, Peck eventually confessed to his actions, which led to his arrest. A number of powerful figures in Hollywood including actors James Marsden and Alan Thicke, as well as Nickelodeon directors Beth and Rich Correll, wrote character letters in support of Peck. ( The Corrells have since apologized .) Many of these letters vouched for Peck, and some suggested that Bell acted as a temptation to him. In another shocking turn, Peck was hired to do voiceover work on the Disney show The Suite Life of Zack and Cody after he got out of prison and was already a convicted sex offender. Jason Handy: Handy, a production assistant on shows like All That and The Amanda Show pleaded “no contest” to lewd acts on a child and the distribution of sexually explicit material in 2004, both counts tied to his actions toward girls on Nickelodeon shows . Handy served six years in prison, registered as a convicted sex offender, and was charged again with new offenses a few years after his release. In the documentary, a mother named MJ describes how Handy sent a photo of himself masturbating to her 11-year-old daughter Brandi, whom he met on a Nickelodeon set. Handy also assaulted another girl he met at Nickelodeon who was acting on the show Cousin Skeeter . In a raid of Handy’s home, law enforcement found hundreds of sexually explicit photos of young girls , as well as ziplock bags with different girls’ names on them that included individual mementos. In his journal, Handy also described himself as a “ pedophile ” and said he had difficulty controlling his urges around kids. Ezel Channel: Channel, a freelance animator at Nickelodeon, was accused of bringing multiple teenage boys to his workplace, molesting them, and showing them pornography . He was convicted of lewd acts on a minor and of showing a minor pornography in 2009 and had already been a convicted sex offender when he began work at Nickelodeon, a sign of how little scrutiny there was on people’s records. A hostile work environment Schneider, a producer on multiple Nickelodeon juggernauts, including All That, The Amanda Show, Drake and Josh, Sam & Cat, and iCarly , is also accused of creating a hostile work environment that was rampant with sexual harassment and racism. Sexism: Multiple women who worked on these shows, including two writers and a costumer, described a pattern of sexist behavior on set. Schneider would regularly demand that women give him massages and show pornography to the staff, they said. Two of the early women writers hired for The Amanda Show — Christy Stratton and Jenny Kilgen — also said they were asked to split a salary, and that they were the subject of inappropriate jokes and scenarios in a predominantly male writer’s room. In one instance, one of the writers was asked if she had ever done phone sex for work, and in another, a writer was asked to pitch an idea while acting like she was being sodomized. Schneider has denied underpaying women writers and apologized for his inappropriate comments to writers. “It was wrong that I put anybody in that position,” he said, regarding the massages he requested. The documentary also scrutinizes how close Schneider was to young girls on set, including his frequent massaging of child actors, and the revealing wardrobe he often had them wear for shows. Jennette McCurdy, a former child actor on the Nickelodeon shows iCarly and Sam & Cat , previously wrote about an anonymous showrunner, nicknamed The Creator, who is thought to be Schneider, engaging in similar acts. Racism: Two Black actors noted that they were tokenized on the shows that they were on and subject to plotlines that relied on racial profiling. Actor Bryan Hearne also expressed concerns about retaliation because his mom spoke up against the racism he experienced. Abuse and berating: A number of people interviewed in the documentary note that Schneider could be unpredictable and temperamental, including berating and undermining people for their work. Following a Nickelodeon investigation, which did not find evidence of sexual misconduct, but did find proof of abusive behavior, Schneider was dropped by the network in 2018. Inappropriate, sexualized plot points Another chief issue in the documentary is how Schneider repeatedly sexualized kids, putting them in scenarios and making them do jokes that were completely inappropriate. Some of the examples it highlights include a scene in Zoey 101 when a tube of goo squirts all over Jamie Lynn Spears’s face. “We heard the boys saying, ‘It’s a cum shot,’” says Alexa Nikolas, a fellow actor on the show. Other disturbing scenes include ones in Victorious that show Ariana Grande massaging a potato, sucking on her toes, and pouring water all over herself. Jokes that involved a girl asking another if she wanted to get hit in the face with a sausage and frequent zoom-ins on kids’ feet were troubling, too. In addition to putting child actors in uncomfortable situations, these scenes also exposed millions of kids who watched them to sexual scenarios and innuendos in a problematic way. “This is a show for kids, so who is sexual innuendo for on a kids show?” asked Scaachi Koul, a former BuzzFeed News culture writer and consultant for the docuseries. Schneider has said that executives at the company broadly approved these scenes and that he’d be open to removing offensive ones from streaming versions. The documentary stresses how vulnerable child actors are — and how they need more protections Notably, Quiet on Set raises issues that have plagued the industry for some time. While Nickelodeon is its focal point, the problems it describes are far from limited to one network. “I know a lot of kids that grew up in the industry,” Evan Rachel Wood, a former child actor, says in a 2020 documentary called Showbiz Kids . “And what surprised me when I got older was finding out that pretty much all of the young men were abused in some way sexually.” Child actors are omitted from federal laws overseeing issues like hours and overtime because acting was not viewed as “oppressive child labor” when the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in 1938, HuffPost reported . As a result, any labor protections for child actors are left up to the states, 17 of which have opted not to implement any at all. Even when states do have laws, however, they continue to struggle with proper enforcement. Take California: Overall, the state’s laws on child actors are seen as some of the strongest in the country, and they include limits on the hours a kid can work each day, the need to obtain a permit to become a child actor, and mandatory meals and rest breaks. These policies also require a parent to be on set, and within sightline of a child under 16. And they set aside mandatory time each day for schooling, and call on the on-set teacher to serve as another guardian for a child’s well- being and safety. Two other California laws are also dedicated to protecting children’s earnings, and screening people who work with child actors. The latter, AB 1660, requires certain professionals who work with children to pass an FBI background check and obtain a permit. These laws have limited utility if not properly enforced, however. “Whatever laws you have, they have to be enforced, and whoever has to enforce them has to have the resources to do it,” New York University adjunct law professor Day Krolik , who previously worked in the entertainment industry, told Vox. Such enforcement could come from state Labor Departments and take the form of financial penalties or other ramifications if a network violates these laws. As Deadline found in a 2018 investigation, for example, AB 1660 was rarely enforced, meaning there were few, if any, consequences if a professional it applied to hadn’t gotten a background check. Many former child actors and parents are now calling for new laws that fill in current gaps and bolster protections for kids. Krolik notes that a federal law standardizing labor policy could help address inconsistencies across states and guarantee these protections no matter where a child works. Advocates have called, too, for laws that bar the use of nondisclosure agreements in instances of sexual misconduct or harassment. And Alyson Stoner , a former Disney Channel star, is among those who have emphasized the importance of a law requiring a mental health professional to be present on set, so children have someone to talk to if they’re struggling. With kids increasingly being used to help parents generate income in social media content and YouTube videos, advocates note that existing laws should also be expanded to include and shield these young creators as well. As Quiet on Set makes evident, stricter policies and follow-through are vital to ensure that the issues it documents don’t continue. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","The 40-hour workweek in the US will turn 84 this June, making it older than most human beings alive today. But unlike humans, who are always changing and adapting, today’s standard workweek has spent its 84 years frozen in time. The last time federal law reduced the workweek was in 1940. An amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) dropped the threshold of hours after which workers qualify for overtime pay from 44 to 40, capping off a steady decline in average working hours that began back around 1830 . And then — nothing. Earlier this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–VT) introduced a bill that would pick the trend back up, cutting the workweek down to 32 hours over the course of four years. The bill would use the same mechanism as the FLSA: lowering the overtime pay threshold to 32 hours, which would drive employers of hourly or non-exempt salaried workers to treat 32 hours as “full-time.” To prevent wages from falling accordingly, the bill forbids employers from cutting pay to go along with the shorter hours. For many white-collar workers shifting into a four-day, 32-hour week — say, journalists at Vox — the expectation would be that we produce roughly the same amount of work more efficiently (by cutting out pointless meetings and benefiting from less stress and burnout). For workers who can’t just cut out meetings to become more efficient, like those doing physical labor, the bill would essentially grant them a 20 percent raise since they’d be doing eight hours of work less for the same pay. During a hearing by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (which Sanders chairs), Sanders and Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers union , pointed out that since 1940, worker productivity has risen more than 400 percent , all while the standard workweek hasn’t budged. They argue that’s because the decline of workers’ bargaining power has left the gains in productivity to benefit the wealthy, not workers. Despite widespread support among employees and even some growing interest among employers , the bill will almost certainly not reach the Senate floor for a vote, let alone clear the Republican-led House and wind up on President Biden’s desk. Critics like Sen. Bill Cassidy (R–LA) argue that while a 32-hour week sounds nice on the surface, it would wind up hurting workers it’s meant to benefit by incentivizing employers to raise prices, automate jobs, or send them overseas, rather than dishing out 20 percent raises. One of the biggest obstacles to making progress on shorter workweeks is that federal legislation can be a blunt tool, and a top-down approach could fail to allow for the fine-tuning that would make it fit across different industries and worker preferences. Roger King , a labor relations attorney, commented during the committee hearing that suggests a way forward on delivering shorter weeks to workers who want them: “If Mr. Fain’s union can negotiate with the auto companies in this country to do a 32-hour workweek, so be it,” said King. Conservatives and progressives alike can agree that labor and industry representatives should be free to bargain with each other. That’s how some of the biggest changes to the economy have come in the past: Collective bargaining agreements between unions and bosses secured and adapted changes like the eight-hour day to their particular industries, hashing out best practices on the ground and paving the way for federal legislation to spread them across the rest of the economy. Bills like Sanders’s can help ignite conversation and set agendas, but actual progress on achieving a shorter workweek is more likely to come from below. To secure such a major change to economic life, American workers will need more bargaining power than they have today. While union activity seems to be coming back after being dismantled over decades, and wages are rising fastest for workers who make the least, we’re still far from the kind of power needed to pick up the old thread of reducing the workweek . History, though, offers an excellent example of how workers, once sufficiently empowered, can drive changes of that magnitude. Consider the rise of codetermination — a practice now common throughout Western Europe where workers have a voice in business decisions by holding voting seats on corporate boards — across Germany in the 20th century. Codetermination was once seen as a major change that would chart a path toward a “ new economy ,” but it didn’t arise via federal law. At least, not at first. It took decades of unionized workers building enough leverage to negotiate for smaller codetermination arrangements in their own industries, from coal miners to electrical engineers, all before there was enough consensus to pass federal legislation that extended codetermination rights across the German economy. “Federal legislation that sets minimum standards and collective bargaining are complementary,” said Ewan McGaughey , a professor of law and economic history at King’s College in London. “You don’t want one without the other.” If shorter working weeks are going to return as a real possibility in the 21st century, the US will first need more than a couple advocates in the Senate, and the country will need a labor movement powerful enough to bargain for them . How collective bargaining paved the way for national codetermination in Germany Codetermination in Germany began, believe it or not, with a benevolent boss. The basic idea behind codetermination is that employers should not have total control over the business — workers should have a voice in company decisions, too. As McGaughey explains in his 2015 paper on The Codetermination Bargains , the sentiment first arose among those sympathetic to the growing plight of workers toiling in miserable conditions stemming from the Industrial Revolution. If labor could “co-determine” the economy alongside bosses, they could help bend the arc of economic development toward their benefit, not just that of capital. In 1848, a Saxon textile factory owner named Carl Degenkolb was elected to the newly formed Frankfurt Parliament , which arose in response to the ongoing German Revolutions expressing discontent with autocratic rule. The parliament aimed to unify the German states into a single national government based on parliamentary democracy. Ultimately, it failed. Degenkolb, however, had come to the belief that worker participation in guiding economic activity was as important as political participation. He pitched his belief to the rest of the parliament, proposing the idea of having councils in every business district. One-third of these councils would be elected by workers, the other two-thirds by employers, and the workers could reach binding decisions about the workplace, from drafting factory ordinances (including pension scheme administration) to child care and health care . While Degenkolb didn’t convince a majority of members, he released an unofficial draft of his ideas anyway. He convinced three fellow industrialists to implement the practices in their own factories. Historians could find no records of how the experiment played out but believe the practices remained in place until Degenkolb died in 1862. The idea of worker participation then began to spread across Germany, garnering labor’s support — and capital’s ire. But it wasn’t until the end of World War I that the balance of bargaining power leaned far enough in workers’ favor to get federal laws passed in what had become the Weimar Republic. The costs of war and the sanctions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles decimated German business interests, leaving them uniquely vulnerable to labor demands. In November 1918, Germany’s three largest unions met with the employers’ federations to negotiate the Stinnes-Legien Agreement , a bargain that would set the course for the post-war economy. The agreement secured all workers the freedom to associate (basically, to form bargaining organizations like unions), and guaranteed work councils in all companies with more than 50 employees. Workdays were capped at eight hours, and working conditions were regulated in each trade via collective agreements bargained by their relevant unions. After four years of these agreements spreading across industries, the Supervisory Council Act of 1922 codified them as national law. It also went one step further, requiring that all German corporations with supervisory boards grant employee representatives up to two seats on the board, giving workers direct voting rights on company decisions. That gave codetermination a foothold in the boardroom. At first, it was weak in practice. Worker representatives made up a minority of the board, meaning they could never win head-to-head votes against management. And businesses quickly adapted, curbing the influence of worker voice by reducing the number of decisions supervisory boards were tasked to make, having fewer meetings, and bypassing the boards altogether by having shareholders delegate tasks to sub-committees. The aftermath of World War II opened another opportunity for bargaining power to secure stronger legislation. German businesses were decimated after the war. Their alignment with the Nazi regime had undermined their moral authority, and thus political power, in the nascent post-war order. In response, unions pressed the advantage. In 1947, unions representing coal and steel workers struck a deal through a series of conferences with steel employers. Seats of the supervisory boards in their industries would be shared equally by workers and employers, effective immediately. Movements for further codetermination spread across the four zones of Allied occupation in what then became West Germany, from the railways of the French-occupied zone to copper smelters in Duisburg. But as businesses began to recover from the economic ruins of the war, opposition to codetermination started to mount. Konrad Adenauer, the first elected chancellor of West Germany, responded by passing the Mining Codetermination Act of 1951 , securing the coal and steel workers’ agreement as federal law. A year later, Adenauer’s government passed the Work Constitution Act, spreading the right to one-third supervisory board representation to workers across all German industries. “The codetermination bargains forged a social consensus,” writes McGaughey. And in 1976, the commitment to codetermination was deepened by raising worker representation to one-half of the board for all companies with more than 2,000 employees. “This consensus was codified into law.” The Goldilocks conditions for big policy change Codetermination represented a major change to the German economy. It restructured the power dynamics that decide how the economy directs and invests its resources. McGaughey believes it was only possible thanks to what he calls the two Goldilocks conditions: rare moments of organized labor experiencing relatively equal bargaining power to employers, and a labor movement united around a shared objective. Imagining a similar Goldilocks- style bargaining-first approach to shorter workweeks today doesn’t require all that much of an imaginative leap, at least in theory. It’s how we got the workweek down to 40 hours in the first place here in the States. The Fair Labor Standards Act , which gave us the 40-hour week in 1940, was itself built upon existing collective bargaining agreements that organized workers won for eight-hour days. Whether it’s the International Typographical Union that went on strike before securing eight-hour days in 1906, or the railroad industry unions threatening a nationwide strike that won the same rights through the Adamson Act in 1916, this basic pattern was behind both codetermination’s rise in Germany and the eight-hour day in the US: First, collective bargaining paves the way, then federal legislation codifies it. Today, while the labor movement has seen some of its first signs of a return to power in decades, union membership is still hovering around 10 percent, the lowest since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started collecting this data in 1983. The US is a long way from that first Goldilocks condition of equal bargaining power with employers, but some unions are making strides. A municipal employees union in San Juan County, Washington, secured a 32-hour week last August, joining other unions that have bargained for 32-hour weeks at companies like Kickstarter and organizations like Local Progress . Just last month, the largest union at Boeing (representing over 32,000 factory workers in the state of Washington) announced that they’re seeking a seat on the company board — that’s codetermination — after doors and wheels have been flying off their airplanes . To change the structure of an entire economy, though, you need more than isolated unions bargaining with individual employers. McGaughey explained that ideally, you want mandates from federal law, states, collective bargaining agreements, and individual workplace contracts all stacked like a pyramid, each building on the last to fine-tune policy to better fit with industry contexts and worker preferences. Federal mandates should set the basic parameters, like minimum wages or maximum workweeks, which act as the baseline of what’s considered acceptable no matter one’s industry or preferences. States can go further, like setting higher minimum wages than what comes from the federal level. “Louis Brandeis, who became a US Supreme Court Justice [he served from 1916 to 1939], talks about states being the laboratories of democracy,” said McGaughey. “There’s no reason you couldn’t have a working time act in every Democratic legislature, starting with Vermont.” Next, collective bargaining agreements can set standards across industries. Here, the US labor movement lags far behind peer countries in Western Europe, where sectoral bargaining is common . But again, there are glimmers of progress emerging. The idea of sectoral bargaining has been gaining traction for years in the US. In 2016, a report from the Center for American Progress argued that the future of worker voice and power lies in “transforming unions from individual firm-level bargaining units into organizations or structures ... that negotiate for higher wages and benefits across an entire industry or sector.” And in September, California was home to one of the US’s first sectoral bargaining agreements in decades. Labor unions secured a deal with fast food companies to establish a $20 minimum wage across the industry. The bill also established a form of codetermination, creating a nine-member council split between representatives for workers and employers. The council will vote on minimum standards across the industry moving forward, including wages, hours, and conditions. The question that remains is whether any of these efforts will reach the top of the pyramid and drive higher-level legislation. In addition to Sanders’s federal 32-hour bill, states like Massachusetts , Maryland , and California have 32-hour bills floating around. Both Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have their own codetermination bills out, too. But if any bills are actually going to gain ground on making shorter weeks a reality for those who want them, it’s probably going to be ones like the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act , which could restore and protect workers’ right to organize and make it easier to form larger and larger bargaining units . Or more worker-friendly social policies like the fully refundable child tax credit , portable benefits (like health insurance and retirement accounts) that employees can transfer between employers , beefed-up unemployment insurance , or the Ghent System of running unemployment through unions (which helps to build membership). These, in turn, would send more power back down to workers and bargaining units on the ground, feeding efforts that could send pressure upward while smoothing the way for federal legislation to codify whatever objectives empowered workers are already negotiating with industry representatives. During the UAW union’s high- profile, strike-driven negotiation with auto manufacturers last year, a 32-hour week began as one of their demands . It was quickly shot down by automakers over the same concerns heard at Sanders’s recent hearing (instead, they won 25 percent wage increases over four and a half years). Fain’s appearance alongside Sanders indicates that more unions could be returning to the demand for shorter weeks, which served as the historical foundation for the American labor movement. “A number of unions that represent low-wage workers are becoming interested in this,” said Vishal Reddy, executive director of the four-day-focused nonprofit, WorkFour . Now, as we’re beginning to navigate a century of adaptation to climate change , AI , shifting geopolitical landscapes , and everything else on the growing list of world- shaping forces, the question is whether workers might gain enough power to make shorter hours not just a utopian longing of the past , but a part of our future, too.

"1","Reporting in The Diplomat , Katja Drinhausen, the head of the Politics and Society Program at the Mercator Institute for Chinese Studies, notes that the implementation of China’s Hong Kong National Security Law by the Legislative Council’s (Hong Kong’s Parliament) passage of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance has imposed the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) ideology on Hong Kong’s citizens, resulting in “another blow to civil liberties in the city.” The vote for passage of what Drinhausen characterizes as the “draconian” ordinance in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council was 89 to zero. The new ordinance, as explained in the Legislative Council Brief , adds to Hong Kong’s criminal code the offenses of “insurrection, treason, external interference … espionage” and a catchall offense called “incitement to disaffection.” The latter is reminiscent of broad Soviet criminal statutes that outlawed “anti-Soviet” agitation and conduct. Drinhausen notes that under the new ordinance — which was just passed on March 19 th — mere contacts and exchanges of information with “external forces” can be deemed illegal. The term used by the ordinance is “colluding with external force.” In communist countries, the “law” is a facade for state and party rule. The last paragraph of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s third-volume of The Gulag Archipelago sums it up best: “For half a century and more the enormous state has towered over us, girded with hoops of steel. The hoops are still there. There is no law,” (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: With Biden, the Lippmann Gap Returns ) The Hong Kong ordinance, known as Article 23 of the Basic Law, was justified in terms of “national security” by the newly “elected” Legislative Council, which is nothing more than an extension of the CCP. Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing Chief Executive John Lee said that the new law was a “glorious achievement” that shows that Hong Kong is “living up to the trust placed in us by the Central Authorities,” i.e., the CCP. Lee and the members of the Legislative Council have shown themselves to be nothing more than modern-day quislings in the service of the tyrannical CCP. Human Rights Watch condemned the Legislative council’s actions, saying that the new law “eliminates the last vestiges of fundamental freedoms” in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Democracy Council, based overseas, urged the Biden administration to “step up for political prisoners and freedom in Hong Kong.” Meanwhile, the Biden State Department expressed “concerns” that the new legislation will be used to “eliminate dissent through fear of arrest and detention” and “restrict the free speech of U.S. citizens and residents” and further “curtail[] the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong.” Beijing responded by calling on Washington to “respect China’s sovereignty, and immediately stop meddling in [China’s] internal affairs.” Back in 1997, Britain threw Hong Kong to the wolves of the CCP, perhaps under the mistaken belief that Beijing was abandoning communism and evolving into a capitalist, if authoritarian, regime like that in Singapore. The West’s “engagement” of China, which was justified during the last two decades of the Cold War, should have ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. But business interests here and in Europe, Japan and elsewhere, coupled with Western elites who welcomed China into the “rules-based international order,” had their way. There was a lot of money to be made in China. The quest for short-term profits at the expense of long-term security was evidence of what James Burnham once called the “suicidal mania of American business.” In Taiwan, there were public demonstrations against the new Hong Kong law. Taiwan’s leaders and citizens recognize that what is happening in Hong Kong will be their future should China gain control of the island. In the United States, Taiwan is more than just a human rights concern. It is a strategic concern of the highest order. Taiwan is the geopolitical anchor in a series of island chains in the western Pacific that helps to contain the hegemonic ambitions of the CCP. It is today the object of increasing pressure from China’s People’s Liberation Army. ( We Are Closer Than You Think to Civilizational Suicide: Lessons From Burnham ) Historical analogies are never exact, and the Munich analogy has been overused and abused by Western statesmen. But those who are willing to ignore the significance of the threat to Taiwan and to U.S. national security posed by the Chinese communist menace would do well to reflect on the words of Winston Churchill on September 21, 1938, after the Western powers surrendered the Sudetenland to Hitler to avoid war: “The belief that security can be obtained by throwing a small state to the wolves is a fatal delusion.”"
"1","Among the least pressing problems facing Washington these days is what to do with all our neglected NeoCons now that Donald Trump has seized the Republican Party and decisively evicted them from their chosen home. They are still rattling around the D.C. think tank world, with regular publications showing the world they are at least alive, if not thriving. Without the support of a party, they have become ideological orphans, ignored by the foreign policy apparatus. The Democrats don’t want them, both for the lingering odor of the Iraqi misadventure and the unwelcome reminder that the Democratic leadership took their counsel and supported it. Where can the NeoCons peddle their policy wares now that Washington has little use for them? A reasonable answer must first consider what are those wares, exactly? By 2006, the NeoCon “brand” had become so tarnished that the very label became obscured by opprobrium just short of the “fascism” curse bandied about by progressives today. Before that dark chapter though, the term derived from a discrete set of policy axioms residing not far outside the broad historical spectrum of U.S. foreign policy. Foremost, that the assertive use of American military power could stabilize the world in terms favorable to the Western liberal democracies. Second, that liberal democracy is a system applicable to a wide variety of the world’s polities, and U.S. power could inculcate it in these places. And finally, that the United States had a unique responsibility to both manage the international system and to bear a disproportionate cost for maintaining its primacy. In sum, not much more than a vigorous retooling of the internationalism of John Kennedy or Woodrow Wilson. What gave these ideas renewed purchase on U.S. foreign policy was an overweening hubris derived from the First Gulf War. Over the opposition of the media, the anti-war activists, and a sizable number of Democrats, the NeoCons were vindicated by a smashing victory over Saddam Hussein in a mere 100 hours. The Clinton White House adopted the NeoCon project when it went to war against Slobodan Milosovic and his Serb henchmen without UN sanction. After American power prevailed in the Balkans, the NeoCons appeared securely ensconced in both parties. The next war to topple a dictator would certainly prove them right again. (READ MORE from Karl Pfefferkorn: The US and Gaza Mission Creep ) But it didn’t. The NeoCon project foundered on that next war and the ugly reality of post-war Iraq. Saddam was vanquished, but average Iraqis proved indifferent or violently hostile to their American liberators. U.S. military power proved highly effective at destroying a ruling regime, but woefully incapable of erecting a durable successor government. The experiment of governing post-war Iraq suggested that liberal democracy was not a universal governing paradigm, but rather a highly contingent phenomenon that emerged from unusual historical circumstances in the West. The NeoCons discovered to their dismay that Iraq in 2003 was not analogous to Germany in 1945. A NeoCon syllabus with a little less Francis Fukuyama and little more Max Weber might have saved the United States many lives and much treasure. Today, the aim of implanting democracy worldwide has been displaced by a weary acceptance of stable authoritarianism in its various shades of ferocity. Where might the NeoCon project still resonate? Not in the U.S. Donald Trump in word and Joe Biden in deed have embarked on a protectionist project designed to insulate America from foreign competition, China and Europe alike. Economic populism is incompatible with the interventionist internationalism favored by the NeoCons and represents a profound renunciation of America’s leadership of the liberal free trade regime. But there is one place where the NeoCon program could thrive, albeit under an assumed name with a limited scope. In Europe, and specifically Ukraine, the unique historical antecedents for liberal democracy do pertain. Ever since it came blinking out into the daylight as head of an independent state, the government in Kiev has suffered from spectacular levels of corruption and an electorate divided by language and loyalties. The war utterly transformed the country. It has made the campaign against corruption a matter of national survival, and has joined Western and Eastern Ukrainians in opposition to the Russian invaders. You could reasonably argue that Vladimir Putin is the father of a unified Ukrainian nation committed to liberal democracy and its attendant prosperity. What Ukraine desperately needs is the support of a Europe committed to what can be quietly termed regional NeoCon principles, although we should politely attribute them to President Macron or perhaps Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. What they share is the belief that Europe has the power to save the Ukrainian state, through massive increases in military assistance, economic aid, and perhaps even intervention. Macron believes that the future of Europe depends on it. (READ MORE: The Heartbreak of the Brideshead Republicans ) Post-war liberal democracy is already the strong preference of the Ukrainian people, and the European Union is well- suited to encourage it, through extensive aid, and the governance requirements imposed on every candidate member. The magic that the EU worked in Poland in the 1990’s can work again in Ukraine. There will be no better refutation of Putin’s imperial Russia than a Ukraine thriving and prosperous under EU tutelage and European protection. Europe is the natural regional counterweight to authoritarian Russia. It should assume the role of regional hegemon akin to the expansive global role the NeoCons proposed for America in the 1990’s. Europe can secure Ukrainian independence if a mere fraction of its industrial capacity and military might are devoted to it. The limited regional scope of this interventionist moment grants it a far better chance of success than the global hubris touted by our own NeoCons not so long ago. Perhaps we could spare a few to help Brussels realize its destiny. They need the work."
"1","T he oldest put-down in New York always revolves around buying the Brooklyn Bridge. The tag line is always something like, “If you’re that dumb I’ve got a bridge to sell ya.” There are a lot of variations on that theme and President Biden invented another one this week. Waking up to the collision of the container ship MV Dali with the Francis Scott Key bridge in Baltimore, Biden had two reactions. As the (very) old liberal he is, he automatically wanted to throw money at the problem, so he promised to pay for replacing the bridge even before he declared that Easter Sunday was “transgender visibility day.” We’ll get back to federal funding in a minute. Biden’s second comment was that he remembered traveling over that same bridge many times by train. The problem with that, of course, is that the Key Bridge never had railroad tracks on it. Now the wokesters are saying that the new bridge shouldn’t be named after Key, the composer of our national anthem. He evidently owned slaves, so the bridge — when its eventually rebuilt — will be renamed. (READ MORE from Jed Babbin: Dark Irony at the UN ) Thanks to videos taken of the ship’s collision with the bridge and the bridge’s immediate collapse and what the National Transportation Safety Board has told us, we have a good but incomplete picture of what happened. One report — not from the NTSB — says that the ship suffered a power failure before it left the dock. If it had, and didn’t remain docked until the problem was diagnosed and repaired, someone was significantly negligent. According to the NTSB the Dali left the port at about 12:39 am, going slowly, as ships always do in harbors. At 1:24 am, alarms started going off, indicating a big problem. At 1:27 am, the harbor pilots — again according to the NTSB — ordered the crew to drop the anchor. They must have been in contact with police and shore parties by that time. Two minutes later, the ship collided with the bridge at about 8 mph. If you’ve seen the videos of the ship colliding with the bridge you saw that the Dali seemed to blow a large amount of smoke which could be the crew and pilots trying to reverse the engines at emergency speed to attempt to slow the ship and prevent the collision. Then the ship apparently takes a sharp turn to starboard (right) and goes into the bridge pier and the bridge collapses very quickly. The Dali — which displaces over 95,000 tons (empty) and is about 300 meters long — is roughly the size of a Nimitz -class aircraft carrier. It holds about ten thousand containers which increase the weight. (Shipping containers such as these are what you see on the back of heavy 18-wheelers going down the highway.) Some of the Dali’s containers reportedly have hazardous materials in them such as lithium-ion batteries. None of the hazardous materials have reportedly leaked so far. Given the physics — momentum equals mass (roughly what something weighs) multiplied by velocity — it’s no wonder that the ship quickly demolished one of the bridge’s main piers and resulted in the bridge’s collapse. Police reportedly had about ninety seconds to stop traffic over the bridge before the collision. They somehow managed to do so. At least six people were killed — workers on the bridge — in the accident. Not all of the bodies have been recovered yet because their recovery is blocked by the wreckage and conditions are adverse to divers’ access. Had the police not stopped traffic, had the collision occurred when traffic across the bridge was heavier, the death toll would have been much higher. According to the NTSB, the Key Bridge was “fracture critical,” which means that any damage to its principal piers could cause collapse. Again, according to the NTSB, eight other bridges in the U.S. are rated the same way, including the Verrazano Narrows bridge in New York City. All eight are critical commerce arteries in California, Maryland, Oregon, New York, and Washington. Remember Obama’s economic stimulus plan which he said was meant for “shovel-ready” projects? None of that money was spent on strengthening those bridges. So let’s get back to what Biden said. Rebuilding the bridge isn’t the Feds’ problem. The cost of replacing it may yet be borne by the government, but it shouldn’t be. It’s up to the ship’s insurers and others who may be held liable for the damages to pay for it. Nevertheless, it probably can’t be rebuilt without federal funds, given Maryland’s — and the country’s — sinking economy. The litigation will go on for years. The Feds’ real problem is clearing the harbor and making trade flow again. At the risk of stating the obvious, the ship and the bridge wreckage are blocking any ships from going into or coming out of Baltimore harbor. Baltimore is one of the busiest ports on the East Coast. Twenty-eight percent of our coal exports went through it last year. Hundreds of thousands of cars are imported through Baltimore every year. According to Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, 52 million tons of foreign cargo worth about $80 billion came in through Baltimore. (READ MORE: Biden’s Strange Story Collapses in Bridge Collapse Presser ) The bridge’s wreckage certainly weighs more than one million pounds. Some of it lies across the ship’s bow. The Navy has moved massive cranes to help clear the harbor. They include the “Chesapeake,” which reportedly can lift two thousand tons — two million pounds — is on scene along with four other Navy cranes. The bridge parts will have to be cut or blown apart to enable the cranes to begin to clear the ship and remains of the bridge from the harbor. The process is likely to take at least weeks or months. Main sections of the I-685 Baltimore Beltway will be closed until the bridge is rebuilt at a cost that will be in the billions of dollars. It will take years to accomplish. Maybe then an ex-president Biden can ride across it on a train."
"1","Last Good Friday, I visited the chapel of my church, conveniently located on the Florida island where I live. It’s one of only six in the Miami area that houses the living Host for twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. A series of mortal setbacks to loved ones over the past five years — including my mother’s cancer (cured), the death of her beloved companion, the death of my ex-girlfriend’s only son , and other family health issues — have considerably elongated my prayer list, so I try to seek help from the Lord every evening in His presence. But on Good Friday, I found the sepulcher empty and the adoring twin angels beside it covered by purple mourning cloth. And I thought, what a perfect reflection of not only this holy weekend but of our time — the perceived absence of Christ. Most people agree that the country is in a dark age, as do I, the bleakest in my lifetime. Depression in young people is spiking , particularly among females, as their once clear life purpose, even unalterable sexuality, come under divisive Marxist attack. And boys, especially white boys, get taught they will become toxic men, with few role models to indicate the opposite. Too many religious leaders, including the successor to Apostle Peter, either accept or embrace this demonism. They may not be able to recruit more worshippers, but they can certainly weaken their institutions. A new Gallup poll shows a steep decline in religious observation across the spectrum. According to the poll, only 44 percent of Protestant Christians now attend regular services, with Catholics at an abysmal 33 percent. Outspoken traditionalist churchmen like Bishop Joseph Strickland — the Vatican-displaced bishop of Tyler, Texas — are bravely and accurately blaming the hierarchy. “Up there is an agenda that is gradually pulling all those people away from faith and pulling them into communism,” Strickland told Red State . (READ MORE from Lou Aguilar: England Reconstructs Camelot ) It all evokes the days following the Crucifixion, when to the faithful all seemed lost. The man they had forsaken their past lives to follow had been tortuously executed, leaving them at the mercy of the rabble that condemned Him. Yet unlike in Israel, where those events took place two thousand years ago, “when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews,” (John 20:19), today both Jews and Christians face equal persecution by the State and the godless activists in control of it. All over America, mobs educated by the Judeo-Christian tradition scream for the extermination of the nation that gave birth to it, and the people who further it, in favor of the murderous savages with whom they share nothing other than contempt for Western Civilization. That in the world they’re pushing for, they would be the first to go — see Queers for Palestine — never occurs to them, so blinded are they by hate. While the fools nominally leading this country bend to their will, both out of desperation to retain power and loathing for religious conservatives. Last Monday, the United States abstained on a United Nations Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestine, which allowed the resolution to pass. The inept Biden Administration knew this would cripple Israel from forestalling another large scale Jewish massacre like that of October 7 th , 2023, but as usual Democratic Party politics took precedence over good and evil. Another recent Gallup poll shows Americans disapprove of Israeli military action in Gaza — 55 percent to 36 percent, among Democrats a stunning 75 percent to 18 percent — following relentless anti-Israel media bombardment. Unfortunately for the longtime U.S. ally, abandoning the righteous course for votes is the Left’s modus operandi . So is hostility to Christians, in full display this Easter. The White House is prohibiting children of National Guard personnel from submitting religious-themed Easter Eggs for the “2024 Celebrating National Guard Families” event. The event flyer states that Easter Egg design submissions “must not include any questionable content, religious symbols, overtly religious symbols, or partisan political statements.” Because to the progressive mind, religious symbols equal questionable content and partisan political statements. Consequently, any illustrative reference to the reason for the holiday — such as an empty cave tomb — would be strictly forbidden. (READ MORE: Midway in the Culture War ) It gets worse, or better, because the Biden regime doesn’t realize that, despite the decline in religious worship, the tide has turned against one leftist delusion. Instead, Biden just declared March 31 st , Easter Sunday, “Transgender Day of Visibility.” In Biden land, kids can’t depict or suggest the Resurrection of the Lord, yet he will celebrate the fantasy that men can become women or vice- versa, with all the surgical butchery required to fail miserably in the attempt. His idiocy opened the politically endangered President not only to Christian outrage but to Republican mockery. “Isn’t every day at the Biden White House ‘ Transgender Day of Visibility ’?” “tweeted” Harmeet K. Dhillon, vice-president of the Republican National Lawyers Association. The ridiculous Admiral Rachel (“Richard”) Levine may agree with her. But the faithless will lose in the end. It will be the ultimate Easter Rabbit trick. Beginning this Sunday, when I visit the chapel, the Host will be in the sepulcher. And the world will realize what the faithful did two-thousand years ago on the Road to Emmaus. That the Lord has risen and walks among us. Happy Easter."
"1","During the past several months the corporate media have devoted a lot of coverage to a species of voter they describe as “double haters.” This pejorative label notwithstanding, such voters are neither unique to the current election cycle nor particularly hateful. It’s probably more accurate to call them double dissenters. They disapprove of the presumptive presidential nominees offered by the two major political parties and decline to choose the “lesser of two evils.” Some may sit out 2024 and others may vote for an independent like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This has earned them the derision of a pundit class that fears most third-party votes will be cast at the expense of President Joe Biden. Consequently, legacy news outlets have been publishing snide opinion pieces that openly insult these errant voters. The Los Angeles Times, for example, ran a column last week about a woman named Victoria Thompson who says she may vote for Kennedy. Its author, Mark Z. Barabak, refers to her as “crazy” and “nutty.” He describes her political views as “conspiratorial” and “far-fetched.” And what are those views? She’s been a Democrat most of her life, but doesn’t believe she owes her vote to any party: “As for Biden, she’s convinced — like many Republicans — that he is well past his sell-by date and lacks the mental capacity to be president.” This is nutty? A recent NYT/Siena College poll found that most voters agree. (READ MORE from David Catron: Why Biden Is Bleeding Non-White Voters ) As Niall Stanage writes in The Hill , “Kennedy has some fertile ground to plow among disaffected Democrats, given the widespread concern about Biden’s age and his ability to effectively serve through a second term.” And the number of double dissenters is significant. Catherine Kim points out in Politico that they constitute roughly one-fifth of the electorate. They were a negligible factor in 2020 but in 2016 they made up about 18 percent of the voters, many of whom cast ballots for third-party candidates. As Matthew Xiao reports in the Washington Free Beacon , the Democratic National Committee held a conference call that revealed who the Democrats believe will be the beneficiary of their votes this year. Democrats slammed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he announced Nicole Shanahan as his presidential running mate on Tuesday, with lawmakers expressing worry that the pair’s campaign will siphon votes from President Joe Biden in his rematch this fall with Republican nominee Donald Trump … The DNC hosted the call with several Democratic officials from swing states after Kennedy on Tuesday ramped up his independent White House bid by announcing his running mate would be Shanahan, an attorney who donated $4 million to Kennedy’s campaign for Super Bowl advertising. That Super Bowl ad highlighted one of the most important strengths Shanahan brings to Kennedy’s campaign — money. She is a billionaire who can help cover the costs associated with a multi-front legal war coordinated by the DNC to keep him off state ballots. NBC reports , “The Democratic National Committee is building its first team to counter third-party candidates, while outside groups stockpile money for a wider campaign.” The Kennedy campaign has sued Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, according to a report from Spectrum News . Bellows, who also attempted to keep former President Trump off Maine’s ballot, has also barred Kennedy from collecting the necessary signatures to get on the state’s ballot. (READ MORE: Will the 2024 Election Get Lost in the Mail? ) Kennedy may have to sue the state of Nevada pursuant to his petition to get on its ballot. State officials say it is invalid because it lists no VP candidate. Kennedy’s attorney told CBS News, “After successfully collecting all of the signatures we need in Nevada, the DNC Goon Squad and their lackeys in the Nevada Secretary of State’s office are outright inventing a new requirement for the petition with zero legal basis … The petition does not even have a field for a VP on it.” This collusion between the DNC and Nevada officials suggests that the Biden campaign believes most double dissenters will vote for anyone but the President if they have a choice. A USA Today /Suffolk University poll indicates they may well be right : Twenty-five percent of the double haters supported Trump in the survey, compared to 18% for Biden. About 44% of the double haters currently back various third-party candidates. Kennedy drew more of these voters, 21%, than Biden did. Green Party candidate Jill Stein had the backing of 7% of double haters, while independent Cornel West was supported by 6% … In the 2016 election, Trump performed 17 percentage points better than Hillary Clinton among the double- hater voters — who made up about 20% of the vote — steering him to victory. Assuming these percentages are reasonably accurate, the double dissenters are not merely an important voter bloc, they may well send Trump back to the White House. The corporate media would be wise to stop mocking these voters. Snide columns like the one quoted above from the Los Angeles Times are unlikely to motivate dissident voters to support any candidate offered by the two major parties. Moreover, if the DNC continues its election interference strategy — and that’s the proper definition of its effort to bar Kennedy from state ballots — it will blow up in Biden’s face. If voters like Victoria Thompson are denied the right to vote for the candidate of their choice, they will sit home. That’s just as good as a vote for Trump. (READ MORE: The State of the President ) A majority of the voters are less than enthusiastic about the presidential candidates the two major parties will offer them in November. Most will cast ballots for the least worst of the two. Some will sit home and others will vote for a third-party candidate. If the Democrats and the corporate media continue to deride the latter group, the larger it will become. Insulting the customer is a losing strategy. Please … Please keep doing it for the good of the nation."
"1","I’m tired of hearing political pundits divide our Commonwealth into east and west, urban and rural. We are one Pennsylvania — united — and we will come together to tackle our greatest challenges. — Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro A brief look at a county-by-county political map of the United States reveals an odd duality: The overwhelming amount of land in the country resides in Republican districts, and yet Democrats control much of the government because most of the largest cities are liberal. For a long time now, and yet increasingly, the hyper-urban parts of the country are dictating liberal policies to country folk that inhabit most of the geographical spaces the country owns. Look at examples like the city of Chicago, for instance, and its overwhelming influence on the remainder of the largely rural state of Illinois, or Detroit’s dominance of the massive state that is Michigan, or any number of other examples. In my state of Pennsylvania, Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro urges us to believe that this rural/urban divide isn’t as important as our shared identity. And certainly some research does suggest that the divide looms larger psychologically than in reality; often rural and urban persons share more in common than rumor has it. But while the shared values sentiment is nice, it is nonetheless clearly true that rural voters feel increasingly disconnected from their urban counterparts. No matter how much we talk about unity, it isn’t a mirage that 11 rural Oregon counties voted to join Idaho because they don’t like liberals in Portland telling them what to do. (READ MORE from Lucian G. Conway: The Curious Case of Conservative Happiness ) The depth of the problem is illustrated by simply imagining a hypothetical in my state of Pennsylvania: What if Philadelphia was no longer a part of the state? President Donald Trump lost Pennsylvania in 2020 by over one percentage point. Consider that without only one county — Philadelphia County — in 2020, Trump would have won the state by over six points (52 percent Trump to 46 percent Biden). That’s a larger margin than Trump won in conservative Texas. If one removes the three greater Philadelphia counties as well, Trump wins Pennsylvania by over 13 percent, and if you throw out Pittsburgh, too, Trump wins by almost 19 percent, which is a larger margin than he won in Mississippi. This brief analysis reveals that the increasing divide between rural and urban America is quite real. But why does it exist? Many on the left claim it is because rural voters have lost touch with true American values and are a threat to the American way of life. For example, Tom Schaller , author of White Rural Rage: The Threat to American Democracy, recently said: First of all, [white rural voters] are the most racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay demographic in the country. Second, they’re the most conspiracist group: QAnon support and subscribers, election denialism, Covid denialism and scientific skepticism, Obama birtherism. Third: anti-democratic sentiments. They don’t believe in an independent press, free speech … And fourth: they’re most likely to excuse or justify violence as an acceptable alternative to peaceful public discourse. Research does show that rural voters increasingly resent big-city liberals telling them what to do. But is it because rural voters have become racist, violent, rage-filled authoritarians? That certainly doesn’t describe the people in the rural area where I live. None of those people seem filled with rage; most of them are calm, happy, people who love their neighbors and love democracy. Indeed, a recently published book by Colby College professors tells a different tale than Schaller, one much more in line with the experience of every day rural Americans such as myself. Containing one of the largest studies of rural America to date , the Colby book suggests not that rural voters are rage- filled authoritarians bent on overthrowing democracy, but rather that they have real concerns rooted in reality. In the words of the authors of the study: “One of the reasons it may be hard for Democrats to go into rural areas is that they’ve come to believe these are bastions of crazy Trumpers.… But what we show in this book is that there are genuine concerns that pre-date Donald Trump by decades.” In fact, it is worth considering the division problem the other way around. Tom Schaller’s quote provides a stark contrast to Governor Josh Shapiro’s earlier statement about unity across rural and urban lines. And that highlights part of the problem: It is hard for rural voters to feel much unity when an ever-growing barrage of liberal criticism like White Rural Rage suggests rural folk are threats to democracy on par with terrorist groups. One can’t just declare unity by fiat. Perhaps at least part of the problem with the rural/urban divide is that big city liberals state false facts about rural Americans and then use rural folks’ subsequent dislike of being slandered as evidence that they are “rage-filled.” (READ MORE: Republicans Are Missing the Point of Trump — Again ) This suggests part of the solution, too. No, I’m not sure we should give Philadelphia to New Jersey. But I am sure that liberals shouldn’t describe rural voters who want to do so as hate-filled racist xenophobes."
"1","Step inside the Bishop McCort Catholic High School in Johnstown , Pennsylvania, located almost 70 miles east of Pittsburgh, and there are palpable examples of how faith figures into the educational experience of highly motivated students with ambitions for college. There’s the chapel located right in the center of campus, which serves as the site for masses, prayer services, and alumni reunions. Crucifixes are also prominently displayed in classrooms and administrative offices. Then there is the curriculum, which includes a strong emphasis on theological instruction. But more than anything, it’s the Catholic community itself that includes not just the student body, but parents, teachers, athletic coaches, alumni, scholarship organizations, and average citizens who recognize they all have a stake in creating compelling alternatives to failed public schools. (READ MORE from Kevin Mooney: Is Educational Freedom Poised to Transcend Union Power? ) Bishop McCort draws from 20 school districts with some students doing an hour commute to and from each day. Unlike its government-run counterparts, Bishop McCort remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic and attracted 150 transfer students from districts that were closed. There are currently 248 students in grades 7-12, but the school’s full capacity is 1,000. Escaping the Violence and Finding a Career Path Geographically, two of the students who transferred in this current school year did not have far to travel. The two 16-year-olds, one in the 11 th grade and the other in 10th , previously attended the Greater Johnstown High School within easy walking distance of Bishop McCort. But to hear them tell it, they now occupy a radically different universe from the one they left. “The public school was just a very violent school,” the 11 th grader said. “There were always fights, and it just wasn’t safe. There were fights everywhere, in the hallways, in the bathroom, in the classroom. I would say we have ten times better education here than at Johnstown.” The 10 th grader had many of the same experiences at Johnstown and now finds he is on a more compelling path that could lead to college and a career. “It just seemed like the teachers at Johnstown just didn’t care,” he said. “Every period there were always students in the hallway and it’s so loud.” Both students expressed a strong interest in the sports medicine curriculum at Bishop McCort, which is open to 11 th and 12 th graders. The advancement in medical techniques has helped to open up new career opportunities, they explained. The transfer students are also fans of the 4-day school week Bishop McCort implemented last year with an optional “Friday Enrichment Day.” “I think it works well,” the 11 th -grader said. “I have extra time to study, and the enrichment classes are very worthwhile.” The enrichment period includes SAT prep, tutoring services, science fairs, and college visits. The graduation requirements and expectations are rigorous. Each student must take at least seven periods of classes each semester, including the five core classes in mathematics, science, English, social studies, and theology. The Benefits and Limits of Scholarships Like other private schools across the state, Bishop McCort benefits from a tax credit scholarship program dating back to 2001. While the scholarships continue to have a transformative impact on students and their families, there is a significant gap between supply and demand, Tom Smith, the Bishop McCort principal, laments. “We could fill this school if we didn’t have these arbitrary caps on the scholarship programs,” Smith says. “And I think you would see the Johnstown High School, and others empty out.” Formally known as the Education Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) and Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit (OSTC), these programs put private school tuition within reach of families that could not otherwise afford to attend a school like Bishop McCort. In the 2021-2022 school year, scholarship organizations drawing from both programs delivered 77,640 awards to K-12 students, according to the Commonwealth Foundation, a free market think tank based in Harrisburg that supports school choice. (READ MORE: Pennsylvania: School Choice Proponents Poised to Extend Lifeline Scholarships to Students ) On average, the scholarship amount for EITC was $2,583, and $1,853 for OSTC. Pennsylvania students submitted about 139,000 scholarship applications, but 63,000 student applicants were turned away because of the caps the state legislature has placed on the program. Bishop McCort has awarded financial aid in the form of EITC, endowment money, and names scholarships to 292 students. Scholarship applicants must be below the household income limit of $108,444, plus $19,088 for each dependent. That’s not exactly a problem in Johnstown since it’s been listed as the poorest city in the entire state. But time is a factor for families that stand to benefit from new avenues for education since they have a limited window to alter the trajectory of students trapped in Pennsylvania’s “low achieving schools.” School choice initiatives have made significant, albeit incremental progress, recently. This past December, for instance, Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, signed off on legislation providing a $150 million increase in the scholarship caps. While the increase makes it possible to provide about 35,000 additional scholarships, it is hardly enough to end the student waiting list or keep up with willing donors. Individuals and businesses that can donate have more than 200 scholarship organizations to choose from. In exchange for their donations, they receive a 75 percent (1-year commitment) or 90 percent (2-year commitment) credit against their state income tax. Bishop McCort has a list of individuals and businesses who have supported their students with scholarships. Tuition at Bishop McCort costs $13,000 per student, but the school charges $7,000, and the average scholarship is about $3,000. Smith estimates that about 80 percent of the students receive scholarships. Scholarship Parents Talk Up Benefits Without the EITC program, the affordability of a Catholic education, “would definitely be a struggle,” says Jen Preuss, a scholarship parent with three children attending Bishop McCort. “I have twin boys who are seniors, and my daughter is a sophomore so obviously this is a huge commitment financially,” she says. “But we made the decision that we wanted more out of the education our children were receiving in the public schools and I’m happy we took this leap of faith. I would say to businesses now is the time to donate since the money will be well spent.” Preuss also has a message for elected officials who are in a position to continue expanding the tax credit scholarship programs. “We need to make sure we are investing in our kids in every way possible, because they are our future,” she continued. “There is academic rigor, but also faith- based education that enables students to make good decisions and to be surrounded by other students who are thinking positively about the decisions they make each day. So, it’s not just the academic piece, it’s about the person as a whole and this is what they are getting at Bishop McCort.” Without a Catholic education, Kaitlin Magro doubts very much that her son would be on his way to Brown University and that her other children would advance as much as they have academically. As one of several Bishop McCort alumni who are sending their own children to the school, Magro knows full well what distinguishes Catholic schools from conventional public schools. Her son, currently a junior, and wrestler, has been accepted into Brown based on his grades. She also has a daughter who is a sophomore now interested in pursuing advanced studies. Her other daughter is in the seventh grade and also attends a Catholic school. (READ MORE: Gov. Shapiro, Choose School Choice Over Union Power Grabs ) “Without the scholarships we would be looking at very high prices,” she said. “I had my kids in public schools, but I wanted them in Catholic schools because of the smaller classes and the hands-on instruction. Teachers Celebrate Four-Day Week The teachers themselves have also found that their experiences have been professionally rewarding thanks in part to the environment, but also because of some recent innovations. Lorie Regan is one of those teachers. She’s an English instructor who has been with the school for 33 years. “The four-day week is one of the best moves we have made, and it’s been a fantastic morale booster for students and teachers,” Regan said. “I think in the beginning people were a bit hesitant. But what we took away day wise, we have made up minute wise. In fact, we have extra minutes with the students.” Molly Largent, another English instructor, who is also certified in ESL agrees. Having Fridays open enables her to catch up on grading and get ahead on lesson plans. As a working mother with three children in elementary school, the four-day weeks gives her added flexibility. “I can already see from my lesson plans that I’m already ahead of where I would have been this year thanks to the four-day week,” Largent said. “I also see students taking full advantage the extra day by taking SAT prep classes they would otherwise have to pay for, and tutoring services in any areas that they need.” Largent also has no problem calling out political figures who claim to support students while voting down proposals for increased scholarships. “You can’t say you are in the business of helping kids or looking out for kids if you are keeping them in an environment where they are not able to thrive,” she said. The four-day week is just one small part of a larger plan the principal is considering. Smith, who also serves as the head football coach, has been the school principal for five years, and has just signed another five-year contract. He’s eyeballing a nearby bank building as a potential internet café for online students where the tuition could be less than $2,000 a year. The ace in the hole for prospective students may exist in the form of the proposed “Lifeline Scholarships” offering Education Opportunity Accounts to any student assigned to a district school in the bottom 15 percent of performance based on state testing. The latest version of the lifeline proposal calls for $2,500 for a student in half-day kindergarten, $5,000 for a student in full-day kindergarten through eighth grade, $10,000 for students in grades nine through 12, and $15,000 for special-needs students regardless of their grade. For many students, this would be more than sufficient to cover the cost of Bishop McCort. But ultimately, it falls on lawmakers, including some who have attended Catholic schools such as Bishop McCort, to provide parents with more autonomy over their own tax dollars as they search for alternatives to unsatisfactory public schools.

"1","T he problem when standing on the mountaintop is that you also may be standing at the precipice. That appears to be the situation facing Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping. His word is law, but that leaves him with no one to blame for the plethora of challenges facing his regime. Economic growth has slowed, the real estate market risks collapse, high debts bedevil China’s state banks, corruption continues to undermine military readiness, and Xi has been forced to purge political and military ranks of his own appointees. His tight control over almost every aspect of Chinese life, including the economy, is discouraging domestic entrepreneurship and foreign investment. The People’s Republic of China faces potential demographic collapse , with the population having begun a long and sharp decline. Doubts are growing that the PRC’s economy will ever surpass America’s. Perhaps worst of all, the regime continues its retreat to Maoist tyranny. Political controls have grown stifling. Only Xi’s personal experience with the Cultural Revolution , which convulsed his family as well as the nation, might have prevented the reappearance of the infamous Red Guards, waving books of Xi’s rather than Mao’s sayings. Nevertheless, the insistence that everyone in every endeavor spout Xi-isms has left some liberal-minded Chinese in despair. One told me that once they could look forward to some political change every ten years. No longer. (READ MORE from Doug Bandow: Leftists Blatantly Celebrate Lenin’s Legacy in New Book ) Although Xi might believe himself to be a new god, the influence of previous supreme leaders, including Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, Nicolae Ceausescu, Enver Hoxha , and Saddam Hussein vanished almost overnight on their deaths. Xi’s legacy might disappear equally swiftly. Indeed, his regime’s ruthless repression of religious believers, especially of what Beijing views as “foreign” faiths, suggests that Chinese communism hopes to become theology as well as ideology. Rather than seeking to close all churches, the regime has attempted to absorb them, requiring them to display Xi’s photo and CCP propaganda. The party is even determined to reinterpret if not rewrite the Bible , as presented in China. As such, Xi should consider the fate of Herod Agrippa, as related in Acts 21-23: “Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. They shouted, ‘This is the voice of a god, not of a man.’ Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.” Certainly, religious believers are suffering from increasing persecution. ChinaAid’s latest annual assessment , “ChinaAid’s Annual Persecution Report 2023,” details the Chinese state’s continuing assault on all religions, and particularly Christianity. The organization begins with the regime’s call to Sinicize — in reality communize — religion. For instance, politburo member Shi Taifeng called on the official religious associations “to fully implement the CCP’s theories, principles, and policies regarding religion, adhere to the direction of the Sinicization of Chinese religions, and actively guide religions to adapt to the socialist society of China.” The regime also promoted “faculty reinforcement for Marxist religious studies and research,” which obviously is intended to override personal faith. Moreover, new rules were issued “to regulate the inspection, approval, and registration of religious activity sites, their organization and structure, management of legal obligations.” The CCP detailed a long list of prohibitions, such as holding religious activities outside of religious venues, naming them “after any church, denomination, or person,” and creating “affiliation relationships.” Most formidable is the requirement that practicing believers “endorse the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist system, thoroughly implement Xi Jinping’s thoughts about socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era … practice core socialist values, and adhere to the direction of the Sinicization of Religion.” In other words, abandon their religious beliefs, at least any serious ones. Throughout the year the party went to great effort make churches a de facto subsidiary of the CCP. Little expense was spared in obnoxious propaganda and officious regulation. Significant barriers were created to religious activities, celebrations, and education, as well as youth ministries and evangelism. Activism on behalf of democracy and human rights was punished. However, millions of believers have resisted such efforts, causing the regime to turn to more traditional repression. Among the tactics employed: 1, Destroying churches. For instance, “On the evening of January 11, without an agreed compensation plan, the Ruian county government of Wenzhou city, Zhejiang province, dispatched a large number of SWAT agents to forcibly demolish Nangang Church Feiyun Street, Nangang village, in order to build commercial buildings on its site. The church covered an area of 8 acres and was worth tens of millions of RMB. Two videos of the forced demolition were circulated on the Internet. One of them showed that dozens of police stood fully armed, wearing helmets, masks, police uniforms, and raincoats, confronting Christians attempting to defend the church. The other video showed several police officers surrounding Christians who came to stop the demolition of the church.” 2\. Shutting churches and arresting members. But one example: “In the morning of May 21, joint law enforcement agents stormed Zhongxing Christian Church, a member church of Chinese Evangelical Fellowship in Zhengzhou city led by Pastor Ma Teng. A dozen agents from the Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, and the Urban Management Brigade broke into the church and destroyed personal property. They also issued a notice to ban the church and sealed off its front door. Personal belongings left at the scene by some church members, including an engagement ring, were all stolen.” 3\. Prosecuting lay Christians and church leaders. Age is no obstacle: “Accused of illegally selling lawfully printed Bibles, Wang Honglan of Inner Mongolia’s Hohhot was charged with ‘illegal business operations’ and arrested on April 14, 2021, along with 11 preachers and co- workers. As of the latest, three of them are on bail awaiting trial and nine of them remain in police custody, including Wang Honglan (68 years old; suffers from cerebral infarction, heart disease, adrenal tumor, purpura, kidney stones); Wang’s husband Ji Heying (73 years old); suffering from hypertension and diabetes); Ji Guolong (son of Wang and Ji); Wang Jiale (Wang’s nephew); Liu Wei and his wife 23 Liu Minna (suffers from heart disease), Zhang Wang, Yang Zhijun (his wife Yu Lina was released on bail; they have a child), and Ban Yanhong (63 years old).” 4\. “Disappearing” church personnel. One among many examples of this totalitarian practice is Wang Honglan, “charged with ‘illegal business operations’ and arrested on April 14, 2021, along with 11 preachers and co-workers. As of the latest, three of them are on bail awaiting trial and nine of them remain in police custody, including Wang Honglan (68 years old; suffers from cerebral infarction, heart disease, adrenal tumor, purpura, kidney stones); Wang’s husband Ji Heying (73 years old); suffering from hypertension and diabetes); Ji Guolong (son of Wang and Ji); Wang Jiale (Wang’s nephew); Liu Wei and his wife 23 Liu Minna (suffers from heart disease), Zhang Wang, Yang Zhijun (his wife Yu Lina was released on bail; they have a child), and Ban Yanhong (63 years old).” 5\. Concocting criminal charges against church leaders. Victims of this practice include “Kan Xiaoyong (65 y.o.) and his wife Wang Fengying (63 y.o.) are natives of Wuhan, Hebei province. Kan was a successful businessman before he left his secular career to become a church pastor. In 2018, they established ‘Discipleship Home Fellowship’ online in Liaoning province’s Dalian city. They donated generously to charity and sponsored 100 children with anemia. Wang Fengying had won national awards as a model schoolteacher. She followed her husband to Dalian to help with evangelism.” They were tortured and tried based on the fabricated charges. 6\. Fining churches and members. For instance, “On June 11, the venue rented by a Christian from Shengjia Church in Shunde District, Foshan city, Guangdong province, was raided by Shunde District Public Security, Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau, Street Neighborhood Committee, and other government agencies. They took away some church belongings and asked the members present to make written statements. On August 31, Shunde District Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau issued an ‘Administrative Penalty Decision’ to Preacher Deng Yanxiang, Deacon Zhu Longjiang, and Deacon Wang Weicai who were held at a detention center on the grounds that they organized illegal religious activities in the name of ‘Shengjia Church.’ The Decision also imposed a fine of 4,800 yuan (~$658). On September 1, Shunde District Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau issued an ‘Administrative Penalty Decision’ to Elder Zhu Longfei, who was held at a detention center. For the same reason, a fine of 4,800 yuan was imposed.” 7\. Abusing church leaders. An example is Ru Zongren, who “returned to his hometown to serve as a pastor at Chengxi Christian Church. On May 19, 2015, Ru Zongren’s church was forcibly demolished by the local government. Ru stepped in to defend the church, but was beaten up and injured, which caused kidney failure, so he has to rely on kidney dialysis to sustain his life since then. The local authorities continued to persecute him. In July, 2023, due to the upcoming visit of the Central Government’s Inspection Team to Anhui province, the local government once again arbitrarily detained Ru Zongren. The most outrageous is that when Ru Zongren needed hemodialysis and local government officials had to take him to the hospital for treatment, they kept him handcuffed and shackled, and bound him to the hospital bed for nearly five hours.” 8\. Prohibiting evangelism. Sharing the Gospel is dangerous: “On September 13, Ms. Yan, a staff member of Dao’en Presbyterian Church in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, was summoned by the police for leading street evangelism, and later administratively detained for five days for allegedly ‘organizing an outlawed social group to continue its activities’.” 9\. Harassing and threatening believers. For instance, “Liao Enxin, a young house church pastor in Pingxiang, Jiangxi province in southern China, has been active in evangelism and publishing faith-related articles on the Internet for many years. Some of his articles regarding church and state relations have attracted a great number of readers. As a prominent house church leader in Pingxiang who insists on holding Christian meetings, he has become an eye sore to local authorities. Liao was often summoned by security personnel. In January of this year, local security personnel brought police into his home and asked him to accept their friend request on WeChat (a social media platform) to ‘strengthen ties’.” 10\. Treating religious contributions as criminal fraud. An example was the Wangjia Hunli Church, which in 2016 was raided by the local religious bureau. “Officials confiscated more than 40 computers and 300,000 yuan (~$44,310) from the church, and arrested Pastor Wei Xiaomei, her husband Li Bingxin, and Zhang Tao. Both the couple and Zhang Tao were charged with fraud in 2017, and released on probation in October, 2018. In 2021, however, authorities again imposed multiple administrative penalties on this church, including confiscations, fines, and late payment fees totaling 36 million yuan (~$5,317,200). The church hired a legal team to respond to the lawsuit, and the case went through a trial and administrative reconsideration phase, followed by an administrative litigation request to the Zhuhai Intermediate People’s Court, which still has not gained any progress. On July 7, 2022, the three Christians involved in the case received an ‘administrative compulsion’ letter serving 42 as a reminder and request for them to pay the hefty fine or the court would enforce it.” ChinaAid includes a long list of those who have been tried, currently face charges, or have suffered in other ways. Particularly useful is the report’s review of court cases and publication of names of those arrested and facing trial. Victims deserving attention, protest, and prayer include pastor Lian Changnian, pastor Lian Xuliang, and preacher Fu Juan of Xi’an Church of Abundance; house church evangelist Chen Lijun; three Christian laywomen, Li Bingrong, Huang Qiuyan, and Jie Lihong; pastor Zhou Songlin, elder Ding Zhongfu, preacher Mao Junma, preacher Pei Defei, and church management staff Yang Peiyun; and elder Zhang Chunlei. They should be remembered not only by their Christian brothers and sisters around the world, but also by all who believe in freedom of faith and conscience. Particularly noteworthy is the harassment and prosecution of those associated with the Early Rain Covenant Church: preacher Dai Zhichao, along with many other staffers and members. (READ MORE: Unlikely Persecutor: Japan Threatens to Shut Unification Church ) Also, worth reading is ChinaAid’s companion volume, “Top 10 Persecution Cases in China 2023.” Much shorter than the annual report, this volume details the worst ten Chinese assaults on religious liberty. In China believers face harassment, arrest, torture, and imprisonment. They pay an increasing price for their faith. Ironically, Xi’s attempt to enforce theological conformity to the CCP is likely to backfire. By and large, Chinese Christians are focused on God, not the party, and are seeking to care for their community, not overthrow the state. However, the regime has turned the established political order into something that looks like “the Beast” of Revelation imagery, which only spurs opposition. Denied freedom to live faithful lives, Christians have no choice but to organize and resist. With more Christians than party members in the PRC, repression is more likely to destabilize than strengthen the regime. Xi’s attempt to make the CCP into a substitute deity has failed. Rising popular dissatisfaction has given rise to the “let it rot” and “lying flat” movements, which reject the party’s attempt to determine the purpose of life. For that the Chinese know they must go elsewhere. The more fervently the regime attempts to crush those who look beyond politics for answers, the more likely it will make religious faith their ultimate destination.

"2","Biden is in campaign mode, and the president wants voters to know he understands housing is out of control. Over the last month, Biden has ramped up his bully pulpit focus on the housing crisis. In his State of the Union address, the president pledged new tax credits for first-time homeowners and to “crack down on big landlords” who price-fix rents. His new budget includes proposals to expand vouchers and housing supply, and he gave a second speech promising to “build, build, build” to “bring housing costs down for good.” When the president hit the campaign trail in late March, he dedicated a Las Vegas stop to stumping his affordable housing initiatives, and on Friday his administration even announced it would embrace some new rent control . You don’t have to squint to see how the housing crisis is complicating the otherwise positive economic message the president hopes to sell. Mortgage rates are so high that most homeowners feel they can’t afford to move, and most renters feel priced out of the idea of homeownership altogether. Wages have gone up, but not faster than home-buying costs , and over 22 million households now spend more than a third of their income on rent as of 2022. Inflation and the economy remain the top issues for voters, and economists cite high housing costs as a main culprit for inflation still exceeding the Federal Reserve’s target goal of 2 percent. This is all creating bad vibes, at a time when the president wants to build enthusiasm for a second term. A Redfin-commissioned survey from February found almost two-thirds of homeowners and renters say housing affordability makes them feel negatively about the economy. Politically, the president also has a lot to worry about when it comes to mobilizing the young people and voters of color who helped him eke out a victory in 2020. Polling indicates that it’s these voters — who are more likely to be renters — that Biden is now struggling with: those who cast ballots for him four years ago but are now leaning toward Donald Trump or considering staying home on Election Day. The White House’s “opportunism is finally catching up to them and I say that in a good way,” said Tara Raghuveer, the director of KC Tenants, a tenant union in Kansas City, Missouri. “They know now that what they do needs to feel material to people.” Housing doesn’t typically play a big role in presidential elections given that it’s a difficult issue for the White House to deliver short-term change on, and federal lawmakers more broadly have steered clear of issues like zoning, which largely fall under the purview of state and local governments. That’s starting to change in Washington, though, with both the House and Senate holding more hearings recently on housing affordability than each chamber has in years. Housing costs are generally the biggest bills voters are responsible for, and politicians are realizing they simply can’t ignore it. The president wants housing to be part of “Bidenomics” The Biden administration has talked previously about housing, but it wasn’t an issue that stayed particularly high on the crowded legislative agenda. It fell out of the president’s $2 trillion Build Back Better package, and Biden rarely gave any speeches on the topic. In 2022, his team did put out the Housing Supply Action Plan , a grab bag of proposals that the White House called “the most comprehensive all of government effort to close the housing supply shortfall in history.” But housing advocates critiqued the administration for failing to really lead bipartisan housing negotiations in Congress, for not fighting hard for housing money in competitive spending bills, and for not working closely enough with the private sector to bring down construction costs . (Daniel Hornung, deputy director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told Vox they discuss housing often and it’s “part of almost every economic conversation we have with members of Congress.”) In promoting his economic agenda in the summer of 2023, in what would become known as “ Bidenomics ,” the president emphasized three main planks: empowering workers, reviving domestic manufacturing, and reining in corporate power through competition. Housing wasn’t much part of that conversation, but the White House is trying to change that now. In a newly released report , the president’s staff economists dedicated an entire chapter to increasing the supply of affordable housing and called for more aggressive federal action to lower costs, like pressuring cities to loosen zoning laws. For now, the president’s $258 billion housing proposals seem geared toward the election, elevating more popular issues like junk fees and rent gouging. Biden also proposed new tax credits for first-time homebuyers and for middle-class families selling their starter homes, and a new $20 billion grant program to increase housing production. And rather than running on a universal expansion of housing vouchers to all eligible renters, as he did in 2020 , the president is now proposing an expansion of housing vouchers to more politically popular groups — low-income veterans and youth aging out of the foster care system. Some conservatives criticized Biden’s plan on the basis that the proposals would actually make things worse if supply didn’t also significantly increase. “Biden’s backwards solution is to subsidize demand by handing out more government money to buyers, renters, and developers,” argued Judge Glock, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a right- leaning think tank. It will be hard to make a real federal dent on housing without Congress, and it’s unlikely that any major congressional action will happen before the next election, with Republicans loathe to give Biden any more bipartisan victories to campaign on. While the House of Representatives did authorize a meaningful increase to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program in January , that package looks increasingly dead in the Senate. Experts say the expiring Trump tax cuts in December 2025 look like the next big likely opportunity for new housing spending. Until then, the president needs to walk a tight line between elevating the housing crisis and not polarizing it. The pro-housing “Yes in My Backyard” movement has been successful so far largely by building bipartisan coalitions . Perhaps the biggest shift is really in the White House’s willingness to focus on the plight of renters, something tenant advocates say took years to finally see. “In the summer 2022, when inflation was really bad and the biggest driving factors were shelter and gas, the Biden administration never uttered the word ‘rent,’” Raghuveer said. “Two years later, they are talking about rent gouging and about exactly the policy solutions we’ve been proposing since 2020, including conditions for federal subsidies, tax credits, and financing. The bar is really low but we’re breaking new ground.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Layla Ahmed is, by any measure, a responsible adult. She works at a nonprofit in Nashville helping refugees. Makes 50k a year. Saves money. Pays her bills on time. But there’s another measure of adulthood that has so far eluded her. Ahmed, 23, moved back in with her parents after graduating college in 2022. “There is a perception that those who live with their parents into their 20s are either bums or people who are not hard-working,” she told the Today, Explained podcast. Being neither of those things, Ahmed and her situation actually point to a growing trend in America right now: More adults, especially younger adults, are either moving back in with family or never leaving at all. According to the Pew Research Center, a quarter of all adults ages 25 to 34 now live in a multigenerational living situation (which it defines as a household with two or more adult generations). It’s a number that’s been creeping upward since the early ‘70s but has swung up precipitously in the last 15 years. The decennial US Census measures multigenerational living slightly differently (three or more generations living together), but the trend still checks out. From 2010 to 2020, there was a nearly 18 percent increase in the number of multigenerational households . The research arm of the apartment listing and resident services company RentCafe went granular on Gen Z and found that 68 percent over the age of 18 still live with a parent or parents . As for millennials, 20 percent are back with mom and/or dad (or just never left). Given the bum stigma (to paraphrase Layla Ahmed), what’s going on here? What’s driving this? When Pew recently surveyed people living in multigenerational homes, more of them said financial issues drove the decision to move in with family than any other reason. Which: Yes. Total student loan debt has ticked slightly down in the past few years but not by much. Meanwhile, inflation. You may have heard of her . And, oh yeah, home affordability last fall was the lowest it had been since the ‘80s . “I think it’s a contemporary trend, whether it’s to be able to save the money to buy a home, to be able to go back for a master’s degree or to be able to do something to further their ability as independent adults,” said Donna Butts, executive director of Generations United , a nonprofit that researches and advocates for multigenerational households. Major macro disruptions — financial or otherwise — often lead to spikes in multigenerational living: “We’ve seen the largest increases when our country has had a recession or a housing bust and then Covid,” Butts said. “But what people are surprised by is they always think that the numbers are going to decrease again.” Masks off, goodbye Mom and Dad?

Subscribe The census found that there was a dip in younger adults living with parents after a spike at the height of the pandemic. But the dip was pretty shallow. Which means many people moved in and just never left. Amid skyrocketing costs and labor shortages in care work at either end of life have also pulled people into multigenerational housing. Nearly a third of people surveyed by Pew said caregiving — child, elder, or otherwise — was the primary reason they lived in a multigenerational situation. One more reason multigenerational housing is on the rise: America is getting less white . Hispanic and Asian people, especially if they are immigrants, are more likely to live with extended family . Black families are also traditionally more open to these arrangements. In many cultures around the world , multigenerational living — at least until marriage, and often even after — is the norm, not the exception. Getty Images Given some of these factors driving the increase, I suppose it’s not surprising to see the way polling shakes out when it comes to these living situations. Overall, a little more than a third of Americans say this trend is “bad for society” (ouch), per Pew’s research. But white people are more likely to say it’s bad news (41 percent) than Black people (26 percent), Hispanic people (28 percent), or Asian people (23 percent). Men find it more objectionable than women, older people are less on board, and Republicans are the least into this of any group measured. Dave Ramsey fits a few of the above categories. White dude; baby boomer. Definitely conservative, though he’s not much for party politics. He is also perhaps the most popular personal finance personality in America , preaching a gospel of aggressive saving, home ownership, and freedom from debt (besides a modest mortgage). Ramsey told Today, Explained on a recent visit to his studio, “It’s not a kid that’s a college graduate with a degree in logistics that has the ability to make 120k. He’s not living in his daddy’s basement, okay? It’s career choice and direction.” But Ramsey loosened up a bit when asked about the potential for an adult living with parents to pay down debt. He said that if giving up autonomy temporarily means getting very real about paying off debt, “Sure. Have at it. I’m in.” Butts points out, though, that multigenerational living used to be pretty common before World War II — and for decades before that. It was after the war when people got in cars, got jobs in suburbs, and bought homes with more space for fewer people. Nuclear families. By 1960, a new norm had entered the chat. The vast majority of adults were peacing out from mom and dad’s and not looking back. “And we then said that was the way that people should live, that they should be independent, that we don’t need each other — when in fact we do need each other,” she said. That includes for things like caregiving, staving off loneliness, and helping out (collectively) with the bills. Pooling resources is also better for the climate, she said. “We need to realize that it’s not a matter of us going back. It’s a matter of us going forward to something that is better and healthier for many families.” Additional reporting by Noel King and Amanda Lewellyn.

"2","Lead keeps showing up where it’s not supposed to be. In 2024, one of the most potent neurotoxins known to humanity persists all over the world as a public health threat. For the second time in six months, lead contamination in food products has put public health authorities on high alert in the wealthiest nation in the world. Last fall, contaminated cinnamon-applesauce pouches caused dozens of lead poisoning cases across the US, eventually prompting recalls in November. And in March, the federal government announced that some ground cinnamon products also contained slightly elevated levels of lead and advised customers not to buy them. Lead might seem like something we left behind in a past era. By the 1990s, nearly every country had eliminated leaded gasoline, once easily the most ubiquitous source of lead pollution when we spewed it into the open air. The US and Europe also instituted more stringent rules for another common source of exposure, lead paint, by greatly restricting or outright banning its use. You can see the improvements in the numbers: From 1978 to 1991, the average level of lead in the blood for Americans younger than 75 dropped by 78 percent. But lead usage has actually been on the rise worldwide, even in the US. The proliferation of lead-acid batteries globally and less stringent rules in the developing world for everything from cookware to spices has allowed lead consumption to grow despite its known health risks. Lead is linked to a wide range of neurological and development problems, and exposure is especially dangerous for children. Research has found kids with elevated levels of lead in their blood experience a range of effects, from speech and hearing problems to learning and behavioral issues. They develop more slowly, physically and mentally. And it remains an especially serious plight for poorer countries: A 2021 review of studies involving children in 34 low- and middle-income countries found that 48.5 percent had elevated levels of lead in their blood. But in a globalized economy , some of the same lead pollution endangering kids in those countries can find its way into consumer products that travel around the world and contaminate the food that children in the US eat. In the case of the applesauce, the cinnamon was originally harvested in Sri Lanka and then shipped to Ecuador, where it was ground into powder to be mixed into the products. Both countries are dealing with lead exposure crises: One 2021 study found that almost all mothers and children living in Quito, Ecuador, had levels of lead and other metals in their blood that exceeded public health guidelines. The pollution stemming from Sri Lanka’s active lead-acid battery manufacturing and recycling sector, too, has created health problems for the workers and people who live near the plants. When the applesauce ingredients passed through Ecuador, they were contaminated there with lead before they moved for sale to the US, where there have been more than 500 confirmed or suspected cases of acute lead poisoning related to the recalled products. The FDA believes the lead may have been added intentionally for economic reasons. The Ecuadorian government has named one individual as a suspect in its own investigation. Contaminated applesauce pouches have been linked to more than 500 confirmed or suspected cases of lead poisoning in the US. Matt Ramey/Washington Post via Getty Images The entire episode encapsulates the difficult truth about lead: Even though the US has cracked down within its borders, pollution elsewhere persists — and, in some cases, American efforts to reduce its own pollution merely moved the contamination to other parts of the world. “So much of the food that we eat is coming from all over the world,” said Stephen Luby, who studies lead pollution at Stanford University. “So we are deluding ourselves if we think we can push pollution problems to low-­income countries and not worry about it.” It will take a multifaceted, multilateral, multinational strategy to eradicate lead contamination. And it starts with recognizing the whole world is in it together. We keep finding lead everywhere we look Lead exposure can be either high-grade (which can lead to acute poisoning and, in rare cases, even death) or low-grade (which can still result in developmental and cardiovascular problems). The amount of lead in the cinnamon that was used in the applesauce pouches was enormous, with a concentration of more than 5,000 parts per million. That is thousands of times higher than the amount public health experts consider to be acceptable and high enough to cause acute lead poisoning. The ground cinnamon the FDA warned about in March, by contrast, contained 2.03 to 3.4 parts per million . Although that amount is unlikely to result in an immediate ER visit, experts emphasize that no level of lead exposure is considered safe. Even these trace amounts could contribute to health problems over the long term when added to other exposures. “We want to eliminate all exposures, don’t get me wrong, but I think that’s a very different situation with those much, much lower levels,” said Perry Gottesfeld, executive director of Occupational Knowledge International, an advocacy group focused on public health and industrial pollution. One of the fundamental challenges in eradicating lead is that pollution can be low-grade and long-running. The lead that crept into our environment during the era of leaded gasoline and lead paint is still in the soil. Even pots and pans made from recycled aluminum that was mixed with leaded products or ceramics covered with a lead-based glaze ( the kind used and traded around the world ) can contribute over time to higher levels of lead in a person’s blood through degradation or exposure to heat. “It’s always been there, to be honest. From a basic level, since industrialization, lead has been there,” said Jenna Forsyth , a research scientist at Stanford who works with Luby on lead research. “Lately, there’s been a closer inspection. And the more we look, the more lead we will find.” A recent analysis from the environmental group Pure Earth examined more than 5,000 samples of consumer products in 25 low- and middle-income countries, ranging from foods and spices to cosmetics and toys to cookware and paints. It found that 18 percent of all samples had dangerous amounts of lead, based on reference levels drawn from public health agency guidelines. About half of all of the ceramic and metallic foodware and 41 percent of the residential and commercial paints tested had excess amounts of lead. The US food supply relies on imports from countries with high levels of lead exposure, according to a 2019 report from the same group. The United States imports nearly all of its spices, coffee, and cocoa , for example. Independent tests conducted from 2014 to 2018 found most of the chocolate products tested — 96 out of 127 — had amounts of lead and cadmium (another dangerous neurotoxin) higher than the levels allowed in California, according to the Pure Earth report. The US also imports about half of all fruits and vegetables consumed here. Farmers in lower-income countries must sometimes rely on untreated industrial wastewater to irrigate their crops, which can then contaminate the produce that is shipped around the world. Once lead finds its way inside a person’s body, it quickly enters the bones because of its molecular similarities to calcium. It then subsists for decades, moving around and finding easy access to important organs, including the brain. And as lead takes up residence in places where calcium is supposed to be, it disrupts important biological and neurological functions. “Lead is a toxin like no other,” Luby said. ‘People think about ‘Oh, yeah. Lead’s bad. Mercury’s bad. Cadmium’s bad. Air pollution is bad. All these things.’ No — lead is really disproportionately bad.” A Peruvian child with lead poisoning exercises his facial muscles with the help of his mother. Jaime Razuri/AFP via Getty Images One global estimate of lead’s impact concluded that exposure had contributed to 5.5 million adult cardiovascular deaths and $6 trillion in lost economic potential in 2019. “But we don’t see lead. We don’t think about it,” Luby said. “When Dad dies of a heart attack, we don’t blame it on lead.” Three reasons for continued lead contamination We’re all at risk from lead — but not at equal risk. Children in low- and middle-income countries have average blood lead levels roughly three times higher than those in high-income countries, based on the available national data. While one in three children worldwide have dangerously high amounts of lead in their blood, the share is closer to one in every two children in the developing world. Lead-battery manufacturing and recycling in lower-income countries where plants are subject to less regulation can lead to local pollution. There are fewer restrictions on lead in paint and other everyday products (food included) in the developing world. And, as mentioned, exposure also comes through agricultural practices. In the US, besides food imports, deterioration of aging civil infrastructure contributes to exposure, as was the case with lead-leaching water pipes in Flint, Michigan. Lead ammunition, commonplace in the US, has also been linked to elevated lead levels in children’s blood. Lead’s persistence, unfortunately, is multifaceted. Drew McCartor, executive director of Pure Earth, put the sources into three buckets. First, some polluters actively disregard the rules around lead use and its known health effects and intentionally continue to use lead in their products. Spices are a good example of how this can happen: Lead chromate pigment is often used to produce a more vibrant color in spices such as cinnamon and turmeric. Forsyth, in her work with Luby to address lead exposure linked to turmeric among rural mothers in Bangladesh, noted that the use of lead chromate is “economically motivated.” It adds the yellow color desirable in traditional turmeric. It is also denser than the spice itself and reduces the amount of time it takes to process the turmeric’s roots, which increases the producer’s yield. The FDA has said it is investigating whether the presence of lead found in the cinnamon-flavored applesauce pouches was the result of such practices. Companies have proven adept at migrating their operations to less restrictive jurisdictions. That’s a particular problem for lead acid batteries, which are most commonly used for automobiles and represent about 85 percent of lead’s use in the modern global economy. Most lead batteries are recycled to make new ones, but lead recycling has been linked again and again to the contamination of nearby soil and water. The US sends most of its used car batteries to Mexico to be recycled, and the towns there that are home to recycling plants have been found to have extremely high lead levels . “You look at the history of battery recycling in the US, which is basically closed down and overwhelmingly moved to places where there’s weaker environmental regulation,” Forsyth said. “We in the wealthy world are like, ‘Oh, yeah, I want cheap batteries.’ And the fact that it’s killing people nearby in another country is a connection we don’t make.” The second source of contamination is negligence, when companies fail to address lead levels that do not exceed regulations but still present a risk. A toy manufacturer that doesn’t test its raw materials for lead or a food maker who doesn’t perform due diligence on their suppliers may not be intentionally contributing to lead pollution, but their lackadaisical attitude allows lead to continue moving through the economy, where it ends up exposing consumers, including children. Last, there are the legacy sources of lead, the result of our overdependence on the material in the decades before we realized how dangerous it was. Lead was added to gasoline as an anti-knocking agent to improve the performance of automobiles’ combustion engines. By burning leaded gas, humans pumped lead into the atmosphere for decades; the US did not completely phase it out until 1996 . That lead eventually settled into the soil, where it is difficult and expensive to remove. It’s the same story with leaded paint: The paint chips and slowly erodes, creating lead-laden dust that finds its way into the soil or the water supply. Commonly used pesticides have likewise left lead behind in the ground where they were sprayed. And lead used in other products is likely to be around for years in one form or another, creating more and more of those small-scale exposures that add up over time. The longtime use of lead in paint and gas has created pollution that is still with us decades later. Barbara Haddock Taylor/Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service via Getty Images “Lead is introduced into the material stream and then stays in that material stream as it’s reused for different purposes,” McCartor said. “These are usually small­-scale producers. So I wouldn’t describe them as irresponsible. They don’t have the means to test for lead. They are certainly not introducing it, I don’t think, intentionally. But it’s a product of our longstanding use of lead in the world.” How do we get rid of all this lead? The solution starts with the right policies — including prohibitions on the most potent sources of lead exposure — but it doesn’t end there. The experts I spoke to said national governments could be more aggressive about cracking down on common sources of lead exposure. Lead paint, for example, is still widely used around the world. Even in the US, where its use is restricted for residential use, industrial use is fair game. More than 120 countries voted symbolically in 2009 to phase out lead paint, but there has been little action since. Following through on that commitment would be one place to start. Environmental activists also advocate for prohibiting the lead chromates that are added to spices for appearance and weight, the suspected source of the recent lead scares in the US. Given the outsize role of lead batteries in lead pollution, they are also necessary targets for change. But this presents an enormous economic challenge: These batteries are ubiquitous — used “in every electric vehicle , in every solar household, in every cellphone tower,” as Gottesfeld put it — and their alternatives have struggled to gain a market share. Lithium-ion batteries are the most common option, but they’re more expensive for manufacturers (and therefore, ultimately, the consumers) and present their own recycling challenges. Still, experts say the world must keep working to reduce lead use and thereby exposure. Action by wealthy nations can create incubators for new alternative technologies as well as set an example for the rest of the world. “When you look at the amount of human harm from all of this, it makes more sense for us to just move to substitutes and literally get this toxin out of the economy,” Forsyth told me. “I think that high­-income countries would be a great place to start. Because if they did this, they would both reduce their own risks and they would also clarify technologies and ways forward.” But the right policies are insufficient. We also need more government attention and resources dedicated to the problem. Removing lead from the soil has been chronically underfunded, even in the US, and the FDA’s negligence on the food side of its “food and drug” portfolio has been well documented . Monitoring of lead levels in food being imported to the US is minimal. That leaves America vulnerable to the weaknesses in other countries’ regulatory infrastructures, which are poorly funded and less robust. In Mexico, although the pollution from lead battery recycling plants has raised the local lead levels above the country’s threshold for intervention, there has been little effort by the government to crack down on the industry. The tainted cinnamon that passed through Ecuador before ending up in applesauce pouches sold in US stores should have been subject to the country’s existing lead pollution laws, but oversight has stayed lax because of a lack of resources. “Having the policy in place wasn’t enough. It wasn’t being enforced,” Forsyth said. There are pockets of progress, as with Bangladesh and turmeric. McCartor said he’s been encouraged by a lead eradication campaign in Ghana, where his group collaborated with the national government to survey children for lead levels in their blood and to identify the likely sources of pollution. The survey found that lead recycling plants were major contributors, much as they are in Mexico. So Ghana decided to shut down two of three lead recycling plants within its borders. “We cannot inspect our way out of this problem. You could spend a fortune in perpetuity and only catch a tiny fraction of contaminated goods coming into the United States,” McCartor said. “If we really want to solve this, it requires a whole-­of-­government commitment to work outside of our borders.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","I n the 1950s and 1960s, 98 percent of Americans believed in God. Now, according to Gallup, just 74 percent do. This would seem to represent the advancement of the forces of reason over the forces of faith — except Americans did not stop believing in things beyond sensory perception when they stopped believing in God. This article is taken from The American Spectator’ s latest print magazine. Subscribe to receive the entire magazine. A YouGov survey reports that 57 percent of Americans believe in aliens, 31 percent believe in Bigfoot, and 18 percent believe in the Chupacabra. (You might not believe in the Chupacabra, but the Chupacabra believes in you.) Match.com found that 46 percent of singles believe in astrological compatibility, up from 32 percent in 2022. Any Pisces mismatched with an Aries without first consulting the stars could tell you the wisdom of always asking, “What’s your sign?” The decline in belief in God is but one metric that shows a collapse in religious faith. Just 43 percent of Americans now report attending a religious service a few times a year, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. Americans notice immigration altering their country. Unnoticed goes the more profound, unrelated trend of a churchgoing people becoming nothingarians and worshippers of the Sunday morning crossword puzzle. “When men choose not to believe in God, they do not thereafter believe in nothing,” G.K. Chesterton famously observed. “They then become capable of believing in anything.” The aphorism finds 2024 affirmation in the fact that politics has become the de facto religion for those who no longer subscribe to religion. The Church of St. Progress, though lacking a god, a hereafter, and much else that is positive in traditional churches, registers high in terms of fanaticism, sins, heretics, apostates, excommunication, catechesis, devils, and, especially, scolds. No longer finding meaning in religion, they have made a religion of their politics. At its worst, at least in North America, this all-consuming political mindset jails political opponents, takes away the livelihoods of comedians who unveil the wrong punchlines, and rewards not excellence but obedience to prevailing dogma. In more subtle ways, revealed by public polling but rarely in any convincing way in everyday life, the congregants of the Church of St. Progress advertise their intolerance. A year after the last presidential election, a Generation Lab/ Axios poll of college students demonstrated a massive intolerance gap between the parties. Democrats were far more likely to refuse to shop at a business (71 percent to 31 percent), date (41 percent to 7 percent), or befriend (37 percent to 5 percent) someone who voted for the opposing candidate than were Republicans. A Harvard Business Review study of managers and MBA students found that describing a company’s values as conservative led to respondents being 26 percent less likely to buy its products and 44 percent less likely to apply for a job there. Conversely, describing a company’s values as liberal led to no change among respondents. The authors described the bias as “entirely driven by participants who identified as Democrats.” Art by Bill Wilson One finds the Nicene Creed of this irreligious religion on lawns in leafy suburbs. “In this house,” one line of it proclaims, “we believe science is real.” This means microbes would represent life on Mars, but a fully formed baby inside her mother does not constitute it; a college athlete with Barney Fife’s Adam’s apple, Richard Kiel’s voice, and John Holmes’s penis amounts to a woman just as much as does Lana Del Rey or Mikaela Shiffrin; and eleven-year-olds must take the shot just because. The lab coat takes the place of the collar in conveying authority. Science, a tool to inquire, becomes a cudgel to silence once it is religionized. “To rely on the evidence of the senses and of reason is heresy and treason,” social philosopher Eric Hoffer observed of such people in The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements . “It is startling to realize how much unbelief is necessary to make belief possible. What we know as blind faith is sustained by innumerable unbeliefs.” We live in the era of unbelief. So thoroughly does it overtake those who show themselves to be “capable of believing in anything” that they insist they take nothing on faith, except, perhaps, their lack of skepticism of their own skepticism.

"2","Giddy up! Cowboy Carter , Beyoncé’s eighth studio album and long-awaited sequel to Renaissance , dropped on March 29. Notable collaborators include musicians like Linda Martell, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Miley Cyrus, Post Malone, and many others . Earlier this year, Beyoncé made history as the first Black woman to top Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart with “Texas Hold ‘Em,” the album’s lead single. As senior correspondent Alex Abad-Santos writes , “Not unlike how Renaissance highlighted the history of people of color helping to create and perpetuate house music, Cowboy Carter offers up the same opportunity for mainstream culture to acknowledge just how much country music owes its sound and history to Black artists.” So, from country music’s Black roots to how the CMAs might have inspired the album, read on to understand more of Beyoncé and Cowboy Carter’s cultural significance and why the conversations about who defines a genre matter."
"2","J.K. Rowling’s supporters frequently claim the author has never actually said or done anything transphobic. It’s a position you can see on social media, in the pages of the New York Times , and even on a new podcast with Rowling herself. It’s also an easily debunked lie. Some of this confusion around Rowling’s opinions can be cleared up with a definition of transphobia , which doesn’t — despite the “phobia” — solely mean fear of trans people, but, per Merriam-Webster, also an “irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against transgender people.” (In fact, Merriam-Webster’s own examples list cites multiple articles related to Rowling.) Rowling can say she likes everyone, but she has displayed that prejudice time and again. She’s also peddled explicit fear of trans people, particularly trans women, insisting they’re an inherently dangerous threat to cisgender women. Although some in the media distort the anger directed at Rowling from trans activists, trans people, and allies, the truth is those feelings — not just anger, but betrayal and grief — are justified. Rowling has made her antagonistic position on trans issues clear through tweets, sound bites, actions, and even a 3,600-word blog post . By 2024, her transphobia has become so rampant and constant that it’s difficult to build a completely comprehensive timeline of it. For those attuned to it, she doesn’t have to spell it out every single time; it’s a huge part of her identity. These dog whistles only lead to more confusion, however, allowing people to point to the absence of immediately obvious bigotry to claim she’s being unfairly maligned. Additionally, she increasingly threatens detractors with legal action , which contributes to critics of her behavior falling silent . Conspicuously, many of her legal threats appear to be directed at individuals identifying as part of the LGBTQ+ community. Since Rowling began airing her views, her community, especially online where many of these conversations are had, is now stacked with similarly minded people who share her transphobic beliefs. For instance, Rowling is friends with numerous anti-trans activists, including Helen Joyce, who’s made alarmingly transphobic statements calling for a “reduction” in the number of trans people. She’s tweeted public support for anti-gay , anti-trans activist Caroline Farrow . These connections are part of a social network echo chamber of trans- exclusionary radical feminists, or TERFs (sometimes called “radfems” or the “gender-critical” movement). In Rowling’s native UK, TERFism has gained a unique stronghold over some particularly vocal, ostensibly liberal feminists like Rowling. Related Trans people deserve better journalism The facts we can easily point to suggest that Rowling has been turning toward an anti-trans stance over a long period, beginning mostly with simple engagement on social media and leading to fiery and extremist statements. While labeling something transphobic is a serious accusation, and not something we do lightly, it’s important to recognize Rowling’s bigotry for what it is. The rundown that follows shows her growing embrace of transphobic, even extremist rhetoric. 2014: Rowling writes The Silkworm , the second novel in the Cormoran Strike mystery series, which involves a trans woman who is portrayed as conspicuous and unable to pass . The book includes a scene where the main character gleefully threatens this character with prison rape. October 2017: Rowling “likes” a tweet linking to a controversial, since-deleted Medium article referring to a theoretical trans woman in a female space as “a stranger with a penis.” While liking a tweet might seem small, this is notable because the piece made the basic argument Rowling continues to make today, namely that trans women are by default part of a “male-bodied” group who are dangerous to women and who should not have access to women’s bathrooms . In the public sphere, this kicks off questions about whether Rowling is anti-trans, which are followed by the author entrenching further. JK Rowling hitting that like button on a ""trans women are rapists"" piece, if you were wondering whether to relax as a trans person in the UK pic.twitter.com/W5JvBmylPW — Shin Ultratran (@sistersinead) October 24, 2017 ​​2018: In March, Rowling “ likes” (and then unlikes) a tweet referring to trans women as “men in dresses” and implying that trans rights are “misogyny.” A JKR spokesperson later claims that this “like” was an accident and that Rowling was having “a middle-aged moment.” Wingardium transphobia @jk_rowling pic.twitter.com/s6cJ2rIr6A — Philip J. Ellis (@Philip_Ellis) March 21, 2018 In September, Rowling “ likes” a tweet linking to an opinion column by known TERF Janice Turner , which argues yet again that trans women are inherently sexual predators, referring to them as “fox[es] in a henhouse ... identify[ing] as [hens].” The myth that trans women are a danger to cis women is a grossly transphobic stereotype with almost no real-world justification , but Rowling pins most of her anti-trans arguments on it, using her experience as a survivor of domestic abuse to justify her prejudice. December 2019: In a shift toward openly voicing her anti-trans sentiments, Rowling vocally supports the plaintiff of an employment discrimination suit in the UK. Maya Forstater became a cause célèbre in the TERF community after suing the company that chose not to renew her contract. In 2018, Forstater posted numerous anti-trans tweets , both generalizing about trans people and directly targeting one nonbinary person. The tweets made staff members at her company uncomfortable, and ultimately, in March 2019, the organization declined to renew Forstater’s contract. Rowling’s tweet , in which she distorts trans identity and the facts of the case, marks the first time many people become aware of her growing transphobic tendencies. June 2020: In a tweet, Rowling mocks the trans-inclusive phrase “people who menstruate” in an article about pandemic menstrual health, implying that the phrase, meant to encompass trans men and nonbinary people, erases, overrides, or obscures the word “women.” In a follow-up to the previous tweet and the backlash it spawned, Rowling posts a thread implying that trans activists are “erasing the concept of [biological] sex” and along with it “the lived reality of women.” She also states, “I’d march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans.” (To date, she has not.) Days later, Rowling produces her most overt and lengthy discussion of her views, a 3,600-word manifesto published on her website responding to “the new trans activism.” The post is replete with myths and false transphobic stereotypes, particularly revolving around the narratives that gender and biology are inextricable and that trans women are dangerous. Rowling states the movement offers “cover to predators”. She also repeatedly amplifies the alarmist, false idea that teens are transitioning as part of a social media trend, a claim based on a handful of inaccurate and shady scientific studies claiming that an outsize number of trans teens will detransition later, studies that have since been widely debunked . August 2020: After the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization issues a statement repudiating her transphobia, Rowling doubles down on her position and returns an award given to her by the org in 2019. September 2020: Rowling releases the Cormoran Strike book Troubled Blood and is widely criticized after she creates a villain who preys on women by wearing women’s clothes. This is exactly the specter of a sexual predator that Rowling believes hides behind the label of “trans woman.” Trans rights banners call out J.K. Rowling during anti-government protests in Bangkok, Thailand. Lauren DeCicca/Getty Images December 2020: In an interview with Good Housekeeping, Rowling claims that “90 percent” of Harry Potter fans secretly agree with her anti-trans views, but that “many are afraid to speak up because they fear for their jobs and even for their personal safety.” This once again stereotypes trans activists as an angry, entitled, and vicious mob. July 2021: Rowling tweets a screenshot of a tiny account — reportedly with around 200 followers at the time — of a self-identified trans user who mentions her in a tweet discussing gender identity . Since Rowling did not remove the trans user’s information in the screenshot that went out to her 14 million followers, that user is subsequently inundated with transphobic harassment and ultimately deletes their Twitter account. November 2021: Rowling publicizes that a group of three trans people shared a photo of themselves holding protest signs outside of her house, saying that she had called the police out of alarm (a fact Scottish police also verified). Rowling claims that these protesters had “doxxed” her, and the media runs with this report, which plays into the larger evolving media narrative of Rowling as a victim of trans harassment. But as many people have pointed out , Rowling’s address is publicly known — so well- known, in fact, that it is a frequent fan tour stop. Police later officially state there is “ no criminality ” in what the trans protesters had done. As trans culture vlogger Jessie Earl points out , trans people themselves are at much higher risk of experiencing doxxing, bullying, and harassment than cisgender people. Earl also notes that Rowling has supported and platformed (through Twitter likes, follows, and retweets) multiple TERFs who had themselves doxxed other people, including Marion Millar, who faced criminal charges for homophobically doxxing a police officer (though those charges were dropped pending review ); Rosie Duffield, an MP who drew criticism for “ publicly outing ” a staff member who resigned over her transphobia; and Rosa Freedman, a professor who doxxed a student who emailed her requesting a chat about her views on trans equality. “War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength. The Penised Individual Who Raped You Is a Woman.” December 2021: Rowling shares a Sunday Times article that mocks the Scottish police for recognizing transgender identity. In her tweet , she parodies 1984 , writing, “War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength. The Penised Individual Who Raped You Is a Woman.” Later that month, in the middle of a thread ostensibly attempting to support trans equality, Rowling tweets , “The question at the heart of this debate is whether sex or gender identity should form the basis of decisions on safeguarding, provision of services, sporting categories and other areas where women and girls currently have legal rights and protections.” The idea behind what Rowling is saying is that allowing trans women equal access to those spaces will erode current legal rights for cisgender women and girls. This is a position that only makes sense if you are denying that trans women and girls are women and girls. Rowling then adds an insistence on separating “sex” from “gender,” an essentialist idea that contradicts current medical practice and scientific research, which advocates for treating gender identity as linked primarily to the brain , not anatomy. March 2022: In response to a since-deleted tweet (which was itself a reply to a tweet in which Rowling implied trans women were “predators”), Rowling tweets about a sexual assault committed by a trans woman, using this single incident to imply that all trans women should be denied access to public spaces designated for women. The next day, on International Women’s Day, Rowling posts a series of tweets maligning gender-inclusive language and mockingly referencing Voldemort by sarcastically opining that the day in future would be known as “She Who Must Not Be Named Day.” She also explicitly criticizes gender-inclusive legislation. Later that month, British lawyer Alison Bailey partially wins an employment discrimination lawsuit in which she claimed that she was discriminated against because of her gender-essentialist views. While the lawsuit was in progress, Rowling posted a tweet urging her followers to financially support Bailey. August 2022: Rowling’s latest Cormoran Strike book, The Ink Black Heart , once again comes under fire for transphobia because of its depiction of a character broadly viewable as a satirical stand-in for Rowling herself — an anti-trans public figure who is “canceled” by the internet on trumped-up charges of transphobia and then killed. December 2022: Rowling screencaps a thread about the controversial new Hogwarts Legacy video game by the aforementioned popular transgender YouTuber Jessie Earl, a.k.a. Jessie Gender. Earl points out that supporting the franchise would “justify her continued targeting of trans people”; Rowling, in response, sarcastically accuses Earl of practicing “purethink,” implying trans advocacy is a type of religious dogma. An onslaught of transphobic social media harassment targeting Earl follows. Since JK Rowling retweeted me with an honestly nonsensical argument; I’m gonna stay off the Musk app today cause she knows she’s sending harassment my way. I send you all love & this article with my thoughts on Rowling continued harm against trans people. https://t.co/MJ9yizkCcM https://t.co/7NfYMVr65i — Jessie Earl (@jessiegender) December 17, 2022 This month, Rowling also personally funds a new domestic violence support center in Edinburgh, Scotland, which explicitly excludes trans women ; Rowling frames this new center as offering “women-centered and women-delivered care.” Edinburgh’s longstanding domestic violence support center has had a trans woman as its director since 2021. Trans women, in particular women of color, are at a vastly higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and sexual assault than cisgender women. January 2023: Rowling tweets that she is “Deeply amused by those telling me I’ve lost their admiration due to the disrespect I show violent, duplicitous rapists.” The most immediate context for this comment is presumably both the backlash to Hogwarts Legacy and the ongoing backlash over Rowling’s views writ large regarding trans women being dangerous predators. So a reasonable implication of Rowling’s words seems to be that she considers trans women, by default, to be “violent, duplicitous rapists.” March 2023: A new podcast , The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling , produced by Bari Weiss’s The Free Press and hosted by prominent former Westboro Baptist Church member Megan Phelps-Roper, featured interviews with Rowling. In its fifth episode , Rowling begins discussing the modern trans rights movement, calling it “a cultural movement that was illiberal in its methods and questionable in its ideas” and insisting, “I believe, absolutely, that there is something dangerous about this movement and that it must be challenged.” She then compares the movement to Death Eaters — the villainous supremacists in her books, analogous to Nazis: [S]ome of you have not understood the books. The Death Eaters claimed, “We have been made to live in secret, and now is our time, and any who stand in our way must be destroyed. If you disagree with us, you must die.” They demonized and dehumanized those who were not like them. I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement, that has gained huge purchase in very influential areas of society. I do not see this particular movement as either benign or powerless, so I’m afraid I stand with the women who are fighting to be heard against threats of loss of livelihood and threats to their safety. While Rowling can say she only intends to target the specific trans activists who are angry at her, that’s an impossible distinction. She does not mention any formal group or entity that represents trans rights that has acted against her. The only context we have for what she is responding to are non-affiliated individuals on Twitter sending angry messages in response to her transphobic comments. Indeed, the episode is titled “The Tweets” and features Phelps-Roper reading angry and sad tweets from former fans of Rowling. This generalization doesn’t distinguish “the movement” from people who are simply angry and upset with Rowling. Instead, it seems to imply that “good” trans people are the ones who accept Rowling’s version of their identity and allow her viewpoint — that they aren’t who they say they are — to dominate their fight for social acceptance. Trans people are estimated to comprise about half a percent of populations in both the US and the UK . A 2018 study from UCLA found no evidence to support that anti-trans legislation makes designated public spaces safer, but did find that “reports of privacy and safety violations in these places are exceedingly rare.” In essence, there was no danger to begin with. March 2024: On March 13, Rowling appears to deny on X (formerly Twitter) that trans people were targeted during the Holocaust. This all started when Rowling retweeted a post by James Esses about having been “canceled.” Esses is a blogger and former student who was fired from his counseling job and expelled from his therapy degree program for his anti-trans campaigning. Esses’s post claimed he was fired for opposing the use of puberty blockers for trans children. In the threads of Esses’s post, in response to one of his supporters but also copying both Esses and Rowling, a Twitter user responded with, “The Nazis burnt books on trans healthcare and research, why are you so desperate to uphold their ideology around gender?” Rowling then takes this tweet and screencaps it, asking , “I just… how? How did you type this out and press send without thinking ‘I should maybe check my source for this, because it might’ve been a fever dream’?” The literal burning by Nazis of books and research from Berlin’s pioneering Institute for Sexual Research , which conducted the world’s first gender-affirming surgeries for trans people, was captured in German newsreels at the time and has been well-documented since, including by the UK’s own Holocaust Memorial Day Trust . Calling this very well-sourced history a “fever dream” quickly drew significant backlash from Twitter users, with many framing it as a form of Holocaust denial. When challenged on her claim with multiple sources by Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic instructor Alejandra Caraballo, Rowling first responds that the original tweet had made claims it didn’t say: that the Nazis burnt all research on trans health care, and that trans people were the first victims of the Nazis. Rowling then doubles down on Twitter, by quote tweeting another tweet claiming trans people were not targets of the Nazis during the Holocaust. In her quote, Rowling frames the verified history of Nazi violence toward trans people as “persistent claims.” She then, again in response to Caraballo’s pushback in reply, attempts to separate “trans-identifying people” from “gay people, who were indeed victims of heinous treatment by the Nazis.” Caraballo’s reply , which cited sources including Scientific American , and a thorough accounting by a historian about the ways trans people faced persecution under Nazi Germany, did not receive a rejoinder from Rowling. April 2024: On April 1, 2024, Rowling posted a thread on X pegged to the implementation of the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act, which added “threatening or abusive behaviour which is intended to stir up hatred” around a number of identities, including age, religion, and transgender identity to the hate crimes statute; the law does not, somewhat controversially, include hatred of women . In her posts, Rowling spotlit a number of women, from a handful of convicted or reported sex offenders to UN appointees Katie Neeves and Munroe Bergdorf as well as Mridul Wadhwa, head of a Scottish rape crisis center. All of the women Rowling listed are reportedly trans — leading the author to write , “Obviously, the people mentioned in the above tweets aren’t women at all, but men, every last one of them.” Rowling ended the thread with the hashtag #ArrestMe.

"1","A s former President Ronald Reagan might say, there they go again. Over there at Fox News is this headline: MSNBC host angrily throws her script during show in reaction to Trump calling out judge’s daughter Trump suggested Judge Merchan was kowtowing to his daughter’s interests as a Democratic political consultant The story reports: MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace angrily threw her script off to the side during her live show on Friday while discussing former President Trump’s calling out a judge’s daughter on social media . “So, you know, it’s time to do something different,” Wallace said as she tossed her script to the side. “Like, we’re not going to have this conversation again! I have come on the air with breaking news about requests for gag orders because of threats for judges and their kids more times than I could count today before I got ready.” Wallace, who was joined by former federal Judge Michael Luttig, MSNBC’s John Heilman, Lisa Rubin and Glenn Kirschner, raged at the former president and said he enlisted the “highest court in the land” to delay “every federal criminal trial.” “Donald Trump brazenly and repeatedly attacks not just judges,” she said. “Judges don’t have Secret Service protecting them.” … “We all have to understand that from the first time that the former president began his attacks — vicious attacks — on the federal courts and the state courts and their judges, his objective was to delegitimize those courts so that when and if they ruled against him in the various matters that he’s been charged with, then at least his followers, if not a good part of the nation, would dismiss those rulings against him as having been politically inspired and motivated,” he said…. Manhattan prosecutors asked a judge to clarify a gag order on Friday imposed on Trump following social media posts by the former commander-in-chief that criticized the judge’s daughter. Got that? Wallace and Luttig are infuriated because Donald Trump attacked the daughter of a federal judge ruling on one of his cases. The cause: the daughter’s decidedly far-left, anti-Trump political activism. (READ MORE: The Corporate Media Mocks ‘Double Haters’ ) Might we talk selective outrage? Who, exactly, set the precedent for calling out the family members of judges because of their political activism? Can anyone say “Ginni Thomas”? Here is a headline from the New York Times back there in 2022: Justice Thomas Ruled on Election Cases. Should His Wife’s Texts Have Stopped Him? The nature of the text messages was enough to require recusal, legal experts said. But the Supreme Court has traditionally left such decisions to the discretion of the justice in question. The story reported: WASHINGTON — The disclosure that Virginia Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, had sent a barrage of text messages to the Trump White House urging efforts to overturn the 2020 election brought into sharp focus the conflict of interest her political activism has created — and the lack of a clear-cut remedy. It is one thing, experts in legal ethics said on Friday, for the spouse of a Supreme Court justice to express political views, even ones shot through with wild conspiracy theories. That may not by itself require the justice’s recusal from cases touching on those views. But the text messages from Ms. Thomas, a longtime conservative activist who goes by Ginni, revealed something quite different and deeply troubling, experts said. The messages from Ms. Thomas to Mark Meadows , President Donald J. Trump’s chief of staff, sent during and just after the fraught weeks between the 2020 presidential election and the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, demonstrated that she was an active participant in shaping the legal effort to overturn the election. In other words? In other words, it’s A-OK to attack a Supreme Court justice and his family because of conservative political activism — Justice Thomas’ wife in this instance. But if former President Trump takes a page from the Left’s playbook and calls out the far- left activism of a judge’s daughter — a judge sitting on his case — than woe betide the world. The utter hypocrisy involved in all this from MSNBC’s Wallace and Judge Luttig is enough to swallow the Grand Canyon. Each has done more in their respective fields to thoroughly discredit the media — in Wallace’s case — and the federal judiciary — in Luttig’s case — then most of their peers combined. They have become vivid symbols of the problems in their professions. Shameful. But don’t expect a single thing to be done about it. Like, say, being fired from MSNBC à la Ronna McDaniel or expelled from the Supreme Court Bar and losing the license to practice law, as done to Trump attorney John Eastman. The Establishment lives by different rules. And because they don’t live by the old-fashioned rules of integrity and fairness? That means nothing. Not a fireable offense. Got it."
"1","I have been dealing with certain health matters the past two months, so have been a bit absent from these pages. But the news of Pres. Biden’s Easter sacrilege, coming on top of the outrageously disgraceful performances these past two weeks by New York Sen. Charles Schumer and some Hollywood guy who got awarded for making yet another movie leveraging the Holocaust — this one, a Holocaust movie bereft of Jews — and then leveraged the Six Million to “refute” his Judaism and Israel, brings me to the keyboard to discuss apostasy. I have much to say below about my own religious community’s shameful apostates, but I also wonder about others. Biden proclaims himself a devout Catholic. Nancy Pelosi often began her political comments with the words “ As a Catholic …” And, “As A Catholic,” both Biden and Pelosi — and a massive host of other public Democrat Catholics — promote and have legalized abortion on demand, gay marriage, transgender human-torso sabotage, secular anti- religiosity, and so much more that flies in the face of the Catholic Church’s teachings. Nor is it only Biden and Pelosi but one prominent Catholic lawmaker after another: former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Secretary of State John Kerry, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Tim Kaine, Texas Rep. Robert (“Beto”) O’Rourke, Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, Sen. Dick Durbin, the Kennedy family of Massachusetts, Sen. Patty Murray, Sen. Ed Markey, Sen. Jack Reed, Sen. Bob Menendez, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, dozens of pro-abortion House members like Ted Lieu of California, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and just so many others among American leftist celebrities, entertainers, and media personalities. (READ MORE from Dov Fischer: Catching Up on More Infuriating Things in the Past Month’s News ) As a Jew who is asked about George Soros, Ben and Jerry, Bernie Sanders, Schumer, and other despicable apostates, I likewise ask: what’s with that ? Or why did America’s most conservative voting bloc of all — White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Southerners — continually elect exclusively Democrats, only Democrats, nothing but Democrats, to the United States Senate and their respective governors’ mansions for 120 years from 1860-1980? I have posted this list on these pages before . During the Civil War, Lincoln and the Republicans wanted to end slavery, while the Democrats and their Ku Klux Klan wanted to preserve slavery. As a result, understandably, the South became uniformly Democrat in the 1860s. However, as another four score and seven more years passed, and then decades more, Deep South Christian conservative loyalty to Democrats made no sense. The Democrats had abandoned them and became the party of the Left, while the Republicans had become the party of social conservatism and religious faith. The Deep South was socially, culturally, religiously, and politically conservative — the Christian “Bible Belt.” Yet, incomprehensibly , Dixiecrats still ruled the South for 125 consecutive years as Southern White Protestant conservatives kept electing only Democrats until the 1980s. As a representative “snapshot,” consider these unfathomable results listing all the key statewide winners in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana through 40 years from the 1940s and through the entire decade of the 1970s: Alabama : Gov. Frank Dixon Gov. Chauncey Sparks Gov. Jim Folsom Gov. Gordon Persons Gov. Jim Folsom Gov. John Malcolm Patterson Gov. George Wallace Gov. Lurleen Wallace Gov. Albert Brewer Gov. George Wallace Gov. Fob James Gov. George Wallace Sen. John H. Bankhead II Sen. George Swift Sen. John Sparkman Sen. Howard Heflin Sen. J. Lister Hill Sen. James Allen Sen. Maryon Pittman Allen Sen. Donald Stewart Mississippi: Gov. Paul B. Johnson, Sr. Gov. Dennis Murphree Gov. Thomas Bailey Gov. Fielding Wright Gov. Hugh White Gov. James Coleman Gov. Ross Barnett Gov. Paul B. Johnson, Jr. Gov. John Bell Williams Gov. William Waller Gov. Cliff Finch Gov. William Winter Gov. William Aillain Gov. Ray Mabus Sen. Theodore Bilbo Sen. James Eastland Sen. Wall Doxey Sen. John Stennis Sen. James Eastland Louisiana : Gov. Sam Jones Gov. Jimmie Davis Gov. Earl Long Gov. Robert Kennon Gov. Earl Long Gov. Jimmie Davis Gov. John McKeithen Gov. Edwin Edwards Sen. William Feazell Sen. Russell B. Long Sen. Allen Ellender Sen. Elaine Edwards Sen. J. Bennett Johnston There were approximately 50 statewide winners for governor or United States senator in deeply red conservative White Protestant Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana during the 40 years and more between 1940 and 1980. (Some, like the Wallaces of Alabama, won more than once, as they returned from enforced hiatus after being temporarily “termed out.”) Of those 50 elected statewide in the Deep Red South, all but one were Democrats . (READ MORE: Catching Up on 10 Infuriating Things in the Past Month’s News ) So none of this makes sense , and yet it makes perfect sense. Once a demographic attaches to a party, it sticks to it like barnacles. I do not feel comfortable, as an Orthodox rabbi, overly commenting and opining theologically on the rot that finds the Biden White House declaring Easter Sunday “Transgender Day of Visibility.” I am disgusted by it, and I deeply empathize with my American brothers and sisters of the Catholic faith whose holiest day has been thus desecrated at the highest echelon of government. I know what it has felt like for Jews to wake up on Yom Kippur (1973) or the Shabbat of Shmini Atzeret (last October 7) to learn that Israel has been sucker-punched by war on those holiest of days. I can only imagine what it would feel like if Israelis would wake up on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur to learn the incomprehensible — that the Prime Minister has declared Yom Kippur day to be Transgender Day of Visibility. I can assert without the slightest doubt that the reigning government would fall that very day before the fast even would have ended and the shofar been sounded to mark the conclusion of the Day of Atonement. If I were an American Catholic leader, I suppose I would declare Monday a day of national fasting and mourning. But that is not my place. Instead, I address the matter of my own community’s apostates. Bernie Sanders is a communist. I am not calling him a pejorative. That simply is what he is. He has excluded himself from Judaism. He associates warmly with Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and other anti-Semites of their ilk. It is what it is. I have written about him here . I also have written about Schumer , warning years ago that he is an ethnic Jew but godless. He is affiliated with a “reform Judaism” temple whose rabbi, Rachel Timoner , is an ultra-woke lesbian, conducted the lesbian marriage of Schumer’s daughter , and other Schumer life-cycle events. As reported by investigative journalist Daniel Greenfield: “Rachel Timoner is an activist with such anti-Israel groups as J Street and T’ruah and she co-founded the New York Jewish Agenda leftist organization alongside Sharon Kleinbaum who faced an exodus from her ‘temple’ after saying Kaddish for Hamas terrorists with a mission of fighting the city’s Orthodox Jews.” Schumer manipulates the accident of his Jewish birth for political value. As a Brooklyn politician, he needed to be a Jew to climb the first baby steps up the ladder of political cronyism in his ethnic enclave. So he succeeded Stephen Solarz, of Syrian Jewish heritage, to the New York State Assembly and then Elizabeth Holtzman to Congress when she vacated her seat to seek the U.S. Senate. In time, he used that same Jewish ethnicity to garner Jewish votes from New York Jews when he sought his U.S. Senate seat. He came up with a false campaign line, saying that “Schumer” is a name that sounds like the Hebrew word for “Guardian”: “ Shomer .” And he told his pro- Israel Jewish electorate that’s what he is: Schumer the Shomer Yisrael — the Guardian of Israel. The Bible, in the Psalms of David, tells all who know its contents that there is but One Shomer Yisrael , but One Guardian of Israel: “Behold, the Guardian of Israel [G-d Almig-ty] neither slumbers nor sleeps.” Psalm 121:4. But what of the surname “Schumer”? What, then, does “Schumer” mean? From Ancestry.com : Schumer Name Meaning Swiss German: probably an occupational name for a dairy man from his activity of milking cows which produces foam from Middle High German schūm German Schaum . North German ( Schümer ): nickname from Middle Low German schumer ‘ good-for-nothing vagabond’ . North German ( Schümer ): habitational name for someone from Schümm in Rhineland. (Italics added) Source: Dictionary of American Family Names 2nd edition, 2022. Good-For-Nothing Vagabond. We report; you decide. (Please note: I never comment on people’s names, but this Phony Baloney has made a public career off mistranslating that name.) So what is with Jews like Charles, the Good-For-Nothing-Vagabond, and that other fellow who made that practically judenrein Holocaust movie that is now outside my zone of interest? The truth and reality is that, like most stereotypes, facts often conflict with assumptions. Jews all over the world actually tend toward conservatism because authentic Judaism inclines that way. Jews in the United Kingdom overwhelmingly have been voting Conservative over Labor. Jews in the former Soviet Union helped bring down Communism by fleeing from the U.S.S.R.; those millions are the most anti-Communist people in the world. And the country most associated with Jews — Israel — is regularly panned by America’s leftist media for being “ extreme right-wing .” So it turns out that America is the outlier when it comes to Jews. But, first, don’t forget that Mark Levin is a proud Jew. And Dennis Prager. And Ben Shapiro. And Michael Savage. And the 1,000 synagogues of the Orthodox Union. And the 150 synagogues of the National Council of Young Israel. And the 2,500 rabbis of the Coalition for Jewish Values. And the 1,000 rabbis of the Rabbinical Alliance of America. And all the others whose press releases the leftist mainstream media blackout. But, still, what about the apostates? There is much to say, more for a book than an article. But we begin with reflecting on the tragic mistake of the Republican Party of a century past, when the 3.25 million Jews who comprise more than 90 percent of American Jewry arrived here from Eastern Europe. The Democrats welcomed the immigrants with open arms, as Democrats do when more sophisticated Americanized voters abandon them, and the ultra-snooty white- shoe crowd of Republicans barred Jews from their hotels and country clubs, barred Jewish attorneys from their law firms, and barred Jewish doctors from admittance to practice in hospitals. So Jews lined up as Democrats. Makes perfect sense . And once that happened, Jews behaved exactly as did American White Anglo-Saxon Southern Christians, attached to a political party like barnacles even though that party long since abandoned them while the other party opened its doors warmly. And so we see the Jewish move beginning to the GOP, just as it took 120 years in Dixie for the Bible Belt to get the memo. Orthodox Jews voted for Trump by 83-14 percent in 2020. A Pew study confirmed that Orthodox Jews register as Republican over Democrat by 75-20 percent. The Orthodox community is the harbinger of the rest because the non-Orthodox fall off and disappear within a generation or two. (READ MORE: Cut Off the UNRWA) There is one more thing. Jews like Charles the Good-for-Nothing-Vagabond Guardian and that guy who directed that Holocaust movie outside my zone of interest are caught in a bind. So are Bernie Sanders and Ben and Jerry. They are Jewish. Everyone around them knows they are Jewish. They waited too long to dissociate publicly. But they want so much to fit in with their woke progressive friends. Movie directors need to be woke to win Hollywood awards or even just to get funding. Schumer needs to be as far left as possible to hold his seat as chief Senate Democrat. At this late stage of his public career he cannot hide that he is Jewish. And he knows that the likes of Dick Durbin are only a step away from taking the reins from him if he is “too Jewish,” too pro-Israel in a party that is in turmoil, where maniacs are throwing around words like “genocide” as though it were a card game or a TV show without any regard to the definition. So people like Schumer and the Hollywood apostate will do what they will to downplay and negate their Jewishness, whether by “refuting” their Judaism or demanding of Israel what they never would demand of any other country on earth: that the voters in a democracy allied with the United States tear down their freely duly elected government and force new elections. In this era when being Jewish is not an attractive birthmark in the intersectionalist world of the Left, Jewish does not resonate with the assemblage of The Oppressed: BIPOCs, LGBTQIAs, Muslims, Aborigines, Albinos, the Squad. So, even if Vladimir Putin should not interfere with our elections, nor should China and TikTok, Schumer would insert himself from the Senate floor into Israel’s Knesset. For Jews who desperately want to be loved by their woke Hollywood colleagues or find acceptance in academia among the “From the River to the Sea” crowd, but who cannot deny they are Jewish, their only escape valve is to attack all other Jews — the 95 percent-plus who know that Zionism is part of Judaism — by saying: “You see? I’m not one of them. I’m different. Accept me as one of you. I refute them. I call on them to overthrow their duly elected government.” But it never works. It didn’t work for Trotsky. It won’t work for Kamala Harris’s husband, whose daughter publicly denies being a Jew and is a hero among the anti-Israel crowd . It won’t work for the Holocaust movie guy, no matter what he “refutes.” And it won’t work for The Vagabond.

"1","Critics of House Speaker Mike Johnson’s recent $1.2 trillion funding package have compared Congress to a drunken sailor, which is an insult to intoxicated swabbies everywhere. After all, they stop spending once they burn through their earnings. The U.S. government however has easy access to credit and therefore spends wildly in excess of its income. The numbers should be sobering for anyone not working on Capitol Hill. According to the Congressional Budget Office, we are likely to add $1.6 trillion to our national debt this year. Our debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 120 percent, a level not seen since the end of the Second World War. Bear in mind, as recently as 1990, our debt was about 50 percent of GDP. This is roughly where it was in 1940, when we had the fiscal space urgently needed to defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan simultaneously. That space is now gone, blown away by bi- partisan tsunami of deficit spending, just as the possibility of expanded conflict in both Europe and the Pacific looms larger with each passing month. Wars are hideously expensive; it is always more prudent to spend on effective deterrence to prevent them. Yet the U.S. may not have the fiscal space to maintain our existing military commitments around the world, much less bolster them. To match the Chinese fleet will require us to add over 100 ships; to support Ukraine and our NATO allies will require untold billions as well as more manpower and hardware devoted to a potential land war in Europe. (READ MORE from Karl Pfefferkorn: The US and Gaza Mission Creep ) Can we deter major wars given our parlous finances? Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen writes in the Wall Street Journal that “ the West needs a war footing ” but such a massive industrial transformation also requires massive levels of government spending. The customary answer in Congress is to borrow the funds needed, but we are approaching the end of our ability to borrow at preferential rates. Demand for U.S. bonds is already softening amid the recent flood of new debt. Buyers will soon demand higher interest rates, which makes additional spending more expensive and eventually unsustainable. Any attempt to inflate away our debts will only exacerbate this trend as well as wreck the domestic business climate. Productive investment ceases if returns cannot be calculated because of rampant price inflation. See Argentina or Venezuela for the end point of this particular policy. Creating the long term fiscal space for a “war footing” will require a combination of spending cuts and higher taxes. Raising income taxes is anathema to the average Congressman staring down an election never more than two years away. Cutting benefits is equally fraught. Washington has never in this century asked Americans to pay taxes equal to the government spending we enjoy; we get our government at a discount to its actual cost. The difference is cheerfully shifted by Congress into the future, onto the shoulders of the young and the not yet born. Reversing this convenient practice and compelling Americans to pay more for reduced benefits so that we may devote their tax dollars to the deterrence of a notional attack on our allies is far beyond the political powers of our current leaders. Absent a highly persuasive leader intent on altering this trajectory, we will continue to live beyond our means until the bond market tells us we cannot. At which point America’s reign as the dominant superpower will end. You may reasonably imagine that our adversaries have already sized up this quandary facing American policy-makers. Military strength derives from the fiscal capacity of the state, and ours is approaching its limits. Unlike President Xi and Putin , we do not enjoy an authoritarian’s power to extract funding for military adventures without democratic opposition. Would Americans sacrifice their Social Security, their Medicare, or their Obamacare subsidies in order to defend Taiwan or the Baltic states? The current difficulty getting Ukrainian aid through the House of Representatives suggests they wouldn’t. We may already be at the budgetary limits of our global military presence even before we impose the demands of a “war footing.” Reducing our commitments to align them with our fiscal prospects may be done intelligently through greater burden sharing with our allies in Europe and the Pacific. Or it may be done catastrophically, with allies abandoned. A populist moment coupled with a budgetary crisis could enshrine American isolationism as our prevailing foreign policy. Defending granny’s Social Security from budget cuts is much easier than defending Filipino fishermen from the Chinese Navy. (RELATED: The Heartbreak of the Brideshead Republicans ) It will be easy to decry the coming of populist isolationism as the work of small-minded opportunists. But any success this movement has in reshaping America’s global commitments will derive from the consistent failure of our elected representatives to guard our fiscal strength. Over the past 25 years, we have accumulated debts comparable in GDP terms to those needed to fight the Second World War. But unlike our 1945 predecessors, we have no victory in sight. Our adversaries await, and anticipate what may well be an unavoidable contraction of American power."
"1","Even with U.S. healthcare having the “most unfilled jobs of any industry,” the Biden administration is touting the highest “healthcare job growth in 32 years .” Job growth is always a good thing, or is it? Consider who benefits when the commercial workforce grows. Three groups gain from such expansion: workers, consumers (also called customers, end-users, or patients), and the nation. Hot-stock NVIDIA provides a useful demonstration. The company was founded in 1993 to bring 3D graphics to video games and the multimedia market. In the late 2000s, NVIDIA decided to leverage their coding expertise to become first-to-market leader in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. NVIDIA expanded its workforce creating a number of new jobs. (READ MORE from Deane Waldman: Medicaid Enrollees: The State Can Take Your House ) First, the new NVIDIA workers gain pride-of-employment as well as money. As a result of workers doing their jobs, consumers or in NVIDIA’s case end-users, gain value: they now have the advantages of AI in activities from purchasing and communication to decision-making in general as well as in military functions. All this commercial activity and consumerism increases Gross Domestic Product. National productivity goes up. Does the same happen when healthcare jobs are created? It depends on the type of jobs created: clinical (doctors, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, aides etc.) or non-clinical (bureaucrats, administrators, rules, regulations, compliance, oversight, mandates, and enforcement, also known as BARRCOME). A study of healthcare job growth from 1970 through 2009 shows the types of jobs that grew. The supply of physicians doubled, a 100 percent increase. Over the same time period, the number of healthcare administrators (non-clinical jobs) increased by more than 3,200 percent. In a sense, for every one new doctor, there were 32 new bureaucrats. Over the four decades, U.S. spending on its healthcare system increased by more than 2,400 percent. The study cited above ended in 2010. It did not include effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed in 2010 but not implemented until 2014. The ACA greatly expanded healthcare non-clinical jobs at a cost of $1.76 trillion added to the national debt. In 2023, the U.S. expended $4.5 trillion on its healthcare system, an amount greater than the entire GDP of Germany. Approximately half (!) of all U.S. healthcare spending went to pay for non-clinical jobs, which are paid first. What is left after bureaucrats are paid goes to pay providers. In other words, the healthcare system diverted two trillion “healthcare” dollars away from patient care. As the government expands the non-clinical workforce, more healthcare dollars are diverted from care providers to pay for government bureaucrats and insurance profits . Less money for care means less access to care. So as the healthcare workforce expands, the end-users in healthcare — patients — experience reduced ability to get the care they need when they need it. For the last four decades, Washington has been spending money at a faster rate than growth of GDP (Table 1). Much of this profligate spending went to healthcare, as evidenced by $4.5 trillion just on healthcare in 2023. This $4.5 trillion represented more than five times what was spent on national defense ($858 billion) in 2023. In 1982, the U.S. for the first time had a national debt slightly more than $1 trillion, which was less than a third of GDP. It took 26 years for debt to exceed $10 trillion (2008) when debt was two thirds of GDP . Only nine years later, debt was slightly more than$20 trillion and debt was now greater — 102.6 percent — than GDP. Over the past six years, debt growth continued to outpace productivity, one definition of over-spending, with debt currently exceeding GDP (120 percent). The U.S. is spending itself into the poorhouse. A large portion of this over-spending can be attributed to the expansion of the healthcare bureaucracy. This has badly damaged our ability to respond to national security needs such as China’s surging arms buildup and the collapse of our borders. In addition, this over-spending is dollar inefficient — it does not pay for what medical care is intended to do: provide care. (READ MORE: Insuring Illegals Takes Care from ‘Legals’ ) Job creation in the expanding non-clinical healthcare bureaucracy is damaging to patients and to the country.

"1","W e already knew that the Joe Biden administration was anti-Christian. After this past weekend, there can be no doubt. Biden falsely calls himself a Catholic. He might have come up in the Church, but he doesn’t believe the things Catholics believe. He was denied Communion in 2019 by a brave priest who recognized that no politician claiming to be Catholic can said to be sincere if that politician supports unlimited abortion — as Joe Biden does. Biden’s response — or one of them, following his inauguration as president — was to sic the FBI on Catholics who attend Latin Mass. The Biden administration is a Xerox copy, if not a full-on reproduction, of the Obama administration to which Biden was attached as vice president. And the Obama administration was the most anti-Christian presidential administration America had ever seen. If you don’t believe me, I suggest you pick up a copy of Racism, Revenge and Ruin: It’s All Obama , my latest political book, and read the entire chapter that catalogs the litany of attacks on Christianity and Christian Americans that Team Obama executed over the course of those eight years. But in all of those blows Obama landed on the Christian faith, never was there such an open insult leveled against American Christians than what Joe Biden did on Friday. I’m speaking of this: A Proclamation on Transgender Day of Visibility, 2024… I am proud that my Administration has stood for justice from the start, working to ensure that the LGBTQI+ community can live openly, in safety, with dignity and respect. I am proud to have appointed transgender leaders to my Administration and to have ended the ban on transgender Americans serving openly in our military…. Transgender Americans are part of the fabric of our Nation. Whether serving their communities or in the military, raising families or running businesses, they help America thrive. They deserve, and are entitled to, the same rights and freedoms as every other American, including the most fundamental freedom to be their true selves. But extremists are proposing hundreds of hateful laws that target and terrify transgender kids and their families — silencing teachers; banning books; and even threatening parents, doctors, and nurses with prison for helping parents get care for their children. These bills attack our most basic American values: the freedom to be yourself, the freedom to make your own health care decisions, and even the right to raise your own child…. At the same time, my Administration is working to stop the bullying and harassment of transgender children and their families…. Today, we send a message to all transgender Americans: You are loved. You are heard. You are understood. You belong. You are America, and my entire Administration and I have your back. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2024 [formerly known as Easter Sunday], as Transgender Day of Visibility. I call upon all Americans to join us in lifting up the lives and voices of transgender people throughout our Nation and to work toward eliminating violence and discrimination based on gender identity. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty- ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- eighth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. He actually did that. He appropriated Easter Sunday, the holiest of holy days in the Christian calendar, to glorify transgenderism. Which is about as close to the opposite of worship as anyone can get. Transgenderism is the belief that one can literally change from male to female, or vice versa, through the force of will, drugs, and surgery. It is a denial of the most basic truth in existence — that we are as God has made us. Transgender people believe that God was wrong (for the sake of argument, as most of them don’t believe in God at all) and that they can perfect God’s mistakes. This is categorically un-Christian. Anti-Christian. And it’s Team Biden’s choice to glorify such wicked, horrid, blasphemous beliefs on Easter Sunday. This shouldn’t just be one more irritation borne by the American people at the hands of the cultural Marxist activists populating Biden’s inner circle. It has to be recognized for what it is. A declaration of war against Christians. You do not celebrate transgenderism on Easter Sunday by accident. This administration is staffed by incompetents, but no one is that incompetent. This is the same administration, after all, that appointed Richard “Rachel” Levine, a man in a dress who looks nothing like a woman, to the second-highest position in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Levine caused the death of several thousand people as the head of the Health Department in Pennsylvania’s state government by inserting COVID patients into nursing homes; by any basic analysis, he would have been found wholly unqualified for the position to which Biden appointed him even without the obvious disqualification — his open transvestitism. But Levine’s open transvestitism was the reason he was appointed. Just as another open transvestite, the hilariously nefarious Sam Brinton, was put in charge of America’s stockpile of nuclear material. Brinton was clearly unfit for his position, a fact that became clear when he was repeatedly caught stealing women’s luggage from airport carousels in a pot-luck effort at shopping. This should have been a major embarrassment for the Biden administration, but it didn’t even move the needle. Why? Because the outrage is a feature , not a bug. It’s a signal that Team Biden rejects your Christian morality and societal values and now openly seeks to replace them with … something else. They won’t tell you quite what that is, but it’s pretty obvious what’s in store. For Christians, it starts with your surrender. You are to surrender all of the most important elements of living by your faith. You must embrace the LGBTQ+ agenda in all of its dysfunction and histrionic nonsense — at your job, at your children’s public school, on your television set, in the news you consume, even in the advertising you’re subjected to. You’re not to criticize it on social media, on pain of cancellation and ostracism. Even at your church you’re to forget that bizarre sexual lifestyles are a sin as the Bible clearly teaches, and you are to apologize for the bigotry the Bible has taught you about those lifestyles. And when you’ve done these things you’ll wake up one morning and realize that you aren’t a Christian, because you’ve been turned away from the truth. You won’t find God; you’ll find government — and the people running that government are not, and have never been, interested in truth. They’re interested in power. They’re interested in the power to make you do, believe, say, and act however it pleases them for you to do, believe, say, and act. There’s a very interesting show on Netflix right now. It’s called 3 Body Problem , and it’s a sci-fi epic about a race of highly evolved aliens whose planet is destroyed and who have chosen to come to occupy our world thanks to an invitation by a Chinese scientist horrified by the barbarity of our society. The scientist is the daughter in this, the opening scene from the series: That was Mao’s Cultural Revolution, summed up in three minutes. And it is exactly what the people who make up Team Biden want to do to you if you’re an American Christian. It’s coming. They’ve already started, in little bits and pieces you aren’t supposed to notice. They showed you this in technicolor over the weekend when they took the holiest day of the year and gave it to the most profound rejecters of your beliefs. Less than a year after the Nashville shooter made that crystal clear to anyone willing to see it. And to top it off, Team Biden forbade any religious expression by any of the kids invited to its annual Easter Egg Roll, a secularization of the holiday with nothing to do with Christ’s rising from the dead. And just to top that all off, here was Biden’s “Easter” message to America: Jill and I send our warmest wishes to Christians around the world celebrating the power of hope and the promise of Christ’s Resurrection this Easter Sunday. pic.twitter.com/xzgjtcTwQy — President Biden (@POTUS) March 31, 2024 This was their attempt at damage control. Jesus’ “sacrifice”? The sacrifice was made on Good Friday. On the third day, Easter Sunday, Jesus rose again. On Easter Sunday we celebrate Jesus’ Resurrection and eternal life. They couldn’t even get the walk back right. Because they don’t know and don’t care. What they do know, and what they do care about, is the power to subdue Christians and replace our values with theirs. After this weekend, there is no getting around the fact that if our society and culture are to survive in Christianity, this pagan, satanic cabal must be turned out of power as completely as possible in the fall."
"2","Bird flu is, famously, a disease that infects birds. But on Monday, federal and state authorities reported that a person in Texas had tested positive for the disease, the second person in the US to contract avian influenza in the last two years. Stranger still, the patient didn’t contract the disease from a sick chicken or wild bird but from a cow, which was presumably infected with the virus. Rarely, if ever, have mammals infected humans with bird flu. The Texas patient reported only one mild symptom — namely, pink eye — and is recovering, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet the news is the latest in a long string of recent headlines that raise concerns about the risk that bird flu poses to public health . Avian influenza has ravaged domestic flocks, causing farmers to cull chickens by the millions. It’s also decimated wild birds and many marine mammals including seals and sea lions. And the virus is spreading, reaching penguins in Antarctica and at least one polar bear in the Arctic . These developments are concerning. But how worried should we be? Here’s what to know about the risk to humans and to the millions of farmed and wild animals. Bird flu basics: What it is, and where it comes from Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a general term for the disease caused by influenza viruses that primarily infect and spread among poultry and some wild birds. They’re distinct from viruses that cause the flu in humans, though they’re related . These avian viruses are quite common. They’ve been circulating for eons among wild waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, without causing them much harm. Mild forms of infection are called “low-pathogenic avian influenza,” or LPAI, which means they’re typically not deadly to wildlife. The type of avian influenza spreading today is different. Occasionally, an LPAI virus can jump from wild birds to birds on poultry farms. As the virus replicates in densely packed warehouses of farmed birds, it can quickly evolve and adapt in ways that make it highly deadly to poultry. At that point, it gets dubbed a “highly pathogenic avian influenza virus,” or HPAI virus. That’s what’s circulating today — an HPAI virus. Our world, explained What questions do you want us to answer? Tell us by filling out this form . Highly pathogenic bird flu has caused outbreaks on poultry farms many times in the past that have killed thousands to millions of farm birds. What makes this particular form of avian influenza virus so unusual is that it easily spreads and causes severe disease among wild birds and an increasing number of mammals. That’s rare. The current strain of avian influenza spreading today descended from a virus that caused an outbreak on a goose farm in Guangdong, China, in 1996. The US first experienced one of these goose farm virus outbreaks in 2014 and 2015, which caused the death and culling of tens of millions of poultry birds and an unknown number of wild birds. Then in 2021, a related version of the virus arrived in the US — the cause of the current outbreak — that appears much better equipped at infecting wild animals. Bird flu became big news in the months that followed when it started spreading through poultry farms. Farmers were forced to cull tens of millions of turkeys and egg-laying hens, often using a gruesome approach . It cost the federal government and the poultry industry hundreds of millions of dollars to manage and sent egg prices soaring in late 2022 and early this year. Another person got sick. Does that up my risk? Poultry farms were hit hardest in 2022, with a flare-up in late 2023. Yet over the last two years, the virus has continued to spread — to different places and to different kinds of animals. Including mammals. Early in 2023, the virus killed thousands of sea lions . In March 2024, officials confirmed that goats in Minnesota and dairy cows in Texas, Kansas, and Michigan also tested positive for bird flu. The USDA has also reported “presumptive positive test results” from dairy cow herds in New Mexico and Idaho. The agency says milk, which must be pasteurized before entering the commercial food supply, remains safe to consume. “Although we don’t yet completely understand the factors that led to infection of the dairy cows with HPAI, it is possible that unique viral properties combined with epidemiological and environmental conditions all played a role for the spillover of HPAI into cattle,” said Diego Diel , an associate professor at Cornell University’s college of veterinary medicine. But what makes this concerning is the obvious fact that humans are mammals, too. As the virus makes the jump from birds to mammals, what’s stopping it from jumping to humans? In the last few years, a couple dozen people worldwide — mostly in parts of Asia — have tested positive for this particular kind of bird flu, all of which likely came into close contact with infected animals. Symptoms may be nonexistent or subtle, such as eye redness or a mild flu, or they may show up as a fever (above 100 degrees Fahrenheit) and pneumonia and can prove fatal. In the last two decades, more than 800 people have been infected with bird flu globally, and more than half of them died. In the US, however, human infections — let alone deaths — are rare. The first human case of avian influenza from the current outbreak was in 2022, when a Colorado farmer who was involved in killing chickens tested positive. The man said he was tired for a few days but quickly recovered. The person in Texas, meanwhile, tested positive in early April, after he was exposed to dairy cattle that were “presumed to be infected” with highly pathogenic bird flu, per the CDC . The patient is taking an antiviral medication and recovering, the agency said. (Avian influenza poses a much higher risk to farmers, farm workers, and people who frequently work with wildlife than it does to the general population.) As for the rest of us? First, the good news: The bird flu that infected the person in Texas (who is a dairy worker, per Politico ) is almost certainly incapable of spreading dangerous infections to other people around the planet, experts say. Simply put, the virus does not have the proper biological machinery to easily invade — let alone circulate among — humans. We have very different physiologies than birds and other animals that HPAI easily infects. (If you want to go deeper, check out our earlier explainer on this.) TL;DR: The chances of you getting bird flu anytime soon are extremely slim. The bad news is that influenza viruses evolve quickly, and unpredictably. Not only do they mutate, but they can also swap entire portions of their genomes with other viruses, creating new Franken-viruses , if two or more of them infect the same host. Under the right circumstances, this evolution could give the virus the tools to replicate more easily in mammals, which could make future strains of bird flu more threatening to humans. Scientists are now racing to figure out what, exactly, those conditions might be. More specifically, they’re looking for signs that the virus is picking up adaptations that make it more likely to replicate within mammalian cells and — critically — to spread from mammal to mammal, such as cow to cow or seal to seal. “There are many unanswered questions about the current HPAI outbreak in cattle, but one of the key questions is whether the virus is being transmitted from cow to cow,” Diel said. One new study suggests that the virus has adapted to marine mammals and may be able to spread among them. USDA officials, meanwhile, have said that transmission of avian influenza among cattle “cannot be ruled out,” in a recent update about the dairy cow outbreaks. “This virus is still relatively low risk for humans,” Marcela Uhart, a wildlife veterinarian with the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and senior author of the new study, said in a February statement. But she also had words of caution: “As long as the virus continues to replicate in mammals, it may make it a higher concern for humans. That’s why it’s so important to conduct surveillance and provide early warning.” How should we be thinking about bird flu? Obviously it’s not great that another human tested positive for bird flu. Again, he will likely be fine. But this story is not yet over. Scientists are still trying to figure out how the virus is changing and what it means that cows are getting sick. The virus could evolve to become a risk, underscoring the importance of monitoring the outbreak closely. There’s another tough reality here: Industrial animal agriculture, with thousands of animals packed together in warehouses, is a breeding ground for bird flu. So even if this current outbreak among birds wanes, we’ll likely continue to see new outbreaks in the decades to come, across different species. Eventually, that could pose a more serious risk to humans; the more chances bird flu gets to evolve, the more opportunities it has to turn into something dangerous. That raises complex questions about our food system, and how we can make it healthier for humans — not to mention farmed animals and wildlife. To prevent or slow the spread of zoonotic diseases, like bird flu and Covid-19, governments, food companies, and farmers will need to invest heavily in surveillance (including of wild birds) and even vaccines , and they may ultimately need to make much more serious changes to animal agriculture.

"2","Oppenheimer’s premiere in Japan this past weekend has renewed scrutiny of how the film depicted the devastating bombings that killed more than 200,000 people during World War II . The Oscar-winning film centers heavily on J. Robert Oppenheimer and follows the physicist’s journey in developing the atomic bomb for the United States. It does not directly show the fallout of the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and it also does not feature any Japanese perspectives in the form of major characters or testimonials. While some Japanese viewers noted that the film is from Oppenheimer’s point of view and that the lack of these voices is in line with that, others argued that its focus on his perspective helped glorify his actions and downplay their consequences. “From Hiroshima’s standpoint, the horror of nuclear weapons was not sufficiently depicted,” former Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka said during a premiere event for the film . These reactions echoed similar pushback the film received in the US — reinvigorating questions about whose stories get told, and whether the ones that Hollywood chooses to focus on offer a limited understanding of the world and gloss over major harms. Japanese viewers questioned Oppenheimer’s framing Last year, Oppenheimer’s release coincided with that of the summer’s other big blockbuster — Barbie — timing that prompted a wave of memes and articles about a “Barbenheimer’’ double feature. “Barbenheimer,” however, inspired posts — like that of a mushroom cloud replacing Barbie’s hair — which were heavily criticized in Japan for failing to recognize the impact of the atomic bombs. Warner Brothers, the company distributing the film, eventually apologized for official tweets that had responded to these memes. In the wake of this controversy — as well as concerns about the sensitivity of the film — the Japanese release of Oppenheimer was delayed. Such timing isn’t uncommon for foreign films , though the movie screened earlier for audiences in other Asian countries in the region including China and Korea. On Friday, the film premiered with content warnings for viewers , which noted that it could spur recollections about the damage and trauma the bombs caused in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Those bombs killed an estimated 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 74,000 in Nagasaki, maimed and wounded tens of thousands of others, and caused higher rates of cancer survivors. According to several news reports , the Barbenheimer controversy and the nature of the film’s subject matter have added attention to its release in Japan. Hiraoka, the former mayor of Hiroshima, is among those who have commented on the film, along with multiple surviving victims of the atomic bombs, known as “hibakusha.” “Is this really a movie that people in Hiroshima can bear to watch?” Kyoko Heya, the head of Hiroshima’s international film festival, previously asked . According to Variety , the film placed third at the box office in its opening weekend. Some Japanese people who saw the film questioned both the lack of Japanese perspectives as well as the tone of the movie, which they saw as lauding both Oppenheimer and his work on the Manhattan Project. “The sense of excitement among people celebrating the experiment and the dropping of the atomic bomb. I felt incredibly disgusted,” Erika Abiko, an anti-nuclear activist, told the BBC . “Of course this is an amazing film which deserves to win the Academy Awards,” Kawai, another viewer in Hiroshima, told Reuters . “But the film also depicts the atomic bomb in a way that seems to praise it, and, as a person with roots in Hiroshima, I found it difficult to watch.” @bbcnews In August 1945, Oppenheimer's nuclear bomb killed an estimated 140,000 people in Hiroshima and at least 74,000 people in Nagasaki. Today, the biopic about Oppenheimer's life was released in Japan. #Hiroshima #Nagasaki #Oppenheimer #Japan #NuclearBomb #History #HistoryTok #Cinema #CinemaTok #Films #Movies #BBCNews ♬ original sound - BBC News - BBC News Director Christopher Nolan has responded to such critiques in the past, noting that the film is intended to capture Oppenheimer’s perspective, so it doesn’t go beyond that. “To depart from [his experience] would betray the terms of the storytelling,” Nolan has said. “He learned about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the radio — the same as the rest of the world.” Certain Japanese moviegoers agreed with this sentiment, stating that the film’s emphasis on Oppenheimer and exclusion of other experiences made sense. Others noted that it still served as an important cautionary tale despite failing to fully capture what took place in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “This was really a film about Oppenheimer the man, and the way he wrestled with his conscience, so in that sense, I think it was right not to broaden it out too much to show the aftermath,” Mei Kawashima, a Hiroshima resident, told the Guardian. Broadly, though, many Japanese viewers expressed discomfort with Oppenheimer’s storytelling and felt the portrayal was incomplete. “The film was only about the side that dropped the A-bomb,” Tsuyuko Iwanai, a Nagasaki resident, told NPR . “I wish they had included the side it was dropped on.” These reactions build on a conversation about missing voices At its core, the Oppenheimer discourse is about which characters get humanized in major films — and who gets to narrate these stories. “I was uncomfy watching yet another movie about tortured white male genius when the victims of the atrocities glossed over by the script — Japanese people, interned Japanese Americans, and Native Americans — had no voice,” Li Lai, a Taiwanese American media critic, wrote last July . The exclusion of Japanese people in the film has been a major point of contention, as has the erasure of stories of Native Americans and Hispanic Americans who lived near New Mexico sites where significant bomb testing took place. Both Native and Hispanic communities in the region were displaced by the construction of Los Alamos, and residents who lived close to test sites have experienced disproportionately high rates of cancer and infant deaths in the decades since . By leaving these voices out of the movie, critics say Oppenheimer fails to fully grapple with the impact of the titular character’s actions — and the violence that followed. The film’s premiere in Japan has forced a confrontation of some of these concerns. There’s been debate , too, about whether Oppenheimer could have shown more of the trauma from the bombings, or if that approach would have been harmful and effectively gawking at the suffering . Naoko Wake , a Michigan State University historian who has interviewed survivors of the bombings, notes that thoughtfully including such images could be vital for awareness when there has been so little understanding of Japanese civilians’ perspective. “I ask my students every time I teach this subject, ‘Have you ever been exposed to any of the images outside of the mushroom clouds?’ They say that they have never seen images from ground zero or any effects of radiation exposure,” Wake told Vox. She points to a scene of Oppenheimer turning away from photos he’s being shown from the bombings as a potential moment in which the film could have allowed viewers to bear witness as well. Beyond videos or photos of the violence, no Japanese characters were included to express or convey the effects of these weapons, either. It’s possible to envision a scene of a radio broadcast featuring interviews with Japanese people describing their experience with the horrors of the bombs, for example. Notably, this pushback matters because it raises questions about whose perspective gets to be the definitive one in storytelling — including on such high-profile platforms. “Hollywood is a powerful tool for white perspectives,” Ponipate Rokolekutu, a professor of race and resistance studies at San Francisco State University, told KQED . “They don’t want other histories to be known.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","No one tells you, when you donate your kidney, that from that point on you’re a Kidney Guy. When kidney things happen in the news, everyone you know will text you. When a friend of a friend is diagnosed with kidney failure, as about 136,000 Americans were in 2021, you’ll hear about it. When acquaintances are thinking about donating, you’ll get a call. It’s been nearly eight years since I donated mine in 2016, and my Kidney Guy status has not faded. The flurry of kidney texts started anew at the end of March when researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston announced that they had transplanted a kidney from a genetically engineered pig into a living human for the first time. They weren’t the first to try something like this. In 2021, researchers at NYU conducted the first pig kidney (or “pigney”) donation to a brain-dead patient , finding that the transplant took and the kidney was producing urine, the way kidneys should. They also used a genetically engineered pig to reduce the odds that the human immune system would reject the organ. In 2023, the NYU team repeated the experiment and found that a pigney could last for over two months . But the Mass General researchers went a step further when they transplanted a pigney into Rick Slayman, a 62-year-old Weymouth, Massachusetts, man who was very much alive. He luckily remains alive as of this writing and is producing urine through the piece of pork that some doctors put in him. This is unquestionably good news for Slayman, and while routine pig kidney transplants are still a few years off, it’s obviously good for people with kidney failure to have more options. We shouldn’t let the news distract us, however, from an uncomfortable fact: Humans could, if we wanted to, end the kidney shortage right now without any assistance from our porcine friends. Why pigneys are a game changer The Mass General announcement is big news for one simple reason: Not enough humans are donating their kidneys. While some 135,972 Americans were diagnosed in 2021 with end-stage renal disease, a condition that you need either dialysis or a transplant to survive, only 25,549 transplants took place that year. The remaining 110,000 people needed to rely on dialysis. vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Over 60 percent of patients who started traditional dialysis in 2017 were dead by 2022 . Of patients diagnosed with kidney failure in 2017 who subsequently got a transplant from a living donor, only 13 percent were dead five years later. Life on dialysis is also dreadful to experience. It usually requires thrice- weekly four-hour sessions sitting by a machine, having your blood processed. You can’t travel for any real length of time, since you have to be close to the machine. More critically, even part-time work is difficult because dialysis is physically extremely draining . Pigneys are exciting because they represent the possibility of a world where dialysis is a relic, like iron lungs for polio. There’s still a ways to go before this future is realized. Technically, pigneys aren’t even in the clinical trial stage — to date, experiments have been allowed under “compassionate use” rules, and those participating have either been already dead or without any other option for survival. Researchers will need years to conduct formal trials and evaluate the approach for safety and complications. But these early indications are promising, and logistically, it would be feasible. We can easily have farms breed 68,000 pigs a year, each giving its kidneys to two deserving human recipients as soon as they’re diagnosed with kidney failure. The US has 75 million pigs alive now for meat production; a few dozen thousand more for transplantation is a drop in the bucket. Dialysis is a miraculous technology, but compared to transplants, it’s awful. Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images We shouldn’t need pigneys But there’s something sad to me about the pigney moment, too. Partly this is because I’m an animal lover who thinks there’s something wrong with killing pigs, which are intelligent animals capable of tasks like playing video games , for meat. And while I argue there’s obviously less wrong with killing them to harvest lifesaving organs, it seems like a necessary evil at best. Maybe we’ll take one kidney each from the pigs and then send them off to live on a beautiful farm, but I have my doubts. The bigger issue is that we should not have to rely on pigs at all. There are more than enough human beings walking around with spare kidneys who could donate them to strangers in need. They simply choose not to. Getting 136,000 human kidneys for transplant every year in the US is very possible. We can make up part of the gap by collecting more organs from deceased patients. Organ procurement organizations, which distribute organs from dead people, have been very conservative about which organs they’ll use ; federal agencies are now investigating them for fraud . There are likely thousands more organs we could be recovering every year by reforming these groups — but not enough to wipe out the kidney backlog. We can’t rely on dead people, or pigs, to close the kidney gap in the near term. We need living people. We could do more to encourage donations. Going through a nephrectomy is real work, and it deserves compensation. Many kidney donors have rallied behind a proposal to give a $10,000-a-year tax credit for every donor for five years, to make up for lost wages and other costs incurred due to donating. This would go a long way toward filling the shortage But that kind of policy change will take time as well. In the meantime, we could eliminate the backlog, this year, if a tiny share of adult Americans agreed to donate their kidney to someone who needs one. Not everyone is eligible, but far more than most people think are. Maybe a friend of yours could. Maybe a family member. Maybe you.

"2","No one is happy about the delivery apps . Not the customers, who feel gouged by an avalanche of fees. Not restaurants, who feel gut-punched by the commission apps take from them. Certainly not delivery workers, who have long been rewarded with a pittance for doing a job that, in a city like New York, has a higher injury rate than that of construction workers. Amid this dogpile of disgruntlement, the merry-go-round of debating the value of food delivery keeps spinning . After all, some people, especially those with disabilities, rely on such services — but then, it is difficult work, and everyone ought to tip well. Another faction argues that this isn’t fair, because it’s already so unaffordable. The delivery apps themselves recede somewhat into the background, as if their existence is a given. They’re merely fulfilling a demand in the market, naturally taking a cut for themselves — two plus two equals four. Our desire to consume is seen as the problem, the having-cake- and-eating-it-too mentality of expecting affordable convenience. But we should give credit where it’s due. Delivery apps have expended a lot of effort (and money) making the case that we — restaurants, workers, and consumers — desperately need them. Unhappy about the state of things now? You’ll really be pulling your hair out if you try to force the apps to change. In New York City and Seattle , new minimum pay laws for delivery workers recently went into effect. Immediately, additional “regulatory” fees were charged to customers, and restaurants and delivery workers complained that orders dropped, with Uber claiming in a blog post that they had dipped by 30 percent. Neither city’s minimum wage laws have forced delivery apps to tack on new fees, but both DoorDash and Uber Eats have introduced them nonetheless. The message is clear: If you try to mediate how the apps operate, things will just get worse. An Uber spokesperson told Vox that there were “consequences to bad regulations and we made these consequences clear in repeated testimony that both cities chose to disregard.” A DoorDash spokesperson wrote that its platform “has to work for everyone who uses it — Dashers, merchants, and customers alike — which is why we’ve opposed these extreme new rules.” They continued that the new laws “require platforms like DoorDash to pay well above the local minimum wages, not including additional pay for mileage and tips. Just as we warned, the increased costs created by these regulations have led to an alarming drop in work for Dashers and lost revenue for small businesses.” Grubhub did not reply to a request for comment. Some headlines have already declared app- delivery regulations a failure; the Seattle City Council is considering gutting the law while the ink is still drying. At the crisis point of consumers fed up with the cost of food delivery, companies like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub — the three biggest in the US — are insisting on their irreplaceable value to the restaurants, consumers, and workers who have long complained about them. “These guys are doing what I call a corporate tantrum” Kimberly Wolfe, a delivery app driver in Seattle who fought for the wage law with an advocacy group called Working Washington, isn’t buying it. “These guys are doing what I call a corporate tantrum,” she tells Vox. “They’re just cutting off their nose to spite their face.” What apps take from restaurants and customers To be sure, delivery apps are convenient. For this ease of use, customers are painfully up-charged. Menu prices are almost always more expensive than ordering directly from restaurants. Then there are the line- item fees that appear on the receipt. There’s the delivery fee, but also the frustratingly generic “service fee” that could cover anything from keeping the apps’ servers up to paying their drivers. DoorDash charges a 15 percent service fee that starts at a $3 minimum. Uber Eats charges an unspecified service fee that depends on basket size. Browsing Grubhub in Seattle, I loaded a sample $62 food order and was levied a $14 service fee. Then add the taxes and tip. For the privilege of having a meal delivered to your home — something pizza and Chinese restaurants have done for at least half a century — you might find yourself paying nearly double the cost of just the food. For restaurants, there’s a price as well. For the privilege of being found in the apps’ centralized hubs, apps can swipe as much as 30 percent of an order’s subtotal from restaurants, even collecting a commission on pickup orders. That’s if diners choose them over the influx of ghost kitchens and promoted partners. Much attention has been paid to the fact that delivery apps aren’t profitable, or were on a long road to becoming profitable — but that’s in large part because they chose to invest aggressively in growth over being in the black at the end of the year. Last year, DoorDash’s profit margin was nearly 49 percent. Even after deducting a bunch of its biggest expenses, including driver pay, Uber’s delivery segment pocketed $1.5 billion , an increase of 173 percent from 2022. Out of $8.6 billion in revenue in 2023, DoorDash spent almost $2 billion on sales and marketing, and another billion on R&D.; It also spent $750 million last year buying back its own stock, a move often used by corporations to boost stock value. Uber has also long poured money into sales and marketing , which includes things like promotions and discounts, as well as R&D;, in order to grow. This year, the company is preparing to shell out a cool $7 billion on stock buybacks . What (little) apps provide to delivery workers While customers find themselves paying $9-plus service fees on a delivery order, the worker handing you the food might only get a few dollars, all while paying for their own vehicle and fuel. Wolfe recalls how paltry some of the payouts were before the Seattle wage law, when she would see $2 to $3 for an order before tips. In May 2022, Working Washington aggregated data from over 400 delivery jobs in the Seattle area and found that restaurant delivery workers were making on average $8.71 per hour after deducting basic expenses such as gas, which was far below the city’s 2022 minimum hourly wage of $17.27. During a Working Washington protest at City Hall in 2022, paper bags with receipts showing how much a worker had made on a delivery order were put on display. “There were quite a few that were negative,” says Wolfe. “Once you figured expenses and all that, you were basically paying them to deliver.” A 2022 study from NYC’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) found that, after expenses, food delivery workers in the city were making an average of $11.12 per hour — again, sub-minimum wages. Crucially, customer tips made up about half of a delivery driver’s total earnings before expenses. (Data from Solo, which makes software for app-based gig workers, shows that tips make up a similar proportion of pay in Seattle.) A more recent report on the adopted minimum pay projected that drivers’ annual earnings after expenses (and accounting for the common practice of working for multiple apps) would rise from $11,970 in 2021 to $32,500 by 2025. Yet this calculation relies on a key assumption: that customers would keep tipping about the same amount as before the wage law. It’s hard to imagine that tipping rates in Seattle and NYC would stay the same given that the apps have added friction to the process. On both DoorDash and Uber Eats in these two cities, the tipping prompt now comes up after delivery, not at checkout, when diners are less likely to engage with the app. On GrubHub, the option to tip at checkout is still available, but many NYC-area restaurants on the platform now show lower default tipping options that max out at 12 percent. (Of course, a customer can still input a custom amount.) “After the minimum wage started, I would be on the apps and after two hours it would lock me out” It has also likely gone down because deliveries have gone down. Some workers in NYC report that the apps are now locking them out , restricting the number of hours they work. Justice for App Workers, a coalition of rideshare and delivery workers, held a rally in front of New York’s city hall on March 27 to demand that the city address the lockouts. Food delivery workers are saying that they’re “unable to work for hours and days on end,” according to a statement released by the group. Bimal Ghale, a delivery worker in New York who is part of the Justice for App Workers group, told Vox through an interpreter that he used to work five to six hours at a time. “After the minimum wage started, I would be on the apps and after two hours it would lock me out,” he says. “The apps claim the area isn’t busy.” But Ghale is still delivering in the same neighborhoods he did before the new pay law, and the DCWP has also stated that orders have “ remained steady .” An Uber spokesperson said that the city had known workers’ access to apps would become limited due to the new hourly pay rule. “Since the rule went into effect, nearly 6,000 couriers have lost access to the platform, nearly 20,000 people are on the waitlist to work on the app,” the spokesperson said. Since last December, when the pay rule went into effect in NYC, at least 500 complaints have been lodged with the DCWP alleging that apps aren’t following it. A DCWP spokesperson told Vox that the department was monitoring compliance. In Seattle, DoorDash has slapped a $4.99 regulatory fee on all orders, and in NYC it charges an extra $1.99. It’s unclear how these meaningfully differ from the catchall service fee, a portion of which can also cover worker pay — except that the labeling points the finger at the law for higher prices. DoorDash’s regulatory response fees are meant to cover the costs of new regulations. The DCWP estimates that if apps passed on only half of their labor costs to consumers, instead of all of it, they would still pocket $232 million a year in revenue. It’s not a given that the apps have to charge us more to pay their workers better. Apps cry that their hands are tied Not long after the pay law went into effect, DoorDash published a blog claiming that Seattle businesses had already lost over $1 million in revenue and that workers were making less because orders on the platform had dropped. Grubhub’s write-up on the law’s adverse effects claims that tips are down 26 percent , with no mention of the fact that many of its Seattle-area merchants now show a lower range of tipping options — a tactic the company has used before . None of these tactics are new. Just look at what happened in California after the passage of a ballot initiative called Proposition 22 a few years ago, which allowed app-based gig work companies like Uber and DoorDash to classify their workers as independent contractors, saving them a lot of money. In exchange, they agreed to pay 120 percent of the minimum wage for every hour of trip time — as in, time spent logged on the app, waiting for a ride or for an order to appear, would not count. App companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars backing Prop 22, even threatening to pull out of California if it failed to pass. They also warned that, without Prop 22, prices would go up for customers. A month after the successful vote, delivery apps announced fee increases anyway. The math doesn’t add up. On the one hand, delivery apps play up the fact that they’re just intermediaries helping facilitate the sale or delivery of a product — they’re not employers, who would be on the hook for far greater payroll taxes and other employment costs than what apps currently pay. On the other hand, they command a steep price from restaurants and customers for matchmaking, of which the workers only see a narrow slice. The apps don’t make the food taste better, or deliver faster, and it’s obviously not cheaper. So who, exactly, benefits from their existence? What do they really add to the tangle of relationships we call the economy ? If app companies leave cities like Seattle and New York to avoid having to pay higher labor costs, who would lose? Wolfe doesn’t seem worried. Her thinking is that if they can’t run a competent business, perhaps they shouldn’t be in business. “Don’t let the door hit you,” she says. “Because you want capitalism — baby, that’s capitalism.” Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","On April 8, 2024, millions of Americans will be able to see a rare celestial occurrence: a total solar eclipse. It’s going to be awesome . If you’re in the center of the moon’s shadow, known as the totality, the sky will go dark for a few minutes in the middle of the day. The temperature will drop , stars will appear, and birds will become confused and start chirping their nighttime songs. And it’s all because of a cosmic coincidence: From the Earth, the moon and the sun appear to be roughly the same size . By many measures, April’s event will (please excuse the pun) eclipse the last total solar eclipse that passed over the United States in 2017. There are few reasons. The shadow of totality will be twice as wide as that of the 2017 eclipse (more on why below), so it will be easier to find a place to view it in any given state. The time of totality — how long the moon is completely covering the sun — will also be almost twice as long, at over four minutes in many locations. The eclipse is occurring near the peak of the sun’s 11 -year magnetic cycle, which could increase the chances of seeing great loops of the sun’s plasma sprouting from the side of the eclipse. “And I think even more importantly, 2024 passes over a much bigger population,” says Ernie Wright, who works in NASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio . He did the eclipse calculations underlying many of the maps and illustrations you’ll see in this article. “More than twice as many people actually live in the path and don’t have to go anywhere to see it.” If you live anywhere in the path from Kerrville, Texas, to Houlton, Maine, you’re in luck. If you want to travel to see it, book accommodations now! Hotels in many areas are filling up . But even if you can’t get to the path of totality, you’ll be able to view at least a partial solar eclipse (which is pretty cool) from any location in the lower 48 United States. It will be the last total solar eclipse in the lower 48 United States until 2045. So, if you’ve been eager to see one in the US, now is your last chance for 21 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the upcoming eclipse. Why do we have solar eclipses? There’s a simple answer: The moon occasionally covers the sun in its path across the sky. But it’s more complicated than that. Three cosmic conditions have to be met to produce the shadow. First, there has to be a new moon. One side of the moon is always lit by the sun, but the lit side isn’t always facing the Earth. This is how we get the phases of the moon. For a solar eclipse to occur, it needs to be in its “new moon” phase. During the new moon, the dark side of the moon is directly facing the Earth. Ernie Wright /NASA Then, the moon has to cross the plane of Earth’s orbit. If the dark side of the moon has to be facing the Earth for a solar eclipse to occur, why don’t we have them every new moon? The moon’s orbit isn’t perfectly matched up with the Earth’s. That’s because the moon is tilted on a 5-degree axis. No one is completely sure why the moon is slightly skewed, but it might have to do with how it was likely formed: from a massive object smashing into Earth. A depiction of the a new moon’s shadow missing the Earth. NASA This means during most new moons, the shadow misses the Earth. But there are two points in the moon’s orbit where the shadow can fall on the Earth. These are called nodes. Joss Fong/Vox For a total eclipse to occur, the moon needs to be at or very close to one of the nodes. Joss Fong/Vox Finally, whether the entire sun is covered depends on the moon’s distance to the Earth. You might remember this from middle school science: The moon’s orbit around the Earth is not a perfect circle. It’s an ellipse. Wikipedia There’s a point in the orbit where the moon is the farthest it gets from the sun and a point where it’s the closest. For a total eclipse to occur, the moon needs to be near its closest approach to Earth. If the eclipse occurs when the moon is close, it will totally block out the sun. If it’s farther away, we get what’s called a “ ring of fire ” eclipse. How do we know when eclipses will happen? The three conditions that conspire to create eclipses — the new moon, the moon crossing the plane of Earth’s orbit, and the moon’s distance to the Earth — all recur on slightly different time scales. It takes the moon 27.212 days to return to a node (this is called a draconic month). Every 27.554 days, the moon returns to its closest approach to Earth (an anomalistic month). The moon finishes cycling through all its phases once every 29.530 days (a synodic month). The system that keeps track of all three months and when they overlap is called the Saros cycle , and it predicts both solar and lunar eclipses. Saros is ancient: The Babylonians discovered it in the few centuries before the start of the common era. And they worked it all out just by making careful observations of the moon for hundreds of years. Today, NASA doesn’t have to rely on the Saros cycle alone to predict eclipses. “It starts with knowing where the Earth, the moon, and the sun are,” Wright says of making eclipse prediction and maps. “But then you need to calculate, based on the geometry, what the shape of that shadow is and where it’s going to hit the Earth.” The GIF below, produced by Wright and colleagues, demonstrates how the moon casts it shadow. NASA Scientific Visualization Studio To make extremely accurate maps and projections of the eclipse, Wright says, he even takes into account how the moon isn’t a perfect sphere. The edge of the moon “has mountains and valleys on it, and that actually affects the shape of the shadow,” he says. “And so with some extra calculation, you can take that into account. It’s the reason, when you look at my map, the shadow shape on the ground is not a perfect oval. It’s kind of a potato shape.” You can see that potato shadow shape in Wright’s animation of the shadow passing over Arkansas, Indiana, and Ohio. ( See the entire video of the shadow’s path here. ) Ernie Wright/NASA Scientific Visualization Studio Can eclipses happen anywhere on Earth? Eventually, every spot on Earth will see an eclipse. Wright made a map overlaying all the paths of every total solar eclipse that has occurred since the year 2000 BCE and will occur up to the year 3000 CE. The brighter the color, the more eclipses have occurred in that spot. Every spot on his map is colored in by at least one eclipse, Wright says — the map below comprises 14.6 million pixels , and they all are colored in. NASA Scientific Visualization Studio/Ernie Wright Do some places see more eclipses than others? Interestingly, with the map above, Wright finds more eclipses have occurred and will occur in the Northern Hemisphere than in the South. There’s a reason for this. During the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the Earth is slightly farther away from the sun than when it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. “During Northern Hemisphere summer, we’re a little bit farther away from the sun, so the sun looks slightly smaller in the sky,” he explains. “That makes it a little easier for the moon to cover the sun.” And eclipses are more likely in the summer “just because the Sun is up longer then,” he explains in his post on the NASA website. Which places are going to get totality? When? And for how long? In the United States, the total solar eclipse in April will cut a path from Texas all the way up to Maine. What time the eclipse starts and how long it lasts are dependent on the spot you choose to observe it. For example, in Kerrville, Texas, the totality will start at 1:32 pm local time and last for 4 minutes and 24 seconds. In Houlton, Maine, the totality starts at 3:32 pm local time and only lasts for 3 minutes and 20 seconds. For all the information on when the eclipse starts, check out NASA’s great interactive Eclipse Explorer . Click on any city on the map there to see local eclipse information, including start times and lengths of totality. NASA Why will this eclipse last longer than the 2017 one? In 2017, the length of totality for most places in the US hovered around the two-minute mark. This year’s eclipse will last around three or four minutes, depending on the location . Why is this one so much longer? Again, it all has to do with the moon’s slightly elliptical orbit around the Earth. The oval shape of the orbit means “every month there are times when the moon is closer and times when it’s farther away,” Wright says. “We can only get total eclipses when the moon is pretty close to us.” Otherwise the result is that annular “ring of fire” eclipse, where the sun isn’t completely blocked out. But during the 2024 eclipse, the moon will be nearer to the Earth than it was in 2017. The closer the moon is, the bigger it appears to us in the sky and the larger the shadow it casts, including during an eclipse. And a bigger shadow takes a longer time to clear an area. Outside the totality, what will the rest of the country see? The entire lower 48 United States will be able to observe at least a partial eclipse, where just a portion of the sun is covered by the moon. (You’ll need special solar eclipse glasses to view it safely — more on those below.) The Pacific Northwest will see about a quarter of the sun obscured, while the Southeast will see around 75 percent. For exactly what you’ll see in your area and when, check out NASA’s Eclipse Explorer . NASA Scientific Visualization Studio Can I livestream totality? Yes! NASA is going to stream live coverage of the eclipse from several sites across the path of totality, starting at 1 pm Eastern Standard Time on April 8. Are there any places in the US that got totality in 2017 and have it again in 2024? Carbondale, Illinois, and the surrounding area in southern Illinois are getting a repeat total solar eclipse . Way to go! Wright says that, on average, an area should see a repeat eclipse once every 365 years. “To have two of them happen within seven years is, you know — it’s pretty lucky for Carbondale,” he says. Do we know where the next total solar eclipse is going to be? Absolutely. There’s a total solar eclipse roughly once every 18 months. The next total solar eclipse will be on August 12, 2026, and it will pass over Spain, Iceland, and Greenland. NASA keeps a catalog of all the eclipses (both solar and lunar ) that have occurred or will occur from 1999 BCE to the 3000 CE. That’s five millennia , mind you. That’s why we know, for instance, that on January 27, 2837, a total solar eclipse will pass over southern Mexico . (Will any humans be around to see it?) The next solar eclipse over the United States will be visible in Alaska in 2033 . And the next one in the lower 48 states will be in 2045. Great American Eclipse Okay, enough with the astronomy. What happens on the ground during a total solar eclipse? If you’re in the path of the total solar eclipse, expect to do a fair amount of waiting around for the big moment. The eclipse goes through a few phases. In Kerrville, Texas, the partial eclipse phase starts around 12:14 pm, but the totality doesn’t begin until 1:32 pm. For anywhere in the path of totality, the first thing you’re going to see is a partial eclipse: the moon slowly starting to obscure the sun. For this part of the eclipse, be sure to wear special eclipse glasses (more on them below). Sijori Images/Barcroft India/Barcroft Media via Getty Images During a partial solar eclipse, shadows form eerie crescent shapes. fdecomite /Flickr When totality nears, that’s when the show really begins. There are a couple of awesome phenomena that you can look out for. Right before totality, the last glimpse of light from the sun will form a “diamond ring” in the sky. SSPL/Getty Images You’ll also be able to see “Baily’s beads” (named after astronomer Francis Baily): bits of light poking through canyons and craters on the roughed-up surface of the moon. SSPL/Getty Image Insider tip: Wright says if you want to see more Baily’s beads, choose to watch the eclipse near the edge of the totality zone on the map. “The edge of the moon is grazing the edge of the sun at that point on the path,” Wright says. Then comes totality: when the moon is fully covering the sun. This is what you’ve been waiting for. When the totality happens, the sky goes dark. Stars come out. You can see the corona — the sun’s wispy outer atmosphere. This is normally too faint to see, even if you are wearing solar eclipse glasses. But with the moon blocking the sun’s light, it shines through in an almost ghostly manner. You might also see little prominences jutting out of the side of the shadow (seen in red in the image below). These are regions of intense magnetism where the sun’s plasma extends outward from the surface. The sun’s corona is visible as the moon obscures the sun during the Great American Solar Eclipse, in Madras, Oregon, on August 21, 2017. Carlos Avila Gonzalez/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images While you’re dazzled by the corona, consider this: The sun’s atmosphere is actually hotter than its surface, but no one really knows why . What’s so awesome about totality? Photos can’t really capture the awesomeness of totality. “Anytime you’ve ever taken a picture of the full moon, it never captures how it felt in your eyes and in your heart, you know what I mean?” Rhonda Coleman, an eclipse chaser, told me in 2017 . “It seems to fill the sky, but your photograph will only be a memory.” I saw the 2017 eclipse in South Carolina. Here’s how I described it at the time : When the shadow fully took over the sun, the crickets chirped, the kids screamed, Venus appeared bright in the sky next to the sun, and I lay down before a black, black disc that was surrounded by the most angelic white light I’ve ever seen. It must be the color Renaissance painters yearned for when painting pictures of God in heaven — sublime, gentle, powerful, and singular. So yeah, viewing the eclipse might bring out overwrought prose in you too. You’ve been warned! Will it change my life? Many people report feeling a profound sense of awe during and after a total solar eclipse. “You suddenly feel as though you can see the clockwork of the solar system,” Wright t old me back in 2017 . He continued: We kind of know — in the back of our minds — that we live in a giant ball and it revolves around a hot ball of gas, and we’re floating in space. But you don’t really believe it until you see something like a total solar eclipse, where everything is all lined up and you go whoaaa. Other planets pop out. You got instant nighttime. And you can see Mercury and Venus usually. And sometimes Mars and Jupiter. ... It looks like the pictures from the textbook. It’s not entirely a science thing anymore. ... It’s mostly a thing where you have a better appreciation of where you are in the solar system. Your experience may vary. Do normal laws apply during totality, or am I allowed to do weird, wolflike things without the fear of repercussions? Arguably, you can do weird, wolflike things any day of the year. But check your local and federal laws before proceeding. Will my pets freak out? In 2017, I posed this question to Bill Kramer, a 16-plus-time eclipse viewer who runs Eclipse Chasers , an online community for, well, you know. Kramer says pets get confused and will think it’s nighttime. “Some dogs bark at the eclipse,” he says. “Some dogs detect the emotion of the moment, or anxiety beforehand, and react accordingly. Never heard of one reacting like some do to fireworks or gunshots. The eclipse is a silent thing, except for the ambient sounds and cheers. ... Cats, on the other hand, are cats.” During the 2017 eclipse, zoos reported odd behavior with their animals . At a zoo in South Carolina, CNN recalled in a recent news story , “the giraffes gathered and broke into a gallop, the Galápagos tortoises began to mate, and the gorillas started to get ready for bed.” How animals react to eclipses is still something of a mystery overall. This April you can sign up to be part of a National Science Foundation-funded citizens science project to help collect data. More information on that on the SciStarter website . Will bad weather ruin the eclipse? Always a risk. If you’re feeling really anxious about picking out the “perfect” spot to view, you’ll want to find a place with little cloud cover. An eclipse on a cloud-covered day is still cool (it will get very, very dark), but you won’t be able to see the dark mask of the moon in front of the sun. The weather, as you know, can be hard to predict. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is here to help. The agency has created an interactive map ( click for the full map ; see a static version of it below) that projects the likelihood of cloud cover for many cities in the path of the eclipse based on historical weather data. For example, in Cleveland, Ohio, there’s a 43 percent chance of it being overcast. That’s a relatively bad bet compared to Waco, Texas, where there is a 25.8 percent chance of it being overcast. NOAA The Washington Post is keeping track of the eclipse day forecasts . Check them out for daily updates. Will I go blind? Not if you’re careful! On a normal day, staring straight into the sun can harm your eyes. On eclipse day, it is no different. NASA warns : “It is never safe to look directly at the sun’s rays — even if the sun is partly obscured.” So don’t look at the partial eclipse directly! The intense light from the sun can damage your retinas and cause “permanent scotoma or ‘blind spot’ in the central vision,” according to the Lancet . Even when the sun is 99 percent obscured, it can still cause damage. During the partial eclipse phases, and even through the eclipse’s “Baily’s beads” and “diamond ring” phases — when you can see the last bits of sun peeking through the craters of the moon — you need eye protection. You can only take the protective glasses off when the moon has completely covered the sun during totality. Regular sunglasses won’t block enough light. You’ll need glasses that filter all but 0.003 percent of visible light and block out most ultraviolet and infrared as well. “Such filters usually have a thin layer of aluminum, chromium or silver deposited on their surfaces that attenuates ultraviolet, visible, and infrared energy,” NASA’s eye safety page explains. You could grab a pair of the darkest available (No. 14) welder’s glasses. But this is even easier: Pick up a dirt- cheap pair of disposable eclipse glasses. The American Astronomical Society (AAS) points out there are several manufacturers that meet international standards for eclipse eye protection. They are: Grafix Plastics Halo Eclipse Spectacles American Paper Optics / eclipseglasses.com Seymour Solar Flip’n Shades DayStar Filters Rainbow Symphony Thousand Oaks Optical The AAS has more information on eclipse glasses retailers. Importantly, the AAS does not recommend “searching for eclipse glasses on Amazon, eBay, Temu, or any other online marketplace and buying from whichever vendor offers the lowest price.” Be sure to identify the manufacturer of the glasses and see that they are on the approved list above. The good news is you might be able to pick up a verified pair for free at a local library. The Space Science Institute has donated 5 million solar eclipse glasses to 10,000 libraries across the United States. Call your local library and ask whether they have any available. What does a total solar eclipse look like from space? In 1999, a French astronaut on the Mir space station snapped this photo of a total solar eclipse over Europe. Via NASA If you’ve made it this far, you might be thinking, “I can’t believe I just read more than 3,000 words on the total solar eclipse. Could you just show me some awesome eclipse photos now?” Sure. Solar eclipse seen from the city of La Serana, 500 kilometers north of Santiago, Chile, on July 2, 2019.

"2","There’s a total solar eclipse somewhere on Earth once every 18 months or so. And whether it’s passing over a barren, ice-cragged coast of Antarctica, a remote African desert, or a lonely patch of ocean, you can be sure there will be an umbraphile — a shadow-loving eclipse chaser — there to see it. Eclipse chasers are people who plan their lives around (and spend small fortunes on) eclipse travel. This year , of course, they’ll be joining millions of people in the United States to see the total solar eclipse on April 8. Before the last US eclipse in 2017, we wanted to know: What’s so special about total solar eclipses that you would chase them around the world? So we called up eight eclipse chasers and talked to them for hours, asking them all a similar set of questions. Their responses were much more moving and poetic than we anticipated. Chasing eclipses is not about a cheap thrill. It’s more like a pilgrimage, but one with a constantly moving shrine. “There are insufficient superlatives in the English language, or any language for that matter, to adequately describe the experience of a total solar eclipse,” one told us. Let’s try. These conversations took place in 2017, and they have been lightly edited for length and clarity. How many total solar eclipses have you seen? Rhonda Coleman Bella Lucy/Vox Rhonda Coleman, eclipse-chasing resident of Bend, Oregon Six. … I'm a very modest chaser. Some people have [seen] dozens. Glenn Schneider, astronomer at the University of Arizona Thirty-three. Bill Kramer, a retired computer engineer who runs the website Eclipse-chaser.com Sixteen total solar eclipses. Fred Espenak, a retired NASA astrophysicist who has predicted the next 1,000 years of eclipses I've been to 27 total eclipses and I've seen about 20 of them. Seven clouded out. David Makepeace Bella Lucy/Vox David Makepeace, eclipse chaser and filmmaker This one in America will be my 16th. Joe Rao, meteorologist in New York I've seen a grand total of 11 total eclipses. Kate Russo, clinical psychologist and author of Being in the Shadow : Stories of first-time eclipse experience I've seen 10 total solar eclipses, and of those, two were clouded out. Mike Kentrianakis, astronomer with the American Astronomical Society’s solar eclipse task force I have seen 10 total solar eclipses. Tell us about your first time Joe Rao They say you never forget your first kiss, you never forget making love for the first time, and as far as an eclipse chaser goes, you always remember your first time in the shadow. David Makepeace I flew to Mexico to see a girl. I didn't go to see an eclipse. And then the eclipse came, and it completely floored me. I was completely unprepared for the vision I saw in the sky, and for how intense the feeling was of all of a sudden being lifted in my consciousness off the globe, off this two-dimensional life I was living. It opened up a three- dimensionality that I was not prepared for. ... In some sense, I've spent the past 26 years also trying to come to terms with that. Bill Kramer We were bobbing in the water, clear sky all around us; the sea was relatively calm. This eclipse darkness wall came flashing across the water — and covered us in darkness. And there was this eclipse. “This is like looking upon the eye of God.” That's the nearest thing I could equate it to. Glenn Schneider I was literally transfixed, I couldn't move. I couldn't operate my cameras. I didn't even think about the telescope. My binoculars hung around my neck and I just stood there staring up at the hole in the sky. ... When it was over, I just stood there unable to move until somebody finally shook me back into reality. Fred Espenak By the time the total eclipse ended … I had already promised myself that once in a lifetime was not enough. It was just spectacular and much too short. I've been to the majority of them since then over the past 47 years. Kate Russo I had no idea that it was going to be so powerful and emotive and euphoric and exciting. ... It's very unlike any other experience. This is why us eclipse chasers are so passionate. We so want to share this experience with other people. What does it feel like to experience a total solar eclipse? Why are you hooked? Bill Kramer There are insufficient superlatives in the English language — or any language, for that matter — to adequately describe the experience of a total solar eclipse. I always tell people my fifth eclipse is when my hands stopped shaking during totality. I made a comment of that, and a guy who's seen more eclipses than I came back and said, ""Really? Your hands stopped shaking?"" Kate Russo When I talk about seeing a total solar eclipse, nobody gets it. Nobody can actually understand what it's like in that situation because it's just not within our human experience. The rules of nature are turned upside down, so we just cannot imagine it. Joe Rao How much alien stimulation can the mind process in just a little over two minutes? If I told you that I was in a major thunderstorm, or I saw a gorgeous sunset, you can relate to that. Because I'm sure you have experienced a big thunderstorm in your life, and I'm sure you've seen more than your share of beautiful sunsets. When I tell people about my first total eclipse, or any total eclipse, it's impossible to relate that. Rhonda Coleman It's very ... it almost is like a bit of a dreadful feeling. It's like, ""Whoa, wait a minute. What's happening to my planet?"" ... It's a topsy-turvy world. It's not like night. It's not like day. It's not like twilight. It's like nothing you've ever felt before. Fred Espenak You experience the music of the spheres , as Kepler called them, the mechanics of the solar system in action. You get an overwhelming sense of humbleness and how small and petty we really are compared to the mechanics of the solar system, the clockwork of the universe. These events that are taking place, that in no way can we affect or stop. It gives us a sense of how tiny we are and yet how we're connected to the whole system. All this happens all at once. David Makepeace I saw the total eclipse and I realized that I was living in a much deeper, much more dynamic universe than I had previously considered. Mike Kentriankis Bella Lucy/Vox Mike Kentrianakis This is the grandest of all astronomical spectacles. It's actually the greatest natural wonder that you could possibly see. Except, of course, the birth of a child. How do other people typically react to totality, when the sun is completely covered by the moon? Fred Espenak Daylight suddenly changes to an eerie twilight in just a handful of seconds, and that's dramatic enough. Then it tends to get quiet. The bright sun that was there just moments ago has vanished. It's replaced by this black orb of the moon. You hear some people saying: ""Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,"" and they just say it for three minutes. Others are totally speechless. Some people might even be praying. Others, just tears of joy running down their cheek. Kate Russo Even really hard-nosed scientists can get very, very moved during totality, and it's not uncommon to see people afterward with tears and hugging and feeling very choked up. What’s the farthest you’ve gone to see one? Or the most difficult journey? Joe Rao Bella Lucy/Vox Joe Rao You do crazy things to see a total eclipse of the sun. In 1990, for example, I managed to get a commercial airline to change the itinerary of their flight. I noticed that there was one particular flight from Honolulu to San Francisco where if they were to delay the flight by 41 minutes, they would be over the Pacific Ocean, and they'd be able to see a total eclipse of the sun. I contacted the airline ... they thought it was a heck of a great idea, and they did it. David Makepeace The most extreme eclipse chase that I've ever been on I saw from the coast of the far side of Antarctica. This huge, gorgeous Russian icebreaker ship that took more than 100 eclipse chasers from the tip of Africa down through the Indian Ocean to the Antarctic coast. Then we positioned ourselves precisely in the path of totality and were able to witness humanity's first glimpse of a total eclipse of the sun from the ice continent. Glenn Schneider The first eclipse I saw by air, which was in 1986, was one of the most difficult eclipses to get to. Only nine people on earth actually saw that eclipse as a central total eclipse. The width of the path was less than a kilometer. We had to fly about 1,000 kilometers out of Reykjavik, Iceland, between Iceland and Greenland to see that. That was before the days of GPS navigation. It was a rather, rather dicey thing to do. Is a partial solar eclipse just as good? Fred Espenak The difference between a 99 percent eclipse and a 100 percent total eclipse is enormous. I like to use the analogy [that] it's like getting five out of six numbers right on the jackpot. If you got five out of six, you were close, but you lost. ... Only 100 percent counts. Kate Russo When you come across someone who says that they thought it was overrated, if you ask a bit about where they were, it turns out that they didn't see a total eclipse. They saw a partial eclipse, but they're convinced it was a total. Is it an “addiction”? Joe Rao I tell people, total eclipses of the sun are like potato chips. When you see it for the first time, the first thing that comes out of your mouth after the eclipse is over is, ""When's the next one?"" And you become hooked. Glenn Schneider Bella Lucy/Vox Glenn Schneider It almost becomes like there is not a choice. You plan your future travels and life years and years ahead. It's not like there's any question where you're going to be taking your vacation 12 years from now. You've already got it figured out. David Makepeace The corona looks different every single time. You don't know how many Baily's beads or what kind of prominences you'll see shooting off the surface of the sun. It is an experience of the most grand and exalted nature, so why would you not want to immerse yourself in that as much as possible? Does eclipse chasing come with a cost, personal or otherwise? Rhonda Coleman Financial, I'll give you that. David Makepeace God, I probably spent over $100,000 doing the travel in the past two and a half decades. You could say that I've been so caught up in the learning and in the growth personally that's come from this that I've put off marriage and a family. I've sort of resisted the accumulation of material possessions so that I have the funds to be able to afford this kind of travel. Are eclipses a form of psychological balm? Kate Russo Bella Lucy/Vox Kate Russo It's like something that is a reminder of how wonderful life is. It gives you life insights that you normally get only at times when you've experienced loss. How many more eclipses do you hope to see? Rhonda Coleman I figure if I live to be 87 and beyond, which I'm doing pretty well so far, my last one will be, again in the United States, when I'm 87. I think it's going to be in North Dakota or something like that. I think I can get there. I'm 58. Glenn Schneider I've already told my daughter where she needs to go to watch the 2079 eclipse on May 1, 2079. I don't expect to make it, but I hope she can. Fred Espenak I certainly hope to see another dozen or more eclipses. Mike Kentrianakis Our life is now measured by a greater cycle. It's no longer a second and a minute hand, and an hour, a day. But if you start using eclipse cycles, how many do you have? Not that many. Should first-timers try to take pictures? Rhonda Coleman Anytime you've ever taken a picture of the full moon, it never captures how it felt in your eyes and in your heart, you know what I mean? It seems to fill the sky, but your photograph will only be a memory. Mike Kentrianakis The photograph just doesn't do it justice. It's almost like looking at a shadow of a building and not looking at the building. It's a representation of what you would know it to be ... a sketch of a missing person. Joe Rao Don't try to photograph it. Please don't. Trying to photograph your first total eclipse of the sun is like ... your first girlfriend or boyfriend. You're not very good, it's over very quickly, and you just want to do it again. Fred Espenak I recommend not trying to photograph it unless you are really a hardcore, absolutely-have-to-photograph-everything-in-your-life kind of person. ... You don't want to be dealing with technology during the eclipse. David Makepeace Totality ... I absolutely guarantee it will seem like eight seconds. Bill Kramer Whatever you do, don't use a flash. Because it's dark and you've got people that are looking at the eclipse. Are you going to flash blind them? Should everyone try to see a total solar eclipse? Joe Rao It should be on everybody's bucket list, and if you don't have a total eclipse of the sun on your bucket list, I personally will take a giant pencil with an eraser and erase something from off that bucket list and add total eclipse of the sun, because everybody, as they say, has to see it.

"2","For the uninitiated, college basketball may seem like a complicated sport. Nearly every second is packed with plays, screens, cuts, and defenses that can be hard to follow. Commentators spray you with names and phrases that you’re supposed to already know. ( Izzo ? Geno ? The 1-3-1 ? Pac-12 ?) And let’s not even get started on advanced metrics, unless you can explain usage rate . But if you’ve ever wanted to see basketball beautifully simplified — as clean as putting a ball through the hoop — all you need to do is watch Caitlin Clark, the 22-year-old superstar making headlines with the Iowa Hawkeyes. In both the men’s and women’s college game, there has never been a more prolific scorer than Clark, no shooter as flashy. She’s the record-breaking scoring leader among all Division I college basketball players in NCAA history, smashing “Pistol Pete” Maravich’s more than 50-year-old record this season. Clark’s gaudy numbers and the manner in which she scores — pulling up from anywhere in the gym, no matter the distance — have brought mainstream attention to women’s college basketball, a sport historically eclipsed by its men’s counterpart. The spot where Caitlin Clark broke the NCAA women’s scoring record at Carver- Hawkeye Arena Matthew Holst/Getty Images Her impact is being called the Caitlin Clark Effect. The Hawkeyes sold out their season tickets for their entire home schedule for the first time in school history, and Iowa’s road games have set attendance bests for opposing schools. Tickets for Iowa’s first two March Madness games, which begin on Saturday, sold out in 30 minutes . Earlier this month, her game against Ohio State — in which she broke Maravich’s aforementioned record — was watched by nearly 4 million TV viewers , the highest for a regular-season women’s basketball game (i.e., no championships involved) since 1999. On April 1, Clark led her Hawkeyes to their second consecutive Final Four. They defeated defending champion LSU 94-87 , avenging a loss in last year’s national championship game. Clark is the exception among her exceptional peers, and it isn’t just because of her incredible long-range shot. It’s that she knows what makes basketball exciting. She sees the spotlight and the pressure, the wins and the heartbreaks as a privilege, and she has embraced being both a hero and a villain. That’s what allows her to be the most thrilling player in college basketball. How Caitlin Clark changed women’s basketball Over the past four years, Caitlin Clark has scored 3,900 points — the most for a player of any gender in Division I college basketball. That list includes male Hall of Famers like Maravich and Larry Bird as well as Brittney Griner , Maya Moore , Elena Delle Donne , and Chamique Holdsclaw , some of the best women’s players of all time. Beginning her freshman season in 2020, Clark averaged 26.6 points per game and has upped that number each year to reach her current 31.9 as a senior. That stunning stat goes along with 8.9 assists per game and 7.3 rebounds. She’s currently shooting nearly 50 percent from the field, 38 percent from three, and 86 percent from the free throw line. Those numbers are stellar, but basketball is a team sport, and Clark’s play elevates the Hawkeyes as a whole. Clark is a scoring point guard. That means she touches the ball virtually every single time Iowa comes down the court on offense. Whether it’s shooting or setting up her teammates, getting points on the board is her responsibility. Opposing teams know this and go into each contest with the goal of shutting her down, playing Clark with lots of physicality and throwing double and even triple teams at her. Yet all season, she’s been scoring at a high clip and doing so with efficiency. Her gravitational pull has also freed up her teammates: When opponents double-team Clark, it leaves at least one of her fellow Hawkeyes open, allowing them more space for cuts to the basket. With this assist Caitlin Clark of ⁦ @IowaWBB ⁩ becomes the ⁦ @B1Gwbball ⁩ all-time leader in assists with 902, passing Samantha Prahalis of Ohio State. pic.twitter.com/dKyHg9hmfr — angieholmes (@angieholmes) December 30, 2023 Clark’s offense has changed the Iowa program, bringing the team close to an NCAA championship. Three years ago, during her freshman season, Clark and the Hawkeyes overachieved to make the NCAA Sweet 16 as a No. 5 seed, upsetting Kentucky before losing to UConn. Two years ago, Clark helped Iowa win the Big 10 tournament and clinch a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. Last year, she made program history and brought Iowa to the national championship game, beating the overall favorite South Carolina before losing in the final game to LSU. After a remarkable 2023–2024 season and another Big 10 tournament win, Iowa’s women’s team got a No. 1 seed for March Madness — just the third time in program history — and is ranked second overall . Taking the Hawkeyes to the national championship last year and getting them poised for another deep tourney run is an especially remarkable achievement when you consider the composition of the Iowa squad. CAITLIN CLARK FROM THE LOGO‼️ pic.twitter.com/KVkXZPtVnO — The Players' Tribune (@PlayersTribune) April 1, 2023 Clark’s teammates weren’t highly ranked All-Americans in high school, the primary evaluation of how good an incoming college player is compared to her cohort. While ESPN ranked Clark herself fourth in the 2020 class, her next- best teammate, Hannah Stuelke, was ranked 45 coming out of high school and averaged 6.5 points per game in the 2022–2023 season. Clark is the only five- star recruit on Iowa’s roster. By comparison, South Carolina, the top-ranked team heading into the tournament, is littered with highly rated players. Sophomore Raven Johnson was ranked second and named the Women’s Basketball Coach’s Association high school player of the year going into college. There’s also senior Kamilla Cardoso , who was ranked fifth on recruiting lists and was later named Freshman of the Year in her conference. There are many other stars, including Te-Hina Paopao , Bree Hall , and Milaysia Fulwiley . To be clear, Clark isn’t a perfect player. Her defense is improving, but she and Iowa would much prefer to outscore their opponents than lock them down defensively. Iowa gives up around 72 points per game to its opponents, while teams like South Carolina, UConn, and Texas don’t let their rivals hit 60. Plus, coach Lisa Bluder’s failure to find Clark a blue-chip teammate or two throughout her college career is probably the reason why Iowa didn’t win the championship last year and still isn’t the favorite to win this year. But Clark is special because her massive offensive talent makes her team better and allows Iowa to compete with more talented rosters. As Iowa has shown us this year and last, anything can happen with her on the floor. Caitlin Clark isn’t afraid to be a star (or a villain) Clark makes you feel like you’re watching magic. That’s why so many people, even some women’s basketball naysayers, are so interested. Women’s basketball is often negatively compared to the men’s game. With the rim at the same height regardless of gender, men can make more athletic plays (dunks, putbacks, alley-oops) closer to the basket due to their height and strength. In the paint and on fast breaks, women’s basketball isn’t going to look as glitzy as the men’s. But physical advantages don’t have a bearing on shooting and court vision, and that’s where Clark excels. Clark regularly pulls up from beyond the 3-point line, sometimes even a step or two over half court (the vaunted “logo” three ), and sinks them. The farther she shoots from, the more spectacular the basket. Her shooting range has inspired the next generation of women’s basketball players, and helped her ink lucrative NIL (name, image, and likeness) deals with brands like Nike, Gatorade, and State Farm. Clark and Iowa, as the Wall Street Journal discussed , have been part of the most-watched women’s basketball games on six different networks . Her countless fans also include Steph Curry, arguably the best men’s shooter of all time . “When you watch them play, she just adds the element of surprise that you can’t really game-plan for,” Curry told ESPN last March. Caitlin Clark is ridiculous. Logo shot and another monster game. 46 PTS 10 AST 4 REB 3 STL (via @IowaWBB ) pic.twitter.com/mkMj4wTjRn — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 7, 2022 In a sport where women are told they can’t do the things men do, Clark defies expectations. Not that many men’s college basketball stars shoot from where Clark does and with her confidence. That belief in herself adds to the spectacle of her games. Like other greats before her, Clark is unafraid to be both the hometown hero and the visiting villain. She’s extremely fun to cheer on, especially if you’re an Iowa fan; she’s also extremely fun to root against and beat if you’re not. Last year during the NCAA tournament, Clark employed John Cena’s “ You can’t see me ” gesture in a win over Louisville . Clark tallied a triple double — 41 points, 12 assists, 10 rebounds — and sank eight 3-pointers, suggesting that Louisville, in fact, did not see her. In her Final Four win against South Carolina, Clark waved off an opposing player, daring them to shoot. Said player didn’t shoot. That clip went viral, with some fans calling the play disrespectful (positive and funny) and others calling it disrespectful (negative and unfunny). In the championship game, LSU returned the favor by sinking 64 percent of its 3s . Angel Reese, the LSU star who goes by the nickname “Bayou Barbie,” gave Clark some of her own medicine and taunted her as the game came to a close. Clark had nothing but compliments for Reese and LSU after the game. When Caitlin Clark walks into the building, she’s in range. Steven Branscombe/Getty Images Clark next faces a very talented UConn team in the Final Four, and if she and the Hawkeyes advance they could face the undefeated South Carolina team or the third-seeded NC State Wolfpack in the final. Whether Clark finishes the season with a loss or a national championship, it’ll be her last one as a college player. She announced that she’ll move onto the WNBA despite having one year of eligibility left for college ball. Experts have already weighed in on how valuable she’ll be as a pro. If she continues on her current trajectory, barring injury, she’ll likely challenge for a WNBA championship and Olympic gold. Her professional career hasn’t even begun, and there’s still so much to be written. Caitlin Clark’s next game: Final Four Iowa vs. UConn at 9:30 pm ET on April 5, 2024 Update, April 2, 10:45 am ET: This story was originally published on March 22 and has been updated to include the Hawkeyes’ advancement to the Final Four.

"2","In spring 2022, just months before the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , Republicans in Florida passed a law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, down from the previous legal threshold of 24 weeks. It took effect that summer, but advocates for reproductive rights challenged it in state court as unconstitutional. One year later, Republicans in Florida took even more aggressive action against reproductive freedom: Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a new bill to restrict abortion at six weeks of pregnancy. But the fate of that law rested on what the court would decide about the 15-week ban. If it decided that ban was legal, the six-week ban would be, too. This week, nearly two years after challengers first filed their lawsuit, the Florida Supreme Court finally issued its ruling: The 15-week ban is constitutional under state law, and therefore the six-week ban will take effect in 30 days, on May 1. In practical terms, six weeks is a total ban. Many people do not even know they’re pregnant by then. Even if they are aware, Florida requires patients seeking abortions to complete two in-person doctor visits with a 24-hour waiting period in between, a challenging logistical burden to meet before 15 weeks and a nearly impossible one before six. Not only will the six-week ban decimate abortion access for Florida residents, but it will also significantly curtail care for people across the South, who have been traveling to Florida from more restrictive states since Roe was overturned. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group, there were 8,940 more abortions in Florida in 2023 compared to 2020—a 12 percent increase that researchers attribute largely to travel from out-of-state patients. Residents of Florida’s bordering states face either a total ban (Alabama) or a six-week ban (Georgia). More broadly, the Guttmacher Institute has found that six-week bans have massive impacts on the provision of abortion. In South Carolina, the number of abortions provided in the formal health care system decreased by 71 percent the month after the state started enforcing a six-week ban on abortions in 2023. Prior research found declines of close to 50 percent in abortion caseloads in Georgia and in Texas after their six-week bans went into effect. Florida’s six-week abortion ban is particularly restrictive When the six-week ban takes effect next month, Florida will become one of the most restrictive states in the country on abortion access. Florida’s law not only bans abortion after six weeks but also bans abortion by telemedicine and requires any medication abortion to be dispensed in person, which effectively outlaws mail orders of the pills. (Researchers have affirmed there is no medical need for abortion pills to be administered in the physical presence of a health care provider.) At the time it was passed, no other state had a six- week ban with a requirement for two in-person doctor visits and no option for telehealth. While the law includes exceptions for rape and incest, it requires anyone claiming those exceptions to provide a copy of a police report, medical record, or court order — even though victims often do not involve law enforcement. The executive director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence has called these exceptions “meaningless” and “harmful.” Six weeks is simply not enough time for the vast majority of people to get abortion care, especially if remote options are off the table. In medical terms, pregnancy is measured from the date of the last menstrual period, not from the date of conception, and up to 25 percent of women don’t have regular menstrual cycles, meaning a missed period wouldn’t signal anything unusual. It can take at least three weeks for a pregnancy hormone to appear on a home pregnancy test, and while blood tests can also confirm pregnancies, Florida health care professionals testified that it can take weeks to months to get an appointment with an OB-GYN, with wait times particularly long for low-income and Black Floridians. Once a pregnancy is confirmed, a patient, under Florida law, would need to schedule an ultrasound with an abortion provider. Scheduling these appointments takes even more time. Annie Filkowski, the policy director of Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, told Vox in 2023 that wait times at their clinics average about 20 days. These barriers would prove virtually insurmountable for most people, and even harder for minors in Florida, who are required by law to either get parental consent to end a pregnancy or petition a judge to bypass their parents. The Republican state senator who sponsored the six-week ban, Erin Grall, conceded a teenager would be unlikely to go through that legal process within six weeks. “I think the purpose of this bill is to say that when there is life, we are going to protect it,” Grall said. “There are 4.6 million women of reproductive age in Florida, along with trans and nonbinary people who may need an abortion,” said Kelly Baden, the vice president of public policy at the Guttmacher Institute. “With the regional clustering of bans in neighboring and nearby states, Floridians will have to travel across at least two state lines to get care after six weeks.” Kris Lawler, the board president of the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund, announced Monday that their network stands ready to help people access care in the wake of this decision. “Abortion is essential healthcare, and while they might make it significantly harder to do so, no politician can stop us from accessing our basic right to abortion,” they said. Florida provides critical reproductive health care for people throughout the South The abortion bans in Florida will add strain to an already restrictive landscape that people in neighboring states like Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama have been contending with since the overturn of Roe. When the six-week ban takes effect, people in the South will need to travel even farther for care. In 2023, North Carolina reduced access to legal abortion from 20 weeks down to 12, and also passed rules requiring patients to make two in-person doctor visits, with a 72-hour break in between. The only Southern state that allows abortion past the first trimester is Virginia, and beyond that the closest options are Washington, DC, and Illinois. Total incidence of abortion has actually gone up since the overturn of Roe v. Wade , but an underlying reason is because travel out of state for abortion has also gone up, offsetting some of the newer restrictions in states with bans. Yet such travel is difficult and expensive, and it’s no guarantee that every patient looking to end a pregnancy will all be able to make a trip that’s hundreds of miles longer than before. Florida voters could overturn the bans in November One glimmer of hope for people in Florida and the entire South is a second ruling the Florida Supreme Court issued on Monday : A ballot measure to protect abortion access in the state can move forward. The measure, which would require support from at least 60 percent of Florida voters to pass, would amend Florida’s constitution to protect abortion rights up to the point of fetal viability, or typically between 22 and 24 weeks of a pregnancy. Voters will have the opportunity to weigh in on this question in November. Past polling indicates extreme abortion restrictions are not supported by the Florida public. In one survey conducted by Florida Atlantic University, 67 percent of Floridians said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while just 12 percent supported a total ban. Another survey from 2023, led by the Public Religion Research Institute, found 64 percent of Americans backed abortion in all or most cases. All seven ballot measures that have been advanced to protect abortion rights since the fall of Roe have passed. But those in red and purple states like Montana, Kentucky, Kansas, and Ohio did not have to reach a 60 percent threshold, receiving backing between 52 and 59 percent. Advocates for abortion rights expect the Florida campaign to be particularly expensive, running upwards of $100 million. “It has never been more essential that the right to abortion be enshrined in the state constitution to protect access for Floridians and that we elect federal champions to protect the right to abortion at the national level,” said Reproductive Freedom for All President Mini Timmaraju. “We’re committed to working beside our partners on the ground to ensure that happens.” Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, said the Supreme Court’s decision “paves the way for Florida voters to stop these ridiculous abortion bans once and for all.” Update, April 2, 2024, 3:35 pm: This story was originally published on April 5, 2023, and has been updated multiple times. Most recently, significant changes were made following the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling that the 15-week abortion ban is constitutional. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Shōgun , FX’s period drama-action series on Hulu , has drawn comparisons to Game of Thrones , thanks to its shocking violence, like people pulling out their own guts with swords and others being boiled alive slowly. Unlike that brutal flight of fantasy, however, Shōgun is based on the 1975 historical novel of the same name by James Clavell — which was inspired by true events during the late Sengoku period (1467–1615) in Japan. In other words, there’s something real to this horror. This time was ripe to be fictionalized, defined by civil wars among different liege lords across the land — called daiymō — and social upheaval. In the show and book, John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis), a rough-mannered English sailor, washes up on the shores of a Japanese fishing village and finds himself helping the frightening and strategic Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada), who aims to win control of Japan, end the infighting, and become shōgun, a military dictator. While the events are dramatic, the history the show is anchored in is quite real. Blackthorne is based on William Adams , the first Englishman to reach Japan, and Toranaga is based on Tokugawa Ieyasu , whose shogunate ushered in the Tokugawa period, which is known as a time of economic growth and internal stability after generations of feuding samurai clans. Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), a powerful and graceful Christian Japanese noblewoman who is Blackthorne’s translator (and love interest), is inspired by the very real Hosokawa Gracia , who served a critical role in Tokugawa’s war. In the show, Mariko is somewhat loyal to the Catholic Portuguese missionaries who converted her (although ultimately she gives near-total obedience to her liege lord, Toranaga). Blackthorne, a Protestant, worries that Mariko’s loyalties to the Portuguese will interfere with their budding romantic connection, not to mention his reliance on her as one of the few people in Japan who serve as his translator. In an attempt to make his Japanese captors/hosts distrust his Catholic Portuguese rivals, Blackthorne dramatically reveals to Toranaga and Mariko that the Portuguese aim to colonize Japan, and that they already have colonies in Macau, shocking the Japanese nobility. This is a piece of colonial history in East Asia we rarely see in the mainstream media, so let’s unpack it. What’s the real story of Portuguese presence in Japan? Did the Portuguese try to colonize Japan? Yes. Because of the fierceness of the warrior class and Japan’s distance from Europe, the Portuguese didn’t have the ability to conquer Japan through force, the way they did in places like Brazil and parts of India . Instead, they used religious conversion and trade to try to accomplish a cultural and economic conversion, exploiting the fractious nature of the warring lords to expand their trade routes. In fact, Japan still bears marks of Portuguese contact. As Morgan Pitelka , professor at UNC Chapel Hill and expert on late medieval and early modern Japan, notes some Japanese food dishes have names derived from Portuguese, like pan for bread, karumeira for caramel, and hasuteira for pie crust. Other sources even attribute the name and recipe for the Japanese dish tempura to the Portuguese, although Pitelka says that is up for debate. “If you think about conversion as a colonizing mission ... someone is saying ‘Your religion is wrong, come over to our religion” Some might think that the lack of military force means there was no attempt at colonization, but it’s important to understand that conquering a society doesn’t always require armies. “If you think about conversion as a colonizing mission, it means someone is saying ‘Your religion is wrong, come over to our religion,” says Nicole Freiner , associate professor of Political Science at Bryant University and author of The Social and Gender Politics of Confucian Nationalism: Women and the Japanese Nation-State . “The records say that the Portuguese probably converted thousands of Japanese. Even though the Tokugawa shōguns tried to eliminate all Christianity, it did persist.” So, yes the Portuguese did try to colonize Japan. They just weren’t successful, ultimately. And we’ll get to why they weren’t successful later. Did the Portuguese enslave Japanese people? The show has not yet made mention of this history, but it did happen. To get more clarity, we spoke to Liam Brockey , professor of Early Modern Europe and historical consultant on the 2016 Martin Scorsese film Silence , which is about two 17th-century Portuguese Jesuit priests who travel from the Portuguese colony in Macau to Japan to find a missing missionary and spread Christianity in Japan. Brockey says that there are “concrete references to Portuguese buying slaves in Japan .” The Portuguese also captured and paid for enslaved people from China and Korea. According to Pitelka, many of those enslaved people ended up in Macau, now an autonomous region on the south coast of China. In the show, when Blackthorne plays the hero and informs Lord Toranaga and Mariko that the Portuguese have a colony there, the Japanese nobility are shocked. But in reality, this was not only common knowledge but was actually encouraged by Japan’s rulers who saw the Portuguese as beneficial to their economy — for a time, anyway. Brockey says enslaved Japanese sometimes ended up as far away as Portuguese colonies in India , such as Goa and Cochin, or they were moved and sold again elsewhere in East Asia. Brockey says this was a “vibrant slave trade,” but with a few differences from the trans -Atlantic slave trade of West and Central Africans. “There was an understanding in Japan and China that you could make enough money at some point to repurchase your freedom.” However, he stresses it was not indentured servitude, but slavery. Did the Portuguese and British fight over Japan? It is this backdrop of attempted colonization that forms much of Blackthorne’s journey as an Englishman in Japan. The show opens by saying, “For decades, Portuguese Catholics have richly profited from trade in Japan. They have kept its whereabouts hidden from their sworn enemies — the European Protestants.” While Adams’s letters to his English wife back up that they were in search of the “East Indies,” it’s not true that the location was completely hidden. Brockey says that maps printed by Dutch cartographers in the late 1500s clearly showed where Japan was. “Where Japan laid was no secret. But how to get there, and how to get past all of the fortifications that the Portuguese built between Europe and East Asia, was a totally different challenge,” he said. Letters from Adams to his English wife — Adams stayed in Japan for the rest of his life and started a Japanese family — show that he considered landing there to be a great achievement and the ambitious daiymō Iyeasu to be a prized ally. “I showed unto [Tokugawa Ieyasu] the name of our country, and that our land long sought out the East Indies, and desired friendship with all kings and potentates in way of merchandise, having in our land diverse commodities which these lands had not,” Adams wrote to his wife . Blackthorne (Jarvis, center) is based on Englishman William Adams, while Toda Mariko (Sawai, right) is based on Japanese noblewoman Hosokawa Gracia. Lord Toranaga (Sanada) looms large over both. FX on Hulu According to Pitelka, the portrayal of Blackthorne’s extreme animosity toward the Portuguese sailors and missionaries and his race to make himself and the Protestants the center of trade there reflects the times, when conflict between Catholics and Protestants engulfed Europe after Martin Luther’s Reformation movement began in in 1517. Pitelka says these conflicts were not just about religion. They were about money. “This is the moment when capitalism is beginning. The corporations that are formed through these explorations of the world — the Dutch East India Company and British East India Company — are the first capitalist corporations, and they are partially sponsored by their governments,” he tells Vox. However, the show implies through Blackthorne’s accusations and warnings to Toranaga that the British and Dutch alliance have more innocent aims in Japan, which isn’t true. The British didn’t have good intentions for East Asia, but they were more focused on conquering land and trade routes in South and Southeast Asia. “Their goal was to extract resources from the rest of the world to conquer to create colonies so that they could keep fighting in Europe. It’s the dysfunction in Europe, the fact that they’re all constantly waging war with each other that drives this colonial expansion around the world,” Pitelka explains. “The Spanish and the Portuguese are in Asia because they want to either enslave people or find gold and silver, or take spices and porcelain and silk back to Europe and sell it to beat their rivals. The English and the Dutch are exactly the same way.” And Pitelka confirms that this colonization was happening in multiple arenas — through trade domination, religious conversion, and military conquest/expansion. “[Blackthorne’s] animosity toward the Portuguese and the Spanish and their animosity towards him is one of the most accurate parts of the show,” he says. And in the end, Adams got his way. “He encouraged the Dutch to send trading ships to Japan and they were eventually able to do so in 1609,” Pitelka says, adding that for the rest of the Tokugawa period, the Dutch Protestants replaced the Portuguese Catholics as the primary European trading partners in Japan. After the Shimabara Rebellion — an uprising of Japanese Catholics — in the late 1630s, the non-Christian Japanese rulers set limits their to Christian power, and the Portuguese were banned from trading in Japan. Was seppuku common? One historical practice raising eyebrows and questions in Shōgun is seppuku — a Japanese form of ritual suicide by disembowelment, which plays a huge role in shaping the story. In the first episode, one of Toranaga’s vassals speaks out of turn at a meeting, causing conflict. His solution when he realizes his mistake is to immediately offer to kill himself and his infant son, ending his family’s line. He and the other vassals are even annoyed at his wife, Fuji (Moeka Hoshi), for protesting her son’s murder; she, in turn, never expresses any anger at her husband or her liege lord for their responsibility in his death. But was seppuku really this brutal or common as the show makes it seem? And did those who were commanded to perform it or watch their family members perform it put up so little dissent? Pitelka says that we shouldn’t think of it as commonplace, but rare due to the exclusivity of the samurai class , who were military nobility. “In this period, the samurai are probably less than 6 or 7 percent of the population. And only the most elite of the samurai were obsessed by issues of honor and status to the degree that they would pursue seppuku.” However, he says that among this small group, seppuku was a real practice that happened the way it’s depicted in both Clavell’s book and the show. “There’s a famous example from the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu,” he says, “who’s the real warlord Toranaga is based on, where his son did something to disgrace him and he ordered his son, and his son’s mother — who was his wife — to kill themselves.” Tokugawa Ieyasu’s “son did something to disgrace him and he ordered his son, and his son’s mother — who was his wife — to kill themselves” As far as willingness to kill yourself whenever a lord told you to, Pitelka says seppuku was preferable, because by the time it was commanded, death was certain anyway. “The only alternative to seppuku was execution,” he says. “The idea is you have shamed yourself. Rather than being executed where your power over your life is taken away, they are respecting your position as a samurai and letting you take your own life, which in the samurai code of honor, is a better way to die than a firing squad.” Pitelka says there wasn’t a lot of pushback because this was “a profoundly militaristic society,” without “any notion of individual liberties or freedom.” This matches the world Shōgun portrays, where Toranaga has absolute control, and we see minimal negotiation or rebellion. Pitelka points out a torture scene from the beginning of the show, where an English soldier is slowly boiled alive until he dies. And when you put it that way, it makes sense why someone might choose seppuku. Why did the Portuguese not ultimately succeed in colonizing Japan? Well, the answer to that not only lies in how difficult it was to get to Japan from Europe, but also the military culture characterized by seppuku. Pitelka stresses that the distance of Japan shielded it from much of the “cancerous European expansion and extraction” that other countries endured. “There was never a full naval invasion of Japan by Europeans. At most, they could send one ship with some priests and merchants per year. Some years they couldn’t do it at all because the ship sank, so the ship got stuck someplace.” But it wasn’t just geography. Daiymō and the shōgun had absolute power over their people, and Japan was a military dictatorship where resistance meant death. Pitelka tells Vox that “the attempts to penetrate that did occur encountered fierce displays of strength and a very strong desire to protect Japan from outsiders.” While the show depicts the Japanese nobility as being shocked and then passive about Portuguese expansion, they actually began to grow deeply disturbed at the pressure to convert and the Portuguese accumulation of silver. “Japan was one of the main sources of silver in the world at this time. So they wanted to protect their economy as well,” Pitelka says. “And once the samurai started to learn that the European Catholic nations were invading and conquering other countries like the Philippines, they immediately realized this was dangerous and they had to isolate and control the Europeans.” It was the frightening violence, the control, and the military skill that Shōgun depicts that enabled the Japanese to do that. Pitelka stresses, however, that we still shouldn’t glorify the samurai or shōguns, because they were military dictators who were very cruel to lower classes, and their legacy has often been used for more disturbing projects of Japanese nationalism, like the occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 or the current attempts to remilitarize its own society . It’s a sobering reminder that our history should never be used to justify going backward in the present. But it is rich material for one of the best new shows of the year.

"2","An Israeli airstrike Monday killed seven aid workers who were delivering food to Palestinians on the brink of widespread famine in Gaza . The attack — whose victims were almost all foreign citizens and were with World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit run by Spanish American chef and humanitarian José Andrés — has drawn widespread international condemnation and underscored the risks that humanitarian workers take every day in trying to deliver still-insufficient levels of aid to Gaza. “This is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war,” World Central Kitchen CEO Erin Gore said in a statement . “This is unforgivable.” The victims, who were wearing bulletproof vests bearing their organization’s logo , were from Australia, Poland, the United Kingdom, Palestine, and the US and Canada. ( Israel has acknowledged the incident , which it called an accident , and expressed its “condolences” to the families.) World Central Kitchen has paused operations in Gaza as a result of the attack, both threatening one of the few sources for food aid in Gaza and highlighting the challenges humanitarian workers are facing as Israel threatens to escalate its assault with an invasion of the southern city of Rafah and continues to obstruct the delivery of aid. According to the Aid Worker Security database , 260 aid workers were killed across Gaza and the West Bank last year and 60 this year so far. “The attack that happened yesterday isn’t something that happened in isolation. There has been a pattern of attacks against humanitarian aid operations and facilities as well as medical workers and facilities throughout this conflict,” said Ciarán Donnelly, the International Rescue Committee’s senior vice president for crisis, response, recovery, and development. What we know about the attack To understand the import of the work of World Central Kitchen and other aid groups right now, you have to understand what’s happening in Gaza: Projections indicate that by July, half of its population will face an entirely avoidable famine — one that has no natural causes and that has accelerated faster than anything else seen this century. Just weeks ago, World Central Kitchen established a makeshift jetty to facilitate maritime aid deliveries while the US government worked to construct a temporary pier in Gaza. Though the United Nations delivers about 80 percent of the aid that has been going to Gaza, World Central Kitchen was responsible for more than half of the remaining aid deliveries , primarily food, before Monday’s attack. As of mid-March, the organization had sent 200 tons of food to Gaza. The nonprofit said it had informed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that its team would be traveling in a deconflicted zone in two armored cars branded with its logo and one non-armored vehicle. Israeli missiles nevertheless struck the convoy three times after it left a warehouse in Deir al-Balah, an area in central Gaza where there is a United Nations refugee camp and where the workers had unloaded more than 100 tons of food aid. The IDF referred Vox to a video statement by its spokesperson Daniel Hagari when asked why it struck the convoy, what evidence it had to support doing so, and how it would work to facilitate the delivery of more aid to Gaza now that World Central Kitchen is stepping back. Hagari said in the statement that the IDF was “reviewing the incident at the highest levels” and that he had spoken with Andrés to express condolences. “As a professional military committed to international law, we are committed to examining our operations thoroughly and transparently,” he said. He did not offer details on the decision-making behind the strikes or deny that the IDF knew that it was targeting World Central Kitchen vehicles. Haaretz reports that its sources say the IDF suspected an armed Hamas operative was traveling in the convoy. That did not turn out to be the case. In a video statement to the Times of Israel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Hebrew, “It was an unintentional hit on innocent civilians. Those things happen in wartime. We are conducting an investigation.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday in Paris that Biden administration officials had spoken to the Israeli government about the incident. “We’ve urged a swift, a thorough, an impartial investigation to understand exactly what happened. And as we have throughout this conflict, we’ve impressed upon the Israelis the absolute imperative of doing more to protect innocent civilian lives … as well as to get more humanitarian assistance to more people, more effectively,” he said. The consequences In January, the International Court of Justice issued a ruling requiring Israel to step up its efforts to facilitate the delivery of aid to Gaza. Those efforts have not visibly materialized. Some critics have raised concerns in the past about World Central Kitchen’s approach to its workers’ safety , which has sometimes involved thrusting them into disaster zones without much preparation. But this strike is emblematic of a larger pattern in Gaza. In addition to the World Central Kitchen workers, those killed since the start of the war include five staff members for Doctors Without Borders (MSF), an NGO providing health care in Gaza, and 14 on-duty staff members for the Palestinian Red Crescent. Both groups have decades of experience working in war zones. Humanitarian infrastructure, such as hospitals and refugee camps, has been under continued Israeli bombardment since the start of the war. As of March 1, only 12 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals were even partially functional , and those that were open still suffered from critical shortages of medical supplies. Food infrastructure, such as bakeries and flour mills , has also been destroyed. (The IDF recently withdrew from al-Shifa hospital, alleging it had arrested more than 500 suspected militants , while leaving behind hundreds of bodies and a “trail of destruction,” per CNN .) Israel has also continued to restrict aid deliveries despite claiming that it does not block aid. Oxfam published a report recently accusing Israel of deliberately doing so, noting that aid trucks must wait an average of 20 days to enter and that Israel has rejected a warehouse’s worth of supplies, including oxygen, incubators, water, and sanitation equipment. Gaza is “both one of the most dangerous and one of the most restrictive spaces we’ve operated in for quite some time,” said Donnelly, of the International Rescue Committee. The consequences for the population of Gaza are dire. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University project that by August, absent a ceasefire, the number of excess deaths in Gaza — including from disease outbreaks — could reach nearly 67,000 if the status quo continues and exceed 85,000 if there’s an escalation in the conflict. And an escalation in Rafah remains possible: Though Israel has agreed to take US concerns about an invasion into account, it’s not yet clear whether it will postpone the offensive or abandon it altogether. This is prompting allegations that Israel is deliberately using starvation as a weapon of war, which would constitute a war crime. One senior member of Netanyahu’s Likud party has called these allegations “total nonsense” and “irresponsible.” Any such alleged war crimes are difficult to prove and require lengthy litigation; Israel is already facing a case at the International Court of Justice accusing it of committing genocide in Gaza, which won’t be resolved for years. But what is clear is that Israel’s tactics in Gaza correlate with an abominable death toll, which now exceeds 33,000 , and its screening policies for aid deliveries are effectively starving Palestinians. Intentional or not, the consequences are undeniably grim. Monday’s attack will make it even harder for aid workers to address the deepening disaster. The risks to staff are already proving too high for the United Arab Emirates, which is reportedly ceasing involvement in the maritime aid corridor to Gaza until Israel can assure the safety of its workers. “​The only way to provide safety and aid for Palestinian civilians, the only way to provide space for agencies to operate at the scale that we need to given the severity of the needs, is for the fighting to end,” Donnelly said.

"2","Even as the fighting has raged in Gaza , a question has hung over the war: Would it escalate into a wider regional conflict involving Iran , its various proxy groups, and perhaps even the US military? Nearly six months after October 7, it’s a mixed picture. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have played a much larger role in the conflict than most observers expected , up to the point of meaningfully disrupting international shipping. But early fears that a full-scale war with Lebanon-based Hezbollah would break out on Israel’s “northern front” or that the Iranian government itself would get directly involved haven’t materialized. Nonetheless, Monday marked a major step up the escalator ladder. Warplanes, presumably Israeli , carried out an airstrike in Damascus, Syria, which killed a senior Iranian general , Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who was deeply involved in his government’s activities in Syria and Lebanon. He is the highest-ranking Iranian military officer killed by enemy fire since Gen. Qassem Soleimani was killed by a US drone strike in 2020. Per its general practice with strikes in Syria, Israel has not officially acknowledged the attack, but four Israeli officials, speaking anonymously, confirmed their involvement to the New York Times. Iran claims that the building that was struck was a consulate facility that was also used as its ambassador’s residence, but the anonymous Israeli officials denied that it had diplomatic status. Iran’s President, Ebrahim Raisi, vowed that the strike “would not go unpunished,” and Iran-backed Hezbollah has vowed retaliation. US officials claim to have had no advanced knowledge or involvement in the strike — according to some reports, they were told only generally that there would be upcoming activity in Syria — but Iranian officials nonetheless say they are holding the US responsible. Iran’s response may not be immediate, but the strike will nonetheless contribute to regional tensions that were already at the boiling point — and there’s a good chance American troops in the Middle East may be in the firing line. Iran’s man in Damascus Zahedi was a significant figure in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its efforts to project power throughout the region. At one point, he commanded the IRGC’s air force, but he’s better known for his work as a liaison to both Hezbollah and Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, which is allied with Iran. He was the only non-Lebanese citizen to sit on Hezbollah’s Shura Council, the group’s main decision-making body. The strike also killed six other senior leaders of the Quds Force — the branch of the IRGC responsible for operations outside Iran — including Zahedi’s chief of staff and the commander for Palestine . As such, Israel not only severed a key link between Tehran and its foreign proxies, but also removed several of the men who might have been in line to replace him. It’s a significant hit to the IRGC’s operations, but how much of a setback is it, really? Suzanne Maloney , an expert on Iran and director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution, pointed out that many expected Iran’s network to take a blow after Soleimani was killed. Instead, “it’s arguable that today, Iran’s coordination of its various proxy militias in the Middle East is stronger than it was even in Soleimani’s heyday,” Maloney told Vox. “Killing influential figures in Iran’s military establishment doesn’t necessarily produce the corresponding desired impact of degrading Iran’s capabilities in the region. In some respects, it may only harden Iran’s commitment and that of the various proxies.” How will Tehran respond? Whatever the operational impact, Iran will have to respond somehow, but it may be the US rather than Israel that bears the brunt of it. Charles Lister , director of the Syria and counterterrorism programs at the Middle East Institute, told Vox that “the most predictable option will be to lift the freeze on proxy attacks on US troops in Syria and Iraq. Basically, our troops in Iraq and Syria are seen by Iran as soft targets, but also targets that can indirectly place significant pressure on the Israelis.” In the weeks following the Hamas attacks on October 7 and in response to Israel’s war in Gaza, Iran- backed militias carried out dozens of rocket and drone strikes against US troops in the region. These culminated in a strike on January 29 that killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan. While the US response to the earlier strikes had been limited, after the deaths it responded much more aggressively with a strike in Baghdad that killed the leader of Kataib Hezbollah, the militia blamed for the Jordan attack. Since then, Iran’s proxies have dramatically scaled back their efforts, reportedly at Tehran’s request. That may now be changing. Shortly after the Damascus strike, US forces shot down a drone in the vicinity of the US garrison in al-Tanf, Syria, though it’s not clear if the drone was actually targeting the base. If it was, it would have been the first attack on US troops in the country in two months. Even before Monday, there were signs that Iran’s proxies were getting bolder in terms of attacking Israel itself. In the days before the bombing in Damascus, Iran- backed militias in Iraq took credit for two strikes on Israel — one on the southern port city of Eilat and one on a Christian village in Galilee. These attacks caused only light damage and no injuries. “The only thing that the Iranians haven’t yet done, which they could do but would be bold, would be to launch missiles from Iran itself at Israel,” said Lister. Though Iran’s proxies — most notably Hezbollah — have directly attacked Israeli soil and Iran has launched missiles at what it says was an Israeli intelligence facility in Iraq, it has also made very clear it has no desire for a direct shooting war with Israel, which it is in no position to win and could be devastating for its own regime and population. Maloney suspects this calculation has not changed, even after Zahedi’s killing. “Iran is prepared to fight Israel to the last Palestinian or the last Lebanese, but there would be a significant risk for them to try to mobilize any military response that can be directly attributable to them,” she said. “They’ve made an art form of avoiding direct war with Israel.” Washington’s dilemma Israel has been periodically bombing targets linked to Iran and Hezbollah in Syria for more than a decade to keep them from gaining a military foothold on its border. It has done this with the tacit acceptance of Russia , even though Moscow backs the Assad regime and maintains its air defense systems. But Israel also almost never publicly discusses these operations. “Israel wants to be able to conduct these operations without necessarily rubbing it in the nose of the Syrian government or the Russians or others,” Brian Finucane , a former State Department legal adviser now with the International Crisis Group, told Vox. “But that’s in tension with its obligations under international law, including its obligations under the UN Charter.” That’s because the charter prohibits the use of force against neighboring states except in cases of self-defense. Normally, Israel would be required to present its case to the UN for an attack against the territory of Syria and Iranian military officials was justified. The Trump administration at least made an attempt to do this after the Soleimani drone strike, which it argued was a response to an escalating series of attacks on US troops by Iranian militias, though many legal scholars were not convinced. Israel is unlikely to even try. Given that the attack was presumably carried out by US-supplied fighter jets — F-35s according to Iranian officials — this has implications for the US as well. “As a matter of US law, the Arms Export Control Act establishes an exhaustive list of purposes for which US arms may be transferred, with “legitimate self-defense” being the most pertinent,” said Finucane. A national security memorandum issued by the Biden administration in February also requires the secretary of state to obtain “credible and reliable” assurances that US-supplied weapons are being used in accordance with international law. “The US government needs to assess whether the strike was a prohibited use of force or lawful self-defense,” Finucane said. In the past, Israeli military actions like these have caused at least temporary ruptures in the US-Israel relationship. When Israel in 1981 bombed a nuclear reactor in Iraq with US-supplied aircraft, it took the incoming Reagan administration by surprise. The administration responded by backing a UN Security Council Resolution condemning the attack. It also temporarily suspended the sale of F-16 fighter jets. But in the current context, the event is likely to be just one more incident in a rapidly expanding conflict. It arguably wasn’t even the Israeli airstrike that garnered the most international attention yesterday — that would be a strike in Gaza that killed several international aid workers from the charity World Central Kitchen. For the moment at least, the Biden administration still looks set to approve several major new weapons sales to Israel including fighter jets and air-to-air missiles, even as criticism of the civilian toll in Gaza continues to grow. As for the long-term impact, the attack likely won’t turn the war in Gaza into a full-blown regional war overnight. But it’s another escalation in a region that can only bear so much. “Iran is nothing if not excellent at assessing risk ladders and escalation ladders,” said Lister. What we don’t know is just how high that ladder goes. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","I picture the economists who take part in the New York Times guest essays as people wearing loincloths, with painted faces, making their predictions after consulting with the sun king, following three days of fasting in the mountains, whilst feeding only on hallucinogenic mushrooms. The economist of reference there is Paul Krugman, famous for his political activism and scientific sloppiness, but often the others are even more insane than he is, if that is possible. I just read the essay “ I’m an Economist. Don’t Worry. Be Happy ,” and I fear that Justin Wolfers, its author, is a cross between Paulo Coelho and Nostradamus. If I understood it correctly, the central thesis of the article is that inflation is an optical illusion. That is, things are not more expensive, simply “the world has a lot more zeros in it, but nothing has really changed.” So you don’t have to worry about anything. Besides, I’m guessing that Wolfers figures that as he was taught at school that zero has no value, it doesn’t matter if you have one zero or 1,000 zeros, because they all amount to nothing. The professor defends that the state of panic that is settling in the public opinion due to inflation can be put down to some kind of mental disorder. Yes, he believes that those who have economic anxiety should go to their therapist to get help controlling their nervous system. According to the postmodern left, this is how things look: Biden, who has one foot in the grave and one foot in a parallel universe, does not need to see a specialist. Those who have “climate anxiety” are not crazy. Those who consider it reasonable to amputate their testicles to try to change sex do not need the help of a psychologist. On the other hand, the worker or the housewife who can no longer do the shopping they used to do at the supermarket because, quite simply, they cannot afford to thanks to the wild inflation that half the West is experiencing, needs to go to a psychiatrist to be convinced that it is not so bad, that it is just a matter of a few more unimportant zeros. It was foreseeable that it would come to this. The Left has gone mad to the point of no return. It is no longer enough for them to deny reality, or to mold it to their interests, they need to go one step beyond and, as happens with lunatics and drunks, blame everyone else for their delusions. The truth is that the madness that ails the progressives of our time is unhealthier than that which afflicted past progressives. Traditional crazies, like traditional drunks, used to tell the truth. But the insanity of the left does not involve truth- telling. In fact the New York Times essayist asserts that inflation is unimportant because wages are also going up just as commodities are going up. I bet a glance at your monthly paycheck is enough to disprove such a biased and mutilated assessment of the economic situation. All to avoid telling things like they are: that Biden is failing again and again in his attempts to contain inflation, and that, yes, the U.S. economy, like that of several large European countries that only just manage to survive under socialist or social democratic regimes, is the victim of a silent depression that left-wing governments insist on denying, as if that could change reality. I miss those madmen and drunks of yesteryear. Those who spoke the truth even if it was politically incorrect. Today’s progressive madness is more like a diabolical possession than a true mental derangement. They act like propaganda armies, they lack critical sense, and their only obsession is to silence the dissenter; and if the dissenter is not flesh and blood but is in fact reality itself (as is the case of supermarket price tags), then they try to silence the truth. An old Spanish joke, I don’t know if it has versions in other languages, tells of how a drunkard and a woman bump into each other on the street. The inebriated man spits out at her: “You are disgustingly ugly!” And the woman answers him angrily: “You are disgustingly drunk!” And the drunken man settles the dispute: “Yes, but I won’t be tomorrow!” As you can see, it is not so hard to show sanity even when you are crazy, nor to have a moment of lucidity in the middle of a drunken binge. Maybe our friend Wolfers should try it again. “Be happy” is the craziest advice I’ve ever heard from an economist. I wouldn’t be surprised if he read it on a coffee mug somewhere.

"1","Joe Biden once called Robert F. Kennedy “the man who I guess I admire more than anyone else in American politics.” The former attorney general’s namesake does not provoke similar feelings in the president. As Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Erin Burnett in a very fair — and therefore novel for cable news — and mesmerizing interview Monday evening, the Biden administration still refuses to give him (the son of an assassinated presidential candidate) Secret Service protection. While the interview did CNN (and the candidate) much credit, the distorted coverage of it told everyone what they already knew about the media. Though Kennedy offered, “I’m not going to answer that question,” in response to whether Donald Trump or Biden posed the bigger threat to democracy, many media outlets ignored that caveat and recrafted Kennedy saying he could make a case for Biden as him categorically labeling Biden the worse threat. He actually said: “I can make the argument that President Biden is a much worse threat to democracy, and the reason for that is President Biden is the first candidate in history — the first president in history that has used the federal agencies to censor political speech, so to censor his opponent. I can say that because I just won a case in the federal court of appeals and now before the Supreme Court that shows that he started censoring not just me — 37 hours after he took the oath of office — he was censoring me. No president of the country has ever done that. The greatest threat to democracy is not somebody who questions election returns but a president of the United States who uses the power of his office to force the social media companies — Facebook, Instagram, Twitter — to open a portal and give access to that portal to the FBI, to the CIA, to the IRS, to CISA, to NIH to censor his political critics.” Kennedy, despite sounding as though he’s 145-years-old and not the youngest of the five presidential candidates registering in polls, garners anywhere from 3 to 15 percent in recent national surveys. The candidate wondered to Burnett, “What president in history has ever tried to censor political opponents?” Few as brazenly as Joe Biden — and the federal government blocking Kennedy’s posts on ostensibly privately controlled social media sites undoubtedly motivates his run. But students of history grasp that Joe Biden did not merely plagiarize the speeches of President Kennedy and his attorney general. The Censorship State aggressively overseen by Joe Biden traces its genealogy to the same places Robert Kennedy Jr. traces his. During Kennedy’s uncle’s presidential administration, his father authorized warrantless wiretaps on various political enemies. Targets included a congressional staffer and lobbyists connected to efforts to restore sugar imports from the Dominican Republic. The president and his brother sicced the Central Intelligence Agency on several journalists who invoked the administration’s ire, including Pulitzer Prize–winner Hanson Baldwin of the New York Times . When an aide at a meeting attended by both the president and his attorney general suggested bypassing the FBI for the CIA in investigating these American citizens, John Kennedy responded : “That’s a very good idea. We’ll do that.” Matthew Dallek in Birchers: How the John Birch Society Radicalized the American Right wrote of Attorney General Robert Kennedy’s interest in the John Birch Society that “the FBI under his command opened an investigation of the movement with an extensive undercover operation.” This included Anti-Defamation League activists surreptitiously running credit reports on JBS members, posing as Birchers to join white supremacist groups, and transcribing license plates in parking lots outside of the group’s meetings. The ADL “Birch Watchers” sent reports to the FBI. Most infamously, President Kennedy and Attorney General Kennedy authorized bugging and other surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr., the results of which — like the dirt gathered on the Birchers — not-so mysteriously wound up in the hands of journalists. To put this in context, President Kennedy went down a trail blazed by predecessors Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, both of whom used wars as justifications to silence, harass, and bully political enemies. It did not start with John Kennedy and his brother Robert. The Biden administration’s censorship of RFK Jr. shows it did not end with them, either. Good for Robert Kennedy Jr. for highlighting the Censorship State on a cable channel long acting as its booster sheet. But to effectively fight something planted as deeply as the Censorship State, it helps when one can accurately trace its roots."
"1","Last week, the Canadian actress Ellen Page, who now goes by the name “Elliot” and claims to be a man, delivered a speech at the Juno Awards — Canada’s equivalent to the Grammys — in which she argued that “the rights of LGBTQ2+ people” are under attack. These “rights,” she asserted, are being “revoked, restricted and eliminated throughout the world.” Her speech drew headlines and corresponded with the release of the first clip from her new film, Close to You , in which Page plays a “transgender man” for the first time. Page has long been a famous actress, but her announcement of her transgenderism in December 2020 has turbocharged her fame and given her reason to be a leading activist on LGBTQ issues. This week, she was the headlining name on a statement signed by many Canadian celebrities to speak out against “Anti-Trans Legislation in Canada”; the statement expressed horror at provinces’ requirements that children obtain parental consent for a transgender identity. Page’s transgender identity also was the reason that Pageboy , her memoir, immediately topped the New York Times ’ bestseller list upon its release last year. Given Page’s increasing impact on the transgender movement, I picked up Pageboy to get an understanding of how she sees the ideology that she so adamantly subscribes to. What I found is an extremely credulous person in desperate need of help. She has suffered from anorexia and depression, was repeatedly sexually assaulted, and feels disgusted with her body. In the book, she embraces left-wing ideology with such enthusiasm that you could image even the most diehard leftists telling her that they never meant anyone to take it that far. In one chapter, in which she describes living at an environmental “learning center,” she informs her readers, with a deep seriousness, that we only have a short number of years left before the world will cease to exist due to the “climate crisis.” At another time, she claims that Hollywood does not lead the way when it comes to LGBTQ issues but follows far behind. Page adopts this same credulousness for leftist ideology in regard to the sexual revolution. She has fully bought into the idea that the purpose of life is to seek sexual pleasure with various people, as the bulk of her memoir is a scattered listing of her sexual escapades in an incoherent timeline. In describing all of these relationships, she is desperate to prove that she has sexual desires. Interspersed in these dragging descriptions of her sexual relationships — many of which have no dimension to them apart from lust, a fact that she acknowledges — are attempts to retroactively project her newfound transgender identity onto her past. Early on, Page describes her joy at being mistaken for a boy at 9 years old when she was playing soccer on a co-ed team. Later, she describes feeling uncomfortable with her film character wearing a skirt. If there is any cohesive narrative in her book, it is this attempt to explain her transition and to prove that she was always “transgender.” Given that she identified as a girl or woman throughout the vast majority of her life and was extremely feminine, her retroactive insertion of a transgender identity is less than believable. It instead seems that, once tired of the sexual liberation served up to her by Hollywood, she then, always credulous, turned to its next movement: transgenderism. Her fitting of transgenderism onto her life finds its manifestation mostly in claims that she wished to be rid of her female body throughout her life. All throughout this insertion of a transgender identity, whether it is in regard to growing up in Nova Scotia in the 1990s or coming out as a lesbian in 2014, she describes a person who very much has the personality of a girl or woman. And never does she talk about wanting to have conventionally masculine characteristics; instead, she shows a distaste for men, such as when she complains about having to work in “a cast full of cis men” while filming Inception . Later, she explains away acting as a woman for the entirety of her “marriage,” which lasted from 2018 until she came out as “transgender,” by calling it “an emotional disguise” and saying that she had “numbed” herself to the “truth.” When Page starts thinking about taking on a transgender identity, it seems to be an effort to erase her feminine identity rather than an effort to take on a masculine identity. When she begins filming The Umbrella Academy , for example, she informs the showrunners that she wants to wear a tight- fitting sports bra in all scenes. When acting in the show, she tries to tone down the femininity of the original comic book character. She also describes a feeling of alienation from her body. She calls her body a “flesh vessel” and describes it as having a personality apart from herself. Then, when she decides to “transition” after her “marriage” falls apart (but before divorce proceedings begin), she immediately begins a mad, desperate dash to cut off her breasts as quickly as possible. In fact, she describes contacting a surgeon for a double mastectomy as the first real step to adopting her transgender identity. Her surgery comes within months after her first consultation. She explains that her “flesh vessel” is “always smarter” than her and had known, even before her, that she is really a man. This is not a coherent ideology. This is deep confusion by a vulnerable woman. ***** Last weekend, the Daily Wire’s Michael Knowles published an interview with two liberal college students . One is a man who identifies as a transgender woman; the other is a woman who identifies as nonbinary. Both insisted to Knowles that transgender activists understand that biological sex exists and that people are either biologically male or biologically female. “We know that sex is unambiguous,” said the student who identifies as transgender. “I don’t think that we’re denying that.” To this, the student who identifies as nonbinary responded, “There’s this odd idea among conservatives that transgender people don’t understand that biological sex exists.” But for many transgender activists, such an explanation is deeply offensive. For example, a gender-affirming therapist that fellow Daily Wire host Matt Walsh spoke to in his film What Is a Woman? told him that she was “assigned female” at birth but that she is a “not a woman.” She explained: “We know now that sex and gender are so much more than just this binary. Some women have penises, right. Some men have vaginas.” As for Page, she falls into the latter camp that claims “a transgender man is a man.” She repeatedly says in her activism that people who deny that she is a man deny her “right to exist.” When these mantras are repeated alongside the theory of transgenderism, they can convince many. But when told alongside the reality of a person’s life, they start to fall apart. Nothing about Page projects masculinity or manhood — not even her scratchy, slightly deepened voice that is still clearly that of a woman. Instead, her transgender identity exists in self-hatred and self-alienation, especially in regard to her feminine traits and characteristics. It is a misogyny directed at herself. The ideological transgenderism Page subscribes to does not speak of a reason for why a particular person is “transgender”; it claims a person was simply born that way. But the reality of Page’s life story shows that there indeed was a long series of terrible events and mistakes that culminated in her rejecting the reality that she is a woman. Transgenderism was not inherent. She chose it."
"1","Very few independent minds ever truly believed that “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” — DEI, for short — was good for anyone other than its direct beneficiaries. But that hasn’t stopped corporate America from insisting that it is. “Diversity targets” and “inclusion goals” are now the cost of doing business in many Fortune 500 C-suites, spurred on by equity consultants who charge corporate giants by the hour for lectures on their subconscious bigotry — a bigotry that, conveniently enough, can only ever be overcome by forking over more cash for more lectures from the consultants in question. The formal argument for this system is that DEI is good for business — a claim that, in turn, relies on a handful of heavily-cited studies purporting to demonstrate a link between diversity and corporate profits. The most influential in this genre is a series from the consulting heavyweight McKinsey, which has produced four studies extolling the virtues of DEI over the course of the past decade: “Diversity Matters” (2015), “Delivering through Diversity” (2018), “Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters” (2020), and “Diversity Matters Even More: The Case for Holistic Impact” (2023). The core claim of these studies — that more DEI leads to better corporate performance — has served as the fertile ground for the blossoming of the entire DEI industry. The only problem is that it happens to not be true. A new paper published earlier this week in Econ Journal Watch — and unearthed by journalist Chris Brunet — tests McKinsey’s claims of “statistically significant positive relations between the industry- adjusted earnings … of global McKinsey-chosen sets of large public firms and the racial/ethnic diversity of their executives.” The paper’s authors, Jeremiah Green and John R.M. Hand, found the thesis wanting: “[U]sing data for firms in the publicly observable S&P; 500,” Green and Hand’s research showed no “statistically significant relations” between McKinsey’s “measures of executive racial/ethnic diversity” and “either industry-adjusted earnings before interest and taxes margin or industry-adjusted sales growth, gross margin, return on assets, return on equity, and total shareholder return.” This isn’t the first time that Green and Hand have published work calling McKinsey’s famous pro-DEI studies into question. A July 2021 Quartz piece, “ Is McKinsey wrong about the financial benefits of diversity? , ” reports on their earlier research on the issue: If you’ve read an article about the importance of diversity in the workplace in the past few years, chances are you’ve come across the assertion that more diverse companies turn out higher profits. Key to the popularization of this idea are three McKinsey studies , released in 2015, 2018, and 2020, which showed that companies with greater racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in their leadership tended to perform better financially…. A new paper [from Green and Hand], posted on the open- access research platform SSRN, offers one more reason to be cautious in making claims about the business case for diversity. The authors applied McKinsey’s approach to companies in the S&P; 500 index, and did not find a link between racial and ethnic diversity and financial performance. “McKinsey,” Quartz reported at the time, “declined to comment on the study’s findings.” There is very little reason to expect that the firm will respond to the more recent study’s findings either. The debunking of McKinsey’s research has gone largely unnoticed in most of America’s major institutions, which have continued to highlight and cite the “Diversity Matters” series as justification for their ever-expanding DEI programs and bureaucracies. An X thread from America 2100 chronicles the sheer number of powerful institutions that have uncritically embraced McKinsey’s claims — and, as a result, DEI — in recent years: the New York Times , Washington Post , Wall Street Journal , Harvard Business Review , U.S. Navy, Raytheon, Intel, J.P. Morgan, Ford, and Apple, to name just a few. A “classic,” the old joke goes, is “a book that everyone talks about but no one reads.” One might say something similar about the “empirical proof” of diversity’s innate virtues. The diversity dogma has become an unquestioned premise among America’s corporate elite; its truth is assumed as something akin to a first principle. In a CNBC interview last year, a member of Ford’s board of directors complained that “the biggest obstacle to diversity is lack of true buy-in — as I call it, ‘true believers.’” Those “believers,” she explained, “are the decision makers in companies who are truly convinced of the proven business case that diversity in their workforce … leads to more profitability.” Green and Hand’s numerous studies suggest that the “proven business case” for DEI might be less proven than McKinsey would have us believe. But in truth, we never really needed academic studies to tell us this. Basic common sense would have led to the same conclusion: “Diversity,” taken at face value, is neither a good nor a bad; it is merely a multitude of different things. Whether diversity is good, bad, or neutral depends upon the specific nature of the things in question and the context in which they appear. A shipwrecked crew stranded on a remote island might benefit from having a diversity of different skills — hunting, building, food preparation, and so on. A diversity of deadly injuries or exotic diseases would have quite the opposite effect. Of course, “multiculturalism” is the specific kind of diversity championed by DEI — not a diversity of ailments or illnesses, but of peoples and cultures. But that, too, is subject to the same basic question: Diversity of what people, and inclusion of which cultures? The question doesn’t appear to have even occurred to McKinsey and its counterparts. “Diversity,” McKinsey’s DEI primer declares, “brings multiple perspectives to the table during times when enhanced problem-solving skills and vision are needed.” More differences lead to more perspectives , and more perspectives lead to better business. In that case, corporate recruiters needn’t limit themselves to a few gender-nonconforming Harvard graduates. If it’s diverse perspectives they’re after, they should hire the Tanzanian witch doctors who kill albinos to concoct potions out of their body parts. They should hire the Afghans who have been practicing bacha bazi — literally, “boy play” — for over a millennia. They should hire the African warlords who pump their child soldiers full of tranquilizers, amphetamines, and cocaine mixed with gunpowder. They should hire the Amazon tribesmen that kill and eat farmers for religious rituals, the Sudanese and Egyptians who practice female genital mutilation, and every other culture and people and tradition in the world. Then, and only then, will they have an authentic diversity of lived experiences, befitting of a progressive, 21st-century workplace. But they won’t, of course, because that was never what this “diversity and inclusion” business was really about. For all the jargon-laden explainers, neither McKinsey nor their acolytes in corporate America really believe that diversity, in and of itself, is of any particular value at all. What they believe is that our institutions are too white, too straight, and too male, and that the only appropriate solution is to make them less so — even if they have to fudge a couple numbers here and there on the way."
"1","Arming-East-Asia-Deterring-China/dp/1682478513/ref=monarch_sidesheet""> Arming East Asia: Deterring China in the Early Cold War By Eric Setzekorn (Naval Institute Press, 348 pages, $30) The more you reflect on history, the better Dwight Eisenhower as a president looks. Liberal historians and political scientists, enthralled with Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy, portrayed Ike, who served in between those two Democrats, as a passive GOP president who relied on John Foster Dulles to conduct foreign policy and Sherman Adams to handle domestic policy. It was only in the late 1970s and early 1980s that scholars, most notably R. Gordon Hoxie (who worked with Eisenhower at Columbia University) and Fred Greenstein , began to reevaluate Eisenhower unencumbered by liberal ideology and partisan politics. Since then, even liberal scholars have mostly ranked Eisenhower in the top 10 of U.S. presidents. Now comes Eric Setzekorn, a historian at the Army’s Center for Military History, with a new and timely book about Eisenhower’s policy toward the Far East. In Arming East Asia: Deterring China in the Early Cold War , Setzekorn shows how Eisenhower transformed Truman’s bankrupt East Asian policy into a formidable politico- military deterrent of Communist China’s expansionist ambitions in the region, which the successor Kennedy and Johnson administrations squandered on the battlefields of Vietnam. Eisenhower’s strategy was a forerunner of the Nixon Doctrine of the late 1960s to early 1970s (Nixon was Eisenhower’s vice- president and likely learned from Eisenhower’s success). Ike provided military and economic assistance to key allies in the region — South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, South Vietnam, and Japan — to create what Setzekorn describes as “a robust, defensive force that greatly benefited American foreign policy in the region by serving as a credible deterrent without requiring large numbers of expensive and vulnerable U.S. combat troops.” It somehow mostly escapes historians and political scientists that Harry Truman’s successful European policies (the Marshall Plan, NATO) were more than offset by his disastrous Asian policies. And the greatest disaster in Asia — and the one we are still dealing with — was the “loss” of China to Mao Zedong’s communist forces. Setzekorn is unsparing in his criticism of what he calls the Truman administrations’ “willful neglect” of East Asia both in terms of politico- military assistance and bureaucratic structure. Setzekorn notes that after the failure of the Marshall mission to negotiate peace talks between the Nationalists and Communists, “Truman did not ask Congress for any aid to China.” Congress thought otherwise and voted to provide significant aid, but only a pittance of the proposed military aid reached the Nationalists before it was suspended near the end of 1948. Setzekorn characterizes this as the Truman administration’s “geostrategic disinterest in East Asia,” which Secretary of State Dean Acheson later tried to cover-up by issuing the infamous China White Paper that laid all of the blame for the loss of China on Chiang-Kai-shek and Nationalist corruption. Truman partisans and liberal historians ever since have decried the notion that Truman “lost China,” characterizing the phrase as part of gthe era’s “McCarthyism,” but, to paraphrase Truman himself, “the buck stopped” with him. And though Setzekorn fails to mention it, Sen. McCarthy was not wrong about communist influence in the FDR-Truman administrations. The Truman State Department, for example, was littered with East Asian advisers who sympathized with Mao’s supposed “agrarian reformers.” One only has to read The Amerasia Spy Case or James Burnham’s compelling article about the ties between the notorious Institute for Pacific Relations and certain Truman State Department employees in The Freeman to understand their impact on the loss of China. Setzekorn, however, sees the main fault of Truman’s East Asia policy in a “pattern … of organizational dysfunction and lack of coherent goals” that “hindered American national-security strategy and the development of military relationships with allies.” It was only the outbreak of the Korean War — which came after Truman administration spokesmen told the world that Korea was not a part of America’s defense perimeter in Asia — that significant military assistance flowed to parts of East Asia. Eisenhower came to the presidency with some knowledge of East Asia and the western Pacific, having served as an aid to Gen. Douglas MacArthur in the Philippines in the mid-1930s. And Eisenhower understood what it took to build an army. Equally important, writes Setzekorn, Eisenhower shifted “American national-security interests away from Europe to focus on Asia.” Ike appointed Adm. Arthur Radford, former commander of the Pacific Fleet, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Unlike Truman, he organized the National Security Council (NSC) to coordinate policy, bifurcating the NSC into planning and operations. He created what Setzekorn calls a “whole of government” approach to East Asian affairs, especially in terms of military assistance to key allies. The goal of Ike’s East Asia policy was to develop “the political, economic and military strength of non-Communist Asian countries,” and it didn’t matter to Eisenhower whether those countries were democracies or autocracies. Funding for our Asian allies rose considerably, while cuts were made to our allies in Europe. Significantly, a portion of the funding for East Asian allies funded military academies to train officers. Setzekorn devotes a chapter each to the Eisenhower administration’s mostly successful efforts to strengthen and professionalize the armed forces of South Korea, South Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, and Japan. And in all of these countries, except Japan, there was only what Setzekorn calls a “light footprint” of American boots on the ground. We supplied the equipment and training, but the regional allies supplied the troops on the ground. And in Eisenhower’s time, this local deterrent force was reinforced by our extended nuclear deterrent, which proved itself during the two Taiwan Strait crises in the 1950s. Regrettably, Setzekorn writes, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations “lost the strategic initiative and became bogged down in a proxy war on the Chinese periphery.” Eisenhower’s East Asia policy kept the peace at an acceptable cost and successfully deterred China’s rulers in Beijing. The Eisenhower Doctrine in East Asia followed a “strategy of developing allied military capability in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, South Vietnam, and South Korea,” and this effectively “created a defensive network to deter PRC aggression and protect American interests without endangering American lives.” Setzekorn believes that a similar policy approach today is our best chance of once again successfully deterring an equally ambitious but much better armed PRC."
"2","A federal court is picking an unusual fight with one of the federal judiciary’s governing bodies — one with implications for literally all aspects of US policy. In March, the Judicial Conference of the United States, one of the federal courts’ internal governing bodies, announced a new policy intended to combat “judge-shopping.” Some federal courts effectively allow plaintiffs to choose their own judges, which has allowed many litigants with dubious or even ridiculous claims to obtain court orders blocking pretty much any federal policy that they find objectionable. One court that allowed such judge- shopping, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, announced on Friday that it will defy the Judicial Conference and refuse to implement the new policy. This defiance, if allowed to stand, would render the Judicial Conference’s new policy virtually useless, as the Northern District of Texas is the locus of the nation’s worst problem with judge-shopping. Among other things, the fact that many right-wing plaintiffs can select Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to hear their lawsuits has turned this obscure Trump appointee to this Texas federal court into one of the most powerful public officials in the country . Kacsmaryk is a former lawyer at a Christian right law firm with a long record of hostility toward LGBTQ rights, abortion , and even many forms of heterosexual sexuality . He is the judge who attempted to ban the abortion medication mifepristone . And, in his brief period on the bench, he’s handed down a long line of orders implementing right-wing policies on birth control , immigration , and LGBTQ discrimination . He even backed a ban on theater performances he finds objectionable . Now-Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk during his confirmation hearing. Courtesy of the Senate Judiciary Committee The Northern District of Texas’s decision to defy the Judicial Conference sets up what could be a very significant conflict between this far- right court, and a broader federal judiciary that is controlled by more center-right judges — and it’s hardly the only such conflict brewing within the federal courts. In its current term, the Supreme Court heard an unusually long list of cases arising out of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the MAGA movement’s most loyal stronghold within the judiciary . These include the mifepristone case , a case where the Fifth Circuit held that many domestic abusers have a right to own guns , a decision allowing Republican lawmakers to seize control of what content is published online, and a decision about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that, if upheld, could trigger a second Great Depression . At least based on the oral arguments in those cases, however, it appears likely that an alliance between the Court’s three Democrats and its three least hardline Republicans will prevent the Fifth Circuit from reshaping the nation in MAGA’s image. Similarly, it’s significant that, when the Judicial Conference announced its new policy against judge-shopping, it chose Chief Judge Jeffery Sutton as its spokesperson on this issue. Sutton is a conservative George W. Bush appointee to the Sixth Circuit, and is an intellectual leader among more traditionalist Republican judges who believe in limited judicial power. By making Sutton the face of the new judge-shopping rules, the Judicial Conference seemed to signal that the federal courts’ non-MAGA Republicans shared many Democrats’ frustration with judges like Kacsmaryk. It remains to be seen how the broader judiciary — and the Supreme Court in particular — will react to the Northern District of Texas’s insistence that anyone who wants to sabotage a Biden administration policy should be allowed to select Matthew Kacsmaryk as their judge. And, no matter how the broader judiciary reacts in the short term, lawyers like Kacsmaryk could easily find themselves in charge of the entire court system if former President Donald Trump has the opportunity to appoint more of him to the federal bench. But, for the time being, there are significant signs that more traditionalist Republican judges are willing to ally with Democrats against the federal judiciary’s far right. The judiciary is designed to be more resistant to political trends than the two elected branches If you’re an elected Republican, publicly disagreeing with Donald Trump is a dangerous proposition. Some Republicans who cross Trump face literal death threats from MAGA voters , and even those who don’t are unlikely to prevail in their next primary election. As the Washington Post’s Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer described Trump’s approach to the 2022 midterms , “he made it a near-singular mission to defeat GOP lawmakers who voted for his impeachment and who publicly disputed his claims of election fraud.” The federal courts, by contrast, are designed to insulate judges from shifting political winds. Federal judges serve for life , and as a practical matter can only be removed against their will through impeachment. So they have no reason to take a stance that they personally disagree with out of fear that acting according to their own conscience will cost them their job. Of course, the fact that judges serve for life does not mean that they are immune to far- right ideas. Many federal judges, including Kacsmaryk, already embraced a reactionary worldview when they joined the bench. Others have flexible ideologies that match whatever views are ascendant within the Republican Party at any given moment. Still others hope for a promotion and seek to catch the next Republican president’s eye by deliberately handing down extreme opinions. (Democratic judges sometimes engage in similar behavior, although they often have to temper their views because a GOP-controlled Supreme Court can reverse them if they push too hard.) But the fact that judges have more freedom to break with their party than, say, members of Congress , means that the federal judiciary is currently a better reflection of the diversity of viewpoints within the GOP than, say, the US House of Representatives. Nearly every Republican member of the House is there because they survived a Republican primary, often after adjusting their public stances to ensure that they will not attract Trump’s ire. The judiciary, by contrast, includes holdovers appointed during the Reagan and Bush administrations, as well as some Trump appointees who reject at least some of MAGA’s goals. That explains why Trump- appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh has become one of the judiciary’s most vocal critics of Republican proposals to control who gets to speak online. It also explains why some of Trump’s attempts to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election were rejected by his own judicial appointees . Republican judges still act like Republicans, even if they are not MAGA stalwarts Of course, the fact that some Republican judges are more moderate than others does not mean that they are not Republicans. All six of the Supreme Court’s Republican appointees, for example, voted to end affirmative action at nearly all universities. All of them voted for a sweeping expansion of gun rights . All of them back novel legal doctrines which seek to dismantle much of the federal administrative state . All of the Republican justices except for Chief Justice John Roberts voted to overrule Roe v. Wade , and Roberts did not so much endorse Roe as suggest that his Court dismantle it more slowly. What all of these issues share in common, however, is that the Republican Party long ago reached a consensus on them . Abortion foes, gun groups, and opponents of affirmative action have long been powerful voices within the GOP. And, while most Americans probably have no opinion on how the administrative state should function, the Federalist Society — the powerful conservative lawyers’ group which functions as the de facto legal arm of the Republican Party — has been obsessed with weakening federal agencies since the Obama administration . There are plenty of issues, however, where the post- Trump Republican Party has broken with its pre-Trump consensus. And, on these issues, Republican judges are much more divided. Consider, for example, free speech. Before Trump took over the GOP, there was a broad bipartisan consensus that even the most repugnant speech is protected by the Constitution. Thus, in United States v. Stevens (2010), the Supreme Court struck down a poorly drafted federal law banning “crush” videos, fetish videos that often depict a woman crushing an animal to death (Congress reenacted the ban in a differently worded statute that is less vulnerable to a First Amendment lawsuit). And, in Snyder v. Phelps (2011), the Court sided with members of a notorious church who protested a fallen marine’s funeral with signs featuring anti-gay slurs and the message “Thank God for Dead Soldiers.” Both were 8-1 decisions, with only Justice Samuel Alito in dissent. Indeed, before Trump ran for office, Republican judges generally took an even more expansive view of free speech than their Democratic colleagues. That’s because Republicans typically saw the First Amendment as a vehicle to dismantle campaign finance laws , while Democrats believed that the public interest in preventing political corruption overcomes the free speech arguments against such laws. Much of the post-Trump GOP, by contrast, is eager to use the power of government to control political debates. The Republican legislatures of Texas and Florida, for example, both enacted laws seeking to seize control of content moderation at major social media outlets like Facebook , Twitter , and YouTube . When the Texas law reached the Supreme Court in 2022, however, it cleaved the Republican justices down the middle . Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett all voted to suspend the law, while Justices Clarence Thomas, Alito, and Neil Gorsuch voted to let it take effect. Similarly, when the Court heard oral arguments last February to decide whether to permanently block these laws, Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett all seemed to cling to the pre-Trump Republican position that the government should not regulate speech. Similarly, while all six of the Court’s Republicans voted in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022) to drastically expand gun rights, Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett all appeared to recoil from Bruen ’s implications once they realized it could arm domestic abusers who are subject to restraining orders . Kacsmaryk’s order attempting to ban mifepristone could have also forced the courts to remove thousands of medications from the market if it were upheld by higher courts — which may explain why only two justices, Thomas and Alito, dissented from the Court’s decision to block Kacsmaryk’s order last year . So, while the Court’s Republican appointees tend to see eye-to-eye on issues that unite Republicans, they also divide on the sort of issues where there is no GOP consensus. And that means there’s a meaningful divide between the judiciary’s center right and its far right. That said, this divide could stop mattering very quickly if Trump gets to fill additional seats on the Supreme Court. While lifetime appointments allow long-serving judges like Roberts or Sutton to drift away from their political parties, they do nothing to prevent a sitting president from appointing new judges who share that president’s views. And so, if Trump wins, he could potentially fill the bench with Kacsmaryks — destroying the relevance of holdover Republicans with more moderate views, and tipping the debate in favor of the far right for good.

"2","Joe Biden knows he has a problem with Latino voters . He acknowledged as much during a visit to Arizona last month: “I need you badly,” he said, with a tinge of exasperation, to a room of supporters. He was visiting a longtime Mexican restaurant, a staple in a working-class corner of downtown Phoenix, as his presidential campaign officially launched its general election effort to woo and win back Latino voters in Arizona and other battleground states. The effort, called “Latinos con Biden-Harris,” is starting off much earlier than the muted version that played out in 2020, long after a bruising and cash- strapped primary campaign had ended and as the coronavirus pandemic spun out of control. This year, it couldn’t be coming at a more necessary time. Across just about every kind of poll and survey, Biden (and his party) seems to be struggling to hold onto the high levels of support that the second-fastest growing ethnic voting group has historically given Democrats. More Hispanic and Latino voters say they are open to switching parties than before. They are dissatisfied with the state of the economy under Biden’s leadership. Many pine for the pre-pandemic Trump days. And more worrying for Democrats, they view Donald Trump more positively today than they did after the 2020 election . Still, none of that means that Republicans are actively taking advantage of this moment. For now, the Trump campaign and the GOP don’t seem to have a concrete strategy to make more inroads with these voters. As the Republican National Committee undergoes a major transition with more Trump-aligned leadership, its much-lauded community outreach centers to nonwhite voters stand in limbo. Those centers were celebrated by Republican politicians and strategists ahead of the 2022 midterms for hosting cultural events and establishing a direct presence for the party in minority communities. Many are now closed, though the RNC has backtracked on reported plans to close even more and shut down its minority outreach program. The recent rollout of the “Latinos con Biden-Harris” effort is a perfect example of these contrasting realities: During the last two weeks, the most the Republican Party, or the Trump campaign, has done in reaching out to Hispanic and Latino voters was to recirculate a fan-created musical jingle that it repackaged as an ad toward the end of the 2020 campaign cycle, and fire off a few social media posts. They made no ad buys, nor did Trump make any campaign stops or public statements directed specifically at these voters. But will this slow Republican outreach end up mattering? The last two weeks show, in a nutshell, the dueling struggles of Democratic and Republican outreach to Latino voters in 2024. Despite having some momentum on their side, the Republican Party seems unable, or unwilling, to seize the opportunity they have in swing states to lock up support from America’s newest swing voters. Meanwhile, spooked Democrats, on the defensive, are ready to pour in huge amounts of money and dedicate resources early on — but they may be focusing on a message that just doesn’t resonate with the voters most upset with the Biden years. The Biden- Harris launch in Arizona is a stand-in for their Southwestern and Latino strategy The launch of the Latinos con Biden-Harris effort was intentional and symbolic. The restaurant Biden visited, El Portal, was opened and is owned by two longtime fixtures in Arizona Hispanic politics, and it has served as the “ de facto headquarters ” of Phoenix’s Latino and Hispanic Democrats for years. That movement, starting as grassroots pro-immigrant activism through small businesses, has been building gradually over the last two decades. It bore fruit during the Trump era, when moderates, progressives, white, Black, and Latino voters turned out for Democrats.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images Arizona is now the quintessential battleground state, and at its core is Maricopa County — the county that has seen some of the biggest gains in population through Phoenix and its expanding, wealthier suburbs. A combination of a rapidly growing young Latino electorate, the Republican Party’s shift to the MAGA right, and more independent- and moderate-minded suburban voters concentrated in Maricopa has made the conservative bastion competitive for Democrats. Since the Trump era of national politics began, Arizona has elected two Democratic senators, a Democratic governor and attorney general, and voted for Biden — after not voting for a Democratic presidential candidate for 20 years. That history and those trends contextualize the Biden-Harris campaign’s decision to launch their Latino outreach effort in Phoenix before stopping in Nevada, another Latino-heavy swing state, and then making a fundraising visit to Houston, all within the span of a week . “In both states, we’re building robust campaign infrastructure to meet voters where they are,” the Biden- Harris campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said in a memo distributed before the campaign stops. “Both Nevada and Arizona represent the diverse coalition of voters who elected Joe Biden president in 2020, including Latino, Black, [Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander], and Native American voters.” That week of March 18 saw Biden and his campaign’s Latino surrogates spread across local and national television and radio programs, in English- and Spanish-language markets, to pair with the president’s in-person visits. The campaign timed the release of its first Latino-focused digital ad with this launch, and the ad ran in English, Spanish, and Spanglish with voiceovers using different regional accents depending on the battleground. Later that week, on March 23, the campaign pushed out a second digital ad in Spanish and English in Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Florida. Both video shorts are part of a $30 million advertising push this spring that is specifically directed at reaching voters in battleground states, including nonwhite voters. “This is not parachuting into any community two weeks before the election,” California Sen. Alex Padilla, campaign advisory board member, said in a statement about the release. “We’re starting months and months and months even before the Democratic convention this summer, to get the message out.” The message in Biden’s visit, his surrogates’ statements, and the ads targeting Latino voters is both an evolution and a retreading of old ground. It plays up the well-worn anti-Republican attacks that have worked for them before: Republicans’ opposition to abortion rights and reproductive freedom, their plans to cut entitlement spending, and Trump’s track record of anti-immigrant or bigoted statements. What’s new is the focus on Biden’s accomplishments: lowering the cost of some prescription drugs, attempting to “ease” student debt, supporting Latino-owned small businesses and Hispanic-serving colleges and universities, and lowering Hispanic unemployment. Still, that doesn’t mean the message is resonating just yet. Latino views of Biden’s handling of the economy and job performance, as well as overall approval, are still negative, or on par with the views of white voters. While this initial outreach is playing up elements of social issues that have helped Democrats with other voting groups, the state of the economy and the perception of an out-of-control border and immigration crisis continue to be weak spots for Democrats. And Biden and his allies have yet to develop a coordinated message in response. Biden talked briefly about his vision of economic opportunity in his Phoenix stop, for example, but none of the Latino-focused ads released so far play up those accomplishments. And none of the campaign’s Latino-specific messaging appears to address immigration at the southern border beyond playing up Trump’s previous talk of “an invasion” that is “poisoning the blood of our country.” So to be a Latino — and most likely a Mexican American — voter in Arizona or the Southwest right now is to feel an early sampling of the saturation the Democrats plan for this year. You’re likely hearing more about a choice between two candidates instead of a referendum on the incumbent, hearing about the threat Trump and Republicans pose to the status quo, and hearing about how the economy is getting better, even if you don’t fully agree. You’re hearing little to nothing about immigration or the southern border from Democrats beyond identity politics. Still, at least you’re hearing from Democrats, whether at the local, state, or national level, who are making early entreaties to you and your community specifically. The same is not true on the Republican side. Republicans seem unwilling to make the same kind of early investment The GOP has a golden opportunity, and many Republicans recognize this: They have a window to win over even more Latino voters than in 2020, and nearly all polling shows they have reason to be optimistic. Still, a Latino exodus from the Democratic Party is unlikely to happen without active and intentional efforts to win over voters. At least for now, either because of a lack of money, strategy, or will, the Republican Party is doing the bare minimum. Trump’s supporters attend his caucus-night watch party at the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino on February 8 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mario Tama/Getty Images Between 2020 and the 2022 midterms, the best piece of evidence Republicans could use to show that they were serious about winning over more Latino (and other nonwhite) voters was the opening and expansion of community outreach centers in predominantly minority neighborhoods in battleground states. Launched when hype over Latinos “fleeing” the Democratic Party was building, these community centers were framed by Republican leadership as “part of our party’s commitment to building relationships with the Hispanic community,” according to then-RNC chair Ronna McDaniel. “Democrats take Hispanic voters for granted, and we want to earn your vote and build a better future for our children,” she said when the RNC, in conjunction with a US senate campaign, opened an outreach center in Maricopa County — a center meant to be a part of a “permanent, data-driven ground game in Arizona” and a “place to come together, host events and spark conversations with Hispanic Arizonans.” Less than two years later, that center was shuttered, along with the vast majority of the 20 Hispanic community centers the RNC had opened ahead of the 2022 midterms. Five remain open today, including two that The Messenger had reported were opened in 2023. And these closures seem to be part of a broader retreat by the Republican Party: other centers aimed at reaching Black, Asian, and Native American voters have also been reportedly shut down and their outreach programs ended as new, Trump-aligned leadership purged and laid off staff , including communications staff and those who worked on minority outreach. The RNC contests those closures, saying it is keeping a number of centers open for its early voting education program and says it intends to open more. After the Phoenix center closed, for example, some news reports suggested that the RNC would instead open a new branch in Tucson, another urban area in Arizona with a large Hispanic population and a bedrock of support for Democrats in the state. But the Arizona Republican Party did not reply to requests for comment or clarification on the status of that center, or other centers in the state. Nor did the Trump campaign reply to Vox’s requests for comment on its plans or strategy for Latino voter outreach, instead referring me to the RNC, which provided the following statement attributed to its Hispanic communications director, Jaime Florez. “Democrats have taken the Hispanic community for granted for far too long, and no amount of money the Biden campaign spends will change the fact that Biden and Harris have been a disaster for our community,” Florez said in the statement. ”Republicans will continue receiving with open arms thousands of Hispanics that are moving to our party, disappointed with Democrats and their policies, and will be fundamental to Republican victories all over the country in 2024.” This intra-party turmoil and a stretched budget for outreach and campaign infrastructure seem to be at the heart of the Trump-era GOP’s ability to compete for nonwhite voters’ support. The tenuous state of Latino outreach in Arizona, for example, is replicated in Nevada and Wisconsin , two other states where Republicans had talked up their efforts to win over Latino voters. So far, the extent of the GOP’s Latino outreach while the Democrats rolled out a highly coordinated effort was a recirculated social media clip of a “Latinos por Donald Trump” ad from 2020 and a few tweets about illegal immigration and the border. Trump did boast about his polling among Latino voters during a February visit to Las Vegas, but he still has yet to visit Arizona. It’s a limited approach, but even at this level of outreach, the abbreviated messages Trump and Republicans are sending may still be compelling. That 2020 ad, for example, was successful when it ran four years ago because it was organically produced — a short jingle written by a Cuban salsa band made up of Trump fans — and because it summarized the key planks of Trump’s 2020 pitch to Latino voters: “la buena vida” (the good life), “la economia” ( the economy), and “tu familia” (your family). Coupled with clips and tweets hyping up an “ invasion ” at the southern border, and Republicans have the barebones of another persuasive pitch. That’s the extent of the messaging Latino voters in swing states like Arizona are getting from Republicans right now. No Hispanic-specific Trump ads are running on television or radio in Arizona, either in English or Spanish. Trump did not hold any campaign events during the week the Biden-Harris operation rolled through the Southwest, let alone anything directed at these voters. And the former president has held only two campaign rallies since Super Tuesday in Georgia and Ohio, aimed at boosting his preferred candidates in primary races. Still, the lack of early investment by the party and campaign might not be as big of a deal, since the work to target and fine-tune a pitch to these voters might be better suited to external organizations and super PACS, the Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini told me. “The vast majority of that [Latino shift to the right] is being driven by the environment politically. Right now, both dissatisfaction with Biden and Trump being more of an anti- elitist candidate who has a more natural appeal to working class voters, that is what we’re seeing reflected in the polls right now,” he said. “When it comes to the organization to actually bring that vote out in November, you’re going to see a pretty big ecosystem pop up. We’re no longer in the era of the RNC [doing] everything or the campaign [doing] everything. You have so much outside the formal party apparatus, and I do think you’ll see more efforts on that side to capitalize on those shifts because that’s where the resources are.” Democrats can’t afford to fall behind, while Republicans seem to be riding on coattails This early Democratic start with Hispanic and Latino voters contrasts with the sluggish Republican operation — but it also shows just how much Democrats have to fear and have to lose with these voters. Democrats have no choice but to start big and early because of how far they’ve fallen behind their historical levels of Latino support. The last three presidential cycles have each delivered Democrats consistently smaller margins of support with all kinds of nonwhite voters, but especially with Latinos: During Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign, for example, the Democratic advantage over Republicans with these voters was a 39-point difference in vote preference; by 2020, that advantage had shrunk by 16 points . As Hispanic and Latino Americans become swing voters , the stakes of outreach and persuasion could not be higher for the party that has enjoyed their support for so long.

"2","Saving is hard. Whether for emergencies, special occasions, or retirement, a lot of us fall short. In fact, almost half of Americans don’t have three months worth of expenses saved . And for some, it’s partly because they aren’t allowed to. Imagine you have to stop working for whatever reason, but legally you’ve only been allowed to build up $2,000 in savings. Could you make it through one month — let alone more? First, you have rent. Let’s say it runs you $1,109 (that’s an average monthly rent for Michigan , one of the cheaper states in the US). That leaves you with $891. After utilities and internet and groceries and any other bills, there’s not much left for day-to-day life or unexpected emergencies. And rent the next month would be impossible. But this isn’t a pretend “let’s learn personal finance ” moment. This is a real financial barrier that millions of Americans have to live with. Americans like Tyler Lima-Roope, a popular TikToker from California who raises awareness about living with a disability and who receives Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. SSI is a program that supports low-income adults and children with disabilities. So why does a program that’s supposed to help Americans who have nowhere else to turn, instead … trap them in poverty ? How SSI traps people in poverty, explained To get an answer to that question on a recent episode of The Weeds , I reached out to Kathleen Romig, the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. According to her, when the program was founded in 1972, it was — and still is — considered a last resort: You receive it after applying for all the other social safety nets you qualify for. Qualifying requires specific medical and vocational criteria, meaning that in order to receive the benefit, you not only need to be living with a disability, but the disability must also prevent you from earning $1,500 a month. SSI is about more than just a stipend, though; health care access comes along with it. In some states, receiving SSI means you’re automatically eligible for Medicaid, and Medicaid covers what’s known as “home and community-based services.” That means people with disabilities can receive care in their homes rather than in institutional settings. vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Subscribe But in order to qualify for SSI, individual beneficiaries can’t have assets worth over $2,000 and couples can’t have assets over $3,000. And that’s not just checking accounts: it takes things like mutual funds, retirement, and even car values into account. If you go over that limit, you lose that month’s check. The asset cap hasn’t been updated since the 1980s — and not for any particular reason. When it was created, it wasn’t enacted to be automatically adjusted for inflation; if it had been, the SSI cap would be about six times what it is right now. SSI has fallen by the policy wayside, leaving the 7.5 million Americans who rely on the program between a rock and hard place: lose health care and other benefits, or forgo opportunities like saving for the future and getting married. Is there any way out? Given that not much has changed for SSI in the past 40 years, the obvious answer is raising the asset cap. But that can’t happen short of an act of Congress . The good news? There’s bipartisan legislation proposed in the House and Senate that would raise the limit to $10,000 per individual and $20,000 per couple. This would allow individuals to save more and also rids the program of its marriage penalty. The less than good news? Neither bill has yet come up for a floor vote. And in our current era of hyperpolarization, Congress is moving especially slow, even on legislation that keeps the country running, let alone updating outdated caps for social safety net programs. Romig says the lack of change regarding SSI isn’t really a political issue — she has yet to come across anyone on either side of the aisle who thinks raising the asset limit is a bad idea. It’s an attention issue; many people who don’t interact with SSI on a day-to-day basis aren’t aware of the low asset cap. The better news is that there is a possible workaround: ABLE accounts. These are state-run tax-advantaged accounts, similar to 529 accounts that parents use to save for a child’s education. ABLE account limits can be as high as $550,000, depending on the state, and don’t count toward the asset limit. At its inception, it was for people who had a disability before the age of 26, but a new provision in the 2020 appropriations bill raised the qualification age by 20 years, starting in 2026 . But once again, there’s a gap in awareness: less than 1 percent of people who qualify for ABLE accounts have one. Here’s hoping this story — and my full conversation with Romig on the latest episode of The Weeds — are one tiny step toward changing that.

"2","Last month, Medicare announced that it will cover the new class of anti- obesity drugs, including Wegovy and Ozempic, for patients at risk of stroke or heart attack. It’s a watershed moment for a novel class of medications, one sure to amplify debates about their long-term value — and whether their high price tags are worth it. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, responsible for 1 in every 5 deaths. As of 2017, 42 percent of Medicare enrollees 65 and older had at least one heart condition — meaning that the federal government’s decision will likely dramatically increase the number of Medicare enrollees who are prescribed these drugs. One analyst recently predicted “millions” of new prescriptions if heart-related indications were covered. Medicare spending on semaglutide-based drugs — the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic — already stood at $5.7 billion in 2022 and is poised to grow exponentially. (That number is before accounting for federally mandated rebates that reduce the actual costs; real spending numbers are lower, but they’re notoriously difficult to pin down.) But the drugs are extraordinarily expensive, with Wegovy’s list price around $16,200 for a one-year supply. Some experts say we don’t know enough about the long- term benefits to justify paying that cost on taxpayers’ dime. Why it’s so hard to figure out if Wegovy and Ozempic are really worth it Historically, government health insurance plans like Medicare and Medicaid have covered any FDA-approved drugs that treat a condition covered under the program’s benefits — in this case, heart disease. But in recent years, as novel treatments for various health conditions have been debuting with astronomical list prices, policymakers have begun restricting coverage. A decade ago, for example, some state Medicaid programs struggled to afford a new generation of hepatitis C cures. In 2021, when the FDA approved a new Alzheimer’s drug with limited clinical evidence, Medicare sought to restrict coverage to constrain its spending on an unproven treatment. In 2022, Congress gave Medicare the authority to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies for the first time, giving the program more sway to align its payments for prescription drugs with the actual value those drugs provide. But Wegovy and Ozempic present a particularly difficult case. Obesity is a national health crisis, one affecting tens of millions of Americans, and weight-loss drugs have never been covered by Medicare. But there is growing data that these drugs also reduce heart disease risk — one clinical trial involving more than 17,000 patients found Wegovy significantly reduced the chances of an adverse cardiovascular event such as heart attack or stroke. Just 6.5 percent of participants who received Wegovy experienced an acute cardiac emergency, compared to 8 percent of patients who took a placebo. Still, a recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office projected that if semaglutide-based medications become more widely available, they “would cost the federal government more than it would save from reducing other health care spending — which would lead to an overall increase in the deficit over the next 10 years.” But beyond that window, it was unclear what budgetary effect they’ll have. There is too much uncertainty about the drugs’ long-term ability to improve people’s health and avert other health care spending on diseases linked with obesity. That is the usual ruthless cost-benefit analysis used by policymakers: Does the drug save the government money or not? There’s little room in government balance books for, say, a person’s improved self-esteem or increased ability to enjoy physical activity after losing weight. “Prevention efforts are often sold as saving money, given the potential to reduce health problems and costs in the future. The potential for net savings from prevention can be compelling, but it’s not always backed up by evidence for many interventions,” said Larry Levitt , executive vice president at the health policy think tank KFF. “But we don’t focus enough on the potential to improve people’s lives through prevention, which is an important goal in its own right, beyond the dollars and cents.” Ozempic and similar drugs are still in early stages, and a lot will change in the coming years. New iterations of the drugs are in the pipeline. The prices could change, too. In a decade or so, under current patent law, generics manufacturers will be able to produce cheap versions of semaglutide, which should lead to price reductions. Experts expect Medicare to try to negotiate prices with the manufacturers of Wegovy and Ozempic, given the projected increase in prescriptions after the recent coverage decision. But while anti-obesity drugs have been welcomed as a breakthrough for one of the country’s biggest and most persistent public health crises, plenty of questions remain about their long-term effectiveness. The medications are extraordinarily powerful at controlling patients’ appetite and therefore aiding weight loss; in clinical trials , patients lost an average of 15 percent of their body weight in little over a year. But that’s only as long as patients continue to take them — once a patient stops the drug, the benefits go away. And medication adherence is a struggle across the US health system . And even if people do adhere to regular doses, taking Wegovy or Ozempic long-term may prove prohibitively expensive. Even Medicare enrollees can pay up to $2,000 out of pocket annually for their prescription drugs, depending on their specific plan. The available evidence suggests patients will gain back some or all of the weight they had lost if they stop taking semaglutide. The whiplash of losing and then regaining weight may even be worse for a person’s health than if they had never lost the weight in the first place, Stacie Dusetzina , a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, told me. Doctors call it “weight cycling.” “That actually is pretty concerning,” Dusetzina said. Given the evidence that people struggle to maintain weight loss over time, some experts have called for putting less emphasis on losing weight for people who are obese or overweight and more on improving their access to medical care. How much should we pay to add a year of life? The quality-adjusted life year (QALY) , the most common metric that policymakers use to project the value of a treatment over time, aims to account for both the length of time that a drug might extend a person’s life and the quality of life that the person will enjoy during that extra time. Analysts can then tabulate how much money would need to be spent on a treatment in order to give a patient an additional year of high-quality living. But it’s not a very precise instrument; QALY has long been criticized as oversimplified, failing to account for the nuanced considerations that an individual patient might have about their own health. That lack of precision is evident in recent attempts to evaluate semaglutide’s long-term value. Wegovy manufacturer Novo Nordisk recently estimated that prescribing semaglutide to add one QALY to a patient’s life would cost anywhere between $23,500 and $144,000. The reason for such a wide range is the broad spectrum of alternative treatments for the same condition. Compared to receiving no other treatment, semaglutide added one QALY at a cost of $27,000. That’s a good deal — policymakers typically value one QALY at between $100,000 and $150,000. But when you start comparing Wegovy to other treatments on the market, including older and cheaper anti-obesity medications, the cost to add a QALY is much higher. Other projections have even less rosy expectations about the drug’s value, suggesting that it’s significantly overpriced. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an independent think tank known for its cost-benefit analyses, concluded that Wegovy would be worth an annual price between $7,500 and $9,800 per patient — substantially less than the current list price — for the health benefits it yields. We are at the start of a real-world experiment. It’ll take years of studying uptake, adherence, and clinical outcomes to get a better idea of how much value Wegovy, Ozempic, and their successors actually provide.

"2","The largest earthquakes in nearly 25 years rocked Taiwan on Wednesday morning, killing at least nine people and injuring hundreds more. The magnitude 7.4 quake led to a series of aftershocks, the largest of which reached magnitude 6.4 . Residents posted stunning scenes of swaying buildings and rocking bridges on social media as the earthquakes rocked their morning routines. Taiwan was struck by its strongest earthquake in 25 years on Wednesday. Scenes of water cascading down the side of buildings and debris falling onto the streets below were captured. ⁣ pic.twitter.com/my5Rkn16uB — AccuWeather (@accuweather) April 3, 2024 Taiwan has a long history of tremors and has invested a great deal in building codes to ensure structures can withstand shaking and early warning systems to alert residents via cellphones to seek shelter. That’s part of why despite Taiwan’s dense, urban population, there were relatively few casualties. But that wasn’t always the case — a magnitude 7.6 earthquake shook the island in 1999, killing close to 2,400 people. Around the world, quakes remain a potent, deadly threat. A series of earthquakes reaching magnitude 6.3 struck Afghanistan last year, leading to more than 2,400 deaths . A magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked Morocco last September, the largest earthquake to hit the country in at least 120 years. Officials reported that it killed more than 2,900 people . The Mediterranean region is also seismically active, according to the US Geological Survey , though such strong earthquakes are rare in North Africa. Quakes are more common in places like Turkey, where two major fault lines cross and trigger shocks on a regular basis. A huge magnitude 7.8 earthquake rattled across Turkey and Syria in 2023 and another quake with a magnitude of 7.5 rocked the region a few hours later. The quakes killed more than 50,000 people and toppled more than 5,600 buildings in the region . While scientists have drastically improved their understanding of where earthquakes are likely to occur, forecasting when one will occur is still impractical. The rumbling earth can easily catch people off-guard, worsening the ensuing death and destruction. In light of the recent disasters, here’s a refresher on earthquakes, along with some of the latest science on measuring and predicting them. 1) What causes earthquakes An earthquake occurs when massive blocks of the earth’s crust suddenly move past each other . These blocks, called tectonic plates, lie on top of the earth’s mantle, a layer that behaves like a very slow-moving liquid over millions of years. That means tectonic plates jostle each other over time. They can also slide on top of each other, a phenomenon called subduction. The places on the planet where one plate meets another are the most prone to earthquakes. The specific surfaces where parcels of earth slip past each other are called faults. As plates move, pressure builds up across their boundaries, while friction holds them in place. When the former overwhelms the latter, the earth shakes as the pent-up energy dissipates. Scientists understand these kinds of earthquakes well, which include those stemming from the San Andreas Fault in California and the East Anatolian Fault in Turkey. However, earthquakes can also occur within tectonic plates, as pressure along their edges cause deformations in the middle. These risks are harder to detect and measure. “Our understanding of these within-plate earthquakes is not as good,” said Stanford University geophysics professor Greg Beroza. An earthquake within a tectonic plate has fewer telltale signs than those that occur at fault lines, he added. 2) The Richter scale isn’t the only measurement game in town anymore The Richter scale, developed by Charles Richter in 1935 to measure quakes in Southern California, has fallen out of fashion. It uses a logarithmic scale, rather than a linear scale, to account for the fact that there is such a huge difference between the tiniest tremors and tower-toppling temblors. On a logarithmic scale, a magnitude 7 earthquake is 10 times more intense than a magnitude 6 and 100 times more intense than a magnitude 5. The Richter scale is actually measuring the peak amplitude of seismic waves, making it an indirect estimate of the earthquake itself. So if an earthquake is like a rock dropped in a pond, the Richter scale is measuring the height of the largest wave, not the size of the rock nor the extent of the ripples. And in the case of an earthquake, the ripples aren’t traveling through a homogenous medium like water, but through solid rock that comes in different shapes, sizes, densities, and arrangements. Solid rock also supports multiple kinds of waves. (Some geologic structures can dampen big earthquakes while others can amplify lesser tremors.) While Richter’s scale, calibrated to Southern California, was useful to compare earthquakes at the time, it provides an incomplete picture of risks and loses accuracy for stronger events. It also misses some of the nuances of other earthquake-prone regions in the world, and it isn’t all that useful for people trying to build structures to withstand them. “We can’t use that in our design calculations,” said Steven McCabe, leader of the earthquake engineering group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. “We deal in displacements.” Displacement, or how much the ground actually moves, is one alternative way to describe earthquakes. Another is the moment magnitude scale. It accounts for multiple types of seismic waves, drawing on more precise instruments and better computing to provide a reliable measuring stick to compare seismic events. When you hear about an earthquake’s magnitude in the news — like Turkey’s recent magnitude 7.8 quake — moment magnitude is usually the scale being used. But this is still a proxy for the size of the earthquake. And with only indirect measurements, it can take up to a year to decipher the scale of an event, like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, said Marine Denolle, an earthquake researcher at Harvard University. “We prefer to use peak ground acceleration,” she said. This is a metric that measures how the speed and direction of the ground changes and has proven the most useful for engineers. So, yes, earthquake scales have gotten a lot more complicated and specific over time. But that’s also helped scientists and engineers take much more precise measurements — which makes a big difference in planning for them. 3) We can’t really anticipate them all that well Predicting earthquakes is a touchy issue for scientists, in part because it has long been a game of con artists and pseudoscientists who claim to be able to forecast earthquakes. (Their declarations have, of course, withered under scrutiny .) Scientists do have a good sense of where earthquakes could happen. Using historical records and geologic measurements, they can highlight potential seismic hot spots and the kinds of tremors they face. (You can check out the US Geological Survey’s interactive map of fault lines and NOAA’s interactive map of seismic events.) As for when quakes will hit, that’s still murky. “Lots of seismologists have worked on that problem for many decades. We’re not predicting earthquakes in the short term,” said Beroza. “That requires us to know all kinds of information we don’t have.” It’s difficult to figure out when an earthquake will occur, since the forces that cause them happen slowly over a vast area but are dispersed rapidly over a narrow region. What’s amazing is that forces built up across continents over millions of years can hammer cities in minutes. Forecasting earthquakes would require high-resolution measurements deep underground over the course of decades, if not longer, coupled with sophisticated simulations. And even then, it’s unlikely to yield an hour’s worth of lead time. So there are ultimately too many variables at play and too few tools to analyze them in a meaningful way. Some research shows that foreshocks can precede a larger earthquake, but it’s difficult to distinguish them from the hundreds of smaller earthquakes that occur on a regular basis. On shorter time scales, texts and tweets can actually race ahead of seismic waves. In the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, for example, warnings from near the epicenter reached Tokyo 232 miles away, buying residents about a minute of warning time. Many countries are now setting up warning systems to harness modern electronic communications to detect tremors and transmit alerts ahead of shaking ground, buying a few precious minutes to seek shelter. Meanwhile, after a large earthquake, aftershocks often rock the afflicted region. “If we just had a big one, we know there will be smaller ones soon,” Denolle said. When it comes to prediction, researchers understandably want to make sure they don’t overpromise and underdeliver, especially when thousands of lives and billions of dollars in damages are at stake. But even this caution has had consequences. In 2012, six Italian scientists were sentenced to six years in prison for accurately saying the risks of a large earthquake in the town of L’Aquila were low after a small cluster of earthquakes struck the region in 2009. Six days after the scientists convened to assess the risk, a large quake struck and killed 309 people. Those convictions were later overturned and the ordeal has become a case study for how scientists convey uncertainty and risk to the public. 4) Sorry, your pets can’t predict earthquakes either Reports of animals acting strange ahead of earthquakes date back to ancient Greece. But a useful pattern remains elusive. Feathered and furry forecasters emerge every time there’s an earthquake and there’s a cute animal to photograph, but this phenomenon is largely confirmation bias . Animals do weird things (by our standards) all the time and we don’t attach any significance to them until an earthquake happens. “On any given day, there will be hundreds of pets doing things they’ve never done before and have never done afterward,” Beroza said. Bottom line: Don’t wait for weird animal behavior to signal that an earthquake is coming. 5) Some earthquakes are definitely human-made The gargantuan expansion of hydraulic fracturing across the United States has left an earthquake epidemic in its wake. It’s not the actual fracturing of shale rock that leads to tremors, but the injection of millions of gallons of wastewater underground. Scientists say the injected water makes it easier for rocks to slide past each other. “When you inject fluid, you lubricate faults,” Denolle said. US Geological Survey map of natural and induced earthquake risk in 2017. USGS The US Geological Survey calls these “induced earthquakes” and reported that in Oklahoma, the number of earthquakes surged to 2,500 in 2014, 4,000 in 2015, and 2,500 in 2016. “The decline in 2016 may be due in part to injection restrictions implemented by the state officials,” the USGS wrote in a release . “Of the earthquakes last year, 21 were greater than magnitude 4.0 and three were greater than magnitude 5.0.” This is up from an average of two earthquakes per year of magnitude 2.7 or greater between 1980 and 2000. (“Natural” earthquakes, on the other hand, are not becoming more frequent, according to Beroza.) Humans are causing earthquakes another way, too: Rapidly drawing water from underground reservoirs has also been shown to cause quakes in cities like Jakarta, Denolle said. 6) Climate change could have a tiny effect on earthquakes In general, scientists haven’t measured any effect on earthquakes from climate change . But they’re not ruling out the possibility. As average temperatures rise, massive ice sheets are melting, shifting billions of tons of water from exposed land into the ocean and allowing land masses to rebound. That global rebalancing could have seismic consequences , but signals haven’t emerged yet. “What might occur is enough ice melts that could unload the crust,” Beroza said, but added there is no evidence for this, nor for which parts of the world will reveal a signal. Denolle agreed that this could be a mechanism, but if there is any impact from climate change on earthquakes, she says she suspects it will be very small. 7) We’ve gotten better at reducing earthquake risks and saving lives About 90 percent of the world’s earthquakes occur in the Ring of Fire, the region around the Pacific Ocean running through places like the Philippines, Japan, Alaska, California, Mexico, and Chile. The ring is also home to three-quarters of all active volcanoes. Most of the planet’s earthquakes occur along the Pacific rim in a region known as the Ring of Fire. Javier Zarracina/Vox Mexico is an especially interesting case study. The country sits on top of three tectonic plates, making it seismically active. In 1985, an earthquake struck the capital, killing more than 10,000 . Denolle noted that the geology of the region makes it so that tremors from nearby areas are channeled toward Mexico City, making any seismic activity a threat. The Mexican capital is built on the site of the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, an island in the middle of a lake. The dry lakebed that is now the foundation of the modern metropolis amplifies shaking from earthquakes. The 1985 earthquake originated closer to the surface, and the seismic waves it produced had a relatively long time between peaks and valleys. This low-frequency vibration sends skyscrapers swaying, according to Denolle. “The recent earthquakes were deeper, so they had a higher frequency,” she said. The biggest factor in preventing deaths from earthquakes is building codes. Designing buildings to move with the earth while remaining standing can save thousands of lives, but putting them into practice can be expensive and frequently becomes a political issue. “Ultimately, that information has got to get implemented, and you can pretty much get that implemented in new construction,” McCabe said. “The trickier problem is existing buildings and older stock.” Earthquake-prone countries know this well: Japan has been aggressive about updating its building codes regularly to withstand earthquakes. The revised standards have in part fueled Japan’s construction boom despite its declining population. Mexico has also raised standards for new construction. Laws enacted after the 1985 earthquake required builders to account for the soft lakebed soil in the capital and tolerate some degree of movement. Meanwhile, Iran has gone through several versions of its national building standards for earthquake resilience. And Alaska has been developing earthquake damage mitigation strategies and response plans for years. But codes are not always enforced , and the new rules only apply to new buildings. A school that collapsed in a 2017 Mexico City earthquake apparently was an older building that was not earthquake-resistant. And because the more recent earthquakes in Mexico shook the ground in a different way, even some of the buildings that survived the 1985 earthquake collapsed after tremors in 2017. In countries like Iran, there is a wide gulf between how buildings are constructed in cities versus the countryside. More than a quarter of the country’s population lives in rural areas , where homes are built using traditional materials like mud bricks and stone rather than reinforced concrete and steel. This is a big part of why casualties are so high when earthquakes strike remote parts of the country. The biggest risks fall to countries that don’t have a major earthquake in living memory and therefore haven’t prepared for them, or don’t have the resources to do so. A lack of a unified building code led to many of the more than 150,000 deaths in Haiti stemming from the 2010 magnitude 7.0 earthquake. 8) The big one really is coming to the United States (someday) The really big one you keep hearing about is real. The New Yorker won a Pulitzer Prize in 2015 for its reporting on the potential for a massive earthquake that would rock the Pacific Northwest — “the worst natural disaster in the history of North America,” which would impact 7 million people and span a region covering 140,000 square miles. The potential quake could reach a magnitude between 8.7 and 9.2, bigger than the largest expected earthquake from the San Andreas Fault, which scientists expect to top out at magnitude 8.2. Large earthquakes are also in store for Japan, New Zealand, and other parts of the Ring of Fire. We don’t know when these earthquakes will rock us; we just have a rough estimate of the average time between them, which changes from region to region. “In the business, we’ve been talking about that [Pacific Northwest] scenario for decades,” Beroza said. “I wouldn’t say we’re overdue, but it could happen at any time.” “It is a threat,” echoed Denolle. “We forget about this threat because we have not had an earthquake there for a while.” “A while” means more than 300 years. So while California has long been steeling itself for big earthquakes with building codes and disaster planning, the Pacific Northwest may be caught off guard, though the author of the New Yorker piece, Kathryn Schulz, helpfully provided a guide to prepare .

"2","Millions of Americans in the United States will be able to see a total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. It will be the last chance for those in the lower 48 states to see one for 21 years. Even if you can’t get to the path of totality, which is where the moon’s shadow covers the sun, you’ll at least see a partial solar eclipse over the course of the day. So — if you’re wondering how you can witness what some folks call a life-changing event to why they happen in the first place, follow along here for answers to all of your questions and more."
"2","When the total solar eclipse comes to the United States on April 8, there is one rule you must remember: Never stare directly into the sun. Even when the sun is partially obscured by the moon, its rays are still strong enough to permanently damage your eyesight. The only time to look upon the eclipse without glasses is when the sun is fully covered by the moon during totality, which only will last three or four minutes, depending where you are. If you are not in the narrow path of the totality, spanning from Texas to Maine in the United States, this will not be an option for you. To look at the sun during the eclipse’s partial phase, you either have to find some eclipse glasses, or use an indirect method — like a pinhole projector (more on that below) — to view the eclipse. Because if you don’t, you risk permanent eye damage. So here’s a short guide to why staring at the sun is so bad for you, and what you need to look out for when purchasing (you can still get yours with rush shipping ) or using eclipse glasses. How the sun can burn a hole in your eyeball The sun is the most powerful source of energy in the solar system. It’s the most energetic object for light-years in all directions (it’s literally a huge fusion reactor). The energy it expels is so intense it can actually burn holes in your vision. And it’s particularly dangerous because of the anatomy of our eyes, Joel Schuman , chair of ophthalmology at NYU Langone Health, told me in 2017. When light enters our eyes, the lens focuses light to the retina, located in the back of the eye. We see thanks to the retina’s chemical sensors picking up on the presence of light and transmitting information to the brain. The retina can handle indirect sunlight just fine. But think of what happens when you hold a magnifying glass up to the sun. It focuses light intensely enough to start a fire. Something similar happens with the lens in your eye when it’s focused directly on the sun. “The light from the sun is very intense and concentrated into a very small area, and then that light is converted into heat and that heat cooks the retina,” Schuman said. “So you have a permanent area that you don’t see, a permanent blind spot.” What’s worse, a retina burn doesn’t heal like a sunburn on the skin. It actually doesn’t heal at all. Wikimedia Commons It doesn’t heal because the retina is nerve tissue, Schuman explained, which doesn’t readily regenerate. Think of it like a spinal cord tear: permanent. And because the light from the sun hits the center of the retina, this burn occludes the sharpest region of central vision. “Oh, 20 seconds probably, that’s all it took,” Louis Tomososki, an Oregon man who was partially blinded during a total solar eclipse in 1963, told a local NBC affiliate . “Looking at someone and being able see their face — but not their nose” is how he described it to NBC. In less severe cases, Schuman said, there may just be swelling in the retina. This can be treated with steroids or other anti-inflammatory drugs. So be sure, if you think your eyes have been damaged, to see a doctor for treatment! Normally we don’t look at the sun because it’s uncomfortable. But an eclipse is an opportunity to appreciate our place in the universe. In 1999, a solar eclipse passed over the United Kingdom. Just one hospital alone in Leicester had 45 patients complaining of eye trouble, the journal Lancet reported . Twenty of the cases involved burns or inflammation to the retina. So how do eclipse glasses work? On April 8, a total or partial solar eclipse will be visible from the entire continental United States . But wherever you are, “it is never safe to look directly at the sun’s rays — even if the sun is partly obscured,” NASA warns. Even when the sun is 99 percent obscured, it can still cause damage. That’s why during a partial eclipse — and even through the early and later phases of a total eclipse when you can see the last bits of sun peeking through the craters of the moon — you’ll need eye protection. You can only take off the protective glasses when the moon has completely covered the sun during totality. Regular sunglasses won’t block enough light. You’ll need glasses that filter all but 0.003 percent of visible light and block out most ultraviolet and infrared as well. “Such filters usually have a thin layer of aluminum, chromium or silver deposited on their surfaces that attenuates ultraviolet, visible, and infrared energy,” NASA’s eye safety page explains . Using photo or X-ray film is not safe . (The same goes for looking through binoculars, mirrored cameras, or telescopes: If you’re looking at the sun through them, you’ll need to put special filters on the lenses.) You could grab a pair of the darkest available (No. 14) welder’s glasses. But this is even easier: Pick up a dirt-cheap pair of disposable eclipse glasses. The American Astronomical Society (AAS) points out several manufacturers that meet international standards for eclipse eye protection. They are: Grafix Plastics Halo Eclipse Spectacles American Paper Optics / eclipseglasses.com Seymour Solar Flip’n Shades DayStar Filters Rainbow Symphony Thousand Oaks Optical (The AAS has more information on eclipse glasses retailers.) Importantly, the AAS does not recommend “searching for eclipse glasses on Amazon , eBay, Temu, or any other online marketplace and buying from whichever vendor offers the lowest price.” To avoid a counterfeit, the American Astronomical Society recommends using glasses purchased from its list of approved, vendors. Be sure to identify the manufacturer of the glasses and see that they are on the approved list above. (The AAS also has a helpful guide to spot fake or counterfeit glasses here .) The good news is you might be able to pick up a verified pair for free at a local library. The Space Science Institute has donated 5 million solar eclipse glasses to 10,000 libraries across the United States. Call your local library and ask whether they have any available. The safest way to view an eclipse: through a pinhole projector Or if you don’t want to risk looking directly at the sun at all, try making a pinhole projector. All it takes is a piece of paper and a pin. The pinhole mimics the properties of a lens, and it will project the image of the sun onto a flat surface. The Verge has a great, thorough guide on how this all works. One last reminder: If you’re in the path of the total solar eclipse , you can take off the protective glasses the moment the moon is covering the sun 100 percent. Actually, if you don’t, you’ll miss the best part of the whole phenomenon: seeing the sun’s outer atmosphere, the corona. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","On Tuesday, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen (R) urged his state’s legislature to change its rules for this year’s presidential election — a change that, if passed, would be very likely to flip one electoral vote from President Joe Biden to Donald Trump . Nebraska currently has an unusual way of distributing its five electoral votes. Rather than giving them all to the statewide winner — as 48 other states do — it awards two votes to the statewide winner, and the rest go to the winner in each of Nebraska’s three congressional districts. Nebraska is a deep red state that Trump won by a 19-point margin in 2020. However, Biden walked away with one of its electoral votes, because he won in Nebraska’s Second District, which includes the city of Omaha. Pillen and Trump want to switch this to a winner-take-all system, to lock down that vote for Trump. The stakes could be enormous: the single electoral vote from Nebraska’s Second District really could determine whether Trump or Biden wins in 2024. If Biden wins Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, while Trump wins Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada, and no other outcomes change from 2020, then Biden would need Nebraska’s Second District vote to win. If he doesn’t get it, the electoral vote would be a 269-269 tie. The new House of Representatives would break the tie with each state delegation getting one vote, and since Republicans will almost surely control more state delegations, that means a tie likely goes to Trump. Importantly, though, it’s very unclear whether Nebraska Republicans have the votes to change this law. They would have to overcome a filibuster in the state legislature to do it, and Democrats in the state profess optimism that the GOP doesn’t have the votes. And even if the rule change does pass, Democrats have an obvious option for a response: changing the rules in Maine. Maine is the only other state that splits its vote by congressional district, but there, the current rule benefits Trump — it delivered him one elector in a state Biden won. Democrats could, in theory, change Maine’s rules and cancel out any advantage gained by Trump. But beyond the angling for partisan advantage, it is true that Nebraska’s and Maine’s rules are kind of odd — quirky historical accidents that arguably should be brought in line with the way the other 48 states do it. The fair way to do it would be for both to change their rules in the same cycle, standardizing the winner-take-all rule without handing either candidate an advantage. Why oddball Nebraska and Maine split their votes by congressional district The history of the Electoral College system is a bizarre one , but the modern norm of how it works is: each state holds a statewide vote, and the top candidate in that vote would get all of that state’s electors. That’s the winner-take- all system. In the nation’s earliest decades, there was more variety. Some states didn’t give voters a direct say at all, letting state legislators simply pick electors. Others did hold a statewide vote, but counted the results in separate districts of the state, awarding electors that way. The district system could allow regional differences to be represented. But it watered down a state’s impact on the national outcome, as compared to the winner-take-all system where all a state’s votes went to one candidate. And as partisan competition intensified, states flocked to winner-take-all — the district system was gone by the 1830s , and stayed gone for more than a century. Then, in the latter half of the 20th century, it came back. Two states decided to switch to a system where two electoral votes would go to the statewide winner, and one electoral vote to the winner in each congressional district. The first was Maine, in 1969, which adopted a proposal from an idiosyncratic legislator, whose apparent motivation was to help voters with different views be reflected in the Electoral College results. (Maine had used the district system back in the 1820s.) The second was Nebraska, in 1991, where legislators hoped to get presidential candidates to pay more attention to the state rather than writing off all its electoral votes as safely Republican. One might think that proposals like this would move the Electoral College closer to proportional representation — but often, these proposals are just partisan dirty tricks. Republicans in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have batted around the idea, believing gerrymandered congressional maps would guarantee them more than half the electors in swing states that more often lean Democratic. But Maine and Nebraska do not seem to have had partisan motivations — and at first, there was no partisan impact, or indeed, any impact, because the statewide winner kept also winning every congressional district in both states. As urban-rural partisan polarization intensified, that started to change. In 2008, Barack Obama won Nebraska’s Second District. Republicans responded by making the district more conservative in redistricting, but the underlying polarization trends continued and by 2020 Biden won it again. In Maine, the rural Second District swung to Trump in both 2016 and 2020. (Neither district was all that close in 2020 — Biden won NE-2 by 6.5 percentage points, and Trump won ME-2 by 7.5.) So we’ve ended up with a system where 48 states use winner-take-all, and then two states throw a stray electoral vote to someone every so often, which is pretty odd — just one of many ways the US’s method of picking a president is ridiculous . What’s going on in Nebraska now As partisanship and polarization have risen, Nebraska Republicans have attempted to respond. Back in 2016, they tried to switch to a winner-take-all electoral vote system. But there was a problem — the filibuster. Yes, the Cornhusker State is the rare state to have a legislative filibuster with a strong supermajority requirement. In fact, it’s stronger than the US Senate’s — a two-thirds vote, or 33 of 49 legislators, is necessary to overcome a filibuster in Nebraska. And though Republicans have regularly had big majorities, it’s proven maddeningly difficult for them to get over that hump. They fell just one vote short in 2016. The latest push kicked off on Tuesday, when conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote on X about a nightmare scenario for Trump supporters where Nebraska’s Second District could throw this year’s election to Biden. He urged Nebraskans to “call their legislators and their governor to demand their state stop pointlessly giving strength to their political enemies.” Just hours later, Gov. Pillen made his announcement that, “in response to a call out for his support,” he supported such a change, and Trump praised him in a Truth Social post. (You might get the impression that this was not entirely an organic grassroots phenomenon.) But many doubted that they had the votes. Republicans had 32 seats — one vote short of the 33 seats necessary to beat a filibuster. The plot thickened on Wednesday when a Democratic state senator, Mike McDonnell, announced he was switching parties to the GOP — seemingly providing the necessary vote. Then the plot, er, thinned when McDonnell told Politico’s Elena Schneider that he would still support filibustering the electoral vote change. Nebraska’s legislative session is scheduled to end on April 18, so we’ll get some clarity about whether Republicans have the votes soon enough. If they do manage to muscle the change through, Maine Democrats (who control the legislature and the governorship in their state) will face pressure to respond in kind. As they should — if Biden loses his shot at a stray electoral vote, Trump should lose his too. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","I n recent weeks, it’s become apparent that there is a rather concerning rift in the conservative movement. It’s difficult to put a finger on, but it starts to look like a gaping chasm if you start to spend time on X. Candace Owens recently parted ways with the Daily Wire, one of the largest conservative media companies — and it wasn’t on good terms. While neither the Daily Wire nor Owens will say exactly what happened, it seems pretty obvious that they didn’t see eye to eye on certain fundamental issues. (READ MORE: I Read Ellen ‘Elliot’ Page’s Pageboy , and It Shows Just How Half-Baked Transgenderism Is ) The result? A raging debate on X over whether saying, “Christ is King,” is anti-Semitic — all made even more offensive to all parties involved given that the debate took place over the weekend of Palm Sunday. Owens and the “Christ is King” debate didn’t cause the rift; they simply highlighted it. Modern conservatism is a mishmash of thoughts and ideas. It’s a huge tent that currently houses anyone who doesn’t think the government should be giving free drugs to homeless people, free housing to the illegal immigrants flooding over our border, or funding for innocent children to be mutilated by our woke healthcare industry. The problem is that while a lot of us agree on what society shouldn’t look like, we don’t always have the same vision for what it should look like. (READ MORE: New York Times : The Country Is Going to Hell, but Be Happy ) Young Americans have not just inherited a broken economy and culture from ancient elites who are older than their grandparents; they, especially the conservatives among them, have inherited an ill-defined response team that has been the underdog for so long that every time it gets power, it’s scared to use it. On next week’s Spectacle podcast, Melissa Mackenzie and Scott McKay will be talking to some of The American Spectator’s young editors and writers about the direction of our country and what conservatism means to the next generation.

"1","I n the grand circus of politics, where elephants and donkeys alike perform under the big top, there’s one act that never fails to draw a crowd: the venerable “job creation” routine. Putting people back to work, especially those without college degrees and in the manufacturing world, is in the center ring. Unfortunately, when you look behind the smoke, mirrors, and rabbits hidden in hats, you’ll see that promises to rebuild America through industrial policy are just plain old corporate welfare. Industrial policy has made an amazing comeback. In its name, the Biden administration and Congress have authorized between $1.2 and $2.1 trillion in domestic subsidies for preferred manufacturing industries in sectors such as clean energy, advanced manufacturing, construction, transportation, and broadband. The ringmaster and his assistants assure the crowd that they’ll deliver tens of thousands of new, high-paying jobs for workers with no more than high-school diplomas. Meanwhile, on the right, industrial policy is being discussed as a way to boost manufacturing employment for men left behind in the Rust Belt. The job- creation argument for showering businesses with billions more in subsidies might surprise those of you are aware of America’s remarkably low unemployment rate. Indeed, given that handful of people will always be between jobs, a 3.9 percent rate signals that very few who want employment can’t find it. Instead, what’s animating these politicians is the exodus from the labor force of mostly poorly educated males. The reasons for this workforce withdrawal are complex and beyond the usual scapegoats, like trade and market forces. But this topic I will save for another column. Instead, let’s focus on the reality that industrial policy subsidies and tax breaks will flow to companies, often big and rich, for projects they would likely have taken on anyway. That means they probably won’t create net new jobs. Even if these subsidies were to create a manufacturing boom, it probably wouldn’t lead to an employment boom because most manufacturing output today is produced by robots. And even if the subsidies benefit workers indirectly, the beneficiaries will be largely college-educated and in higher-income groups rather than those working assembly lines. The golden era of widespread, good manufacturing jobs that so many politicians are nostalgic about is over. It’s been going away for 70 years. So, industrial policy won’t create jobs for poorly educated workers, but it will supercharge cronyism. The Cato Institute’s Chris Edwards notes that Biden’s industrial policy is better described as a corporate welfare bonanza. The Inflation Reduction Act, he writes, “handed out $868 billion in energy subsidies, most of it to big corporations, including automakers, utilities, manufacturers, and hydrogen producers. Adam Michel finds that Biden’s energy tax subsidies could top $1.8 trillion.” The CHIPs and Science Act of 2022 gave $54 billion in subsidies to a who’s who of corporate and Silicon Valley elite. Ditto with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, which subsidized railroads, electric utilities, broadband companies, the EV industry, and others to the tune of $548 billion. Unfortunately, when the government is in the business of distributing favors, corporations devote less effort to producing and more to seeking those favors. The result is “unproductive entrepreneurship,” where innovators use their skills to extract government privileges instead of putting new, better and cheaper goods and services on the market. Finally, contrary to the anti-big business rhetoric blaring from the Biden administration, it has granted a large amount of narrow corporate tax breaks to big companies. In fact, Edwards finds that since being in power, “President Biden has increased annual average corporate tax expenditures 92 percent from $109 billion to $209 billion.” He notes that tax- code expenditures “have increased from $0.3 billion a year projected under Trump to $29 billion a year under Biden.” Despite the grand promises of revitalizing the American workforce and bringing prosperity to forgotten corners of the country, the reality is that industrial policy is typically a conduit carrying corporate welfare, benefiting the already powerful and wealthy as it discourages genuine innovation and market-driven economic opportunities. As we peer behind the scenes of this circus act, it becomes clearer that sustainable employment and economic prosperity will be generated not by subsidies but by unleashing market forces, which will promote entrepreneurship and innovation. Only by moving away from the spectacle can we hope to address the challenges underlying the American workforce and pave the way for a more prosperous and inclusive future.

"1","T he Miami Open at Hard Rock Stadium was a dramatic tournament this year, with the tough and persistent and courageous Danielle Collins riding a low seed — was she seeded at all? — all the way to the win, her first and likely her last Masters 1000, unless she revises her plan to retire at the end of this season. The pride of St. Petersburg always wanted this one, and she certainly earned it. She is one of the most hard-working, never-quit, gritty American girls, with a powerful game from the baseline, and she was deservedly the crowd fave and said really classy things when presented with the trophy, thanking not only her team and the sponsors but the security officials and the medics who spring from the sidelines in response to sprains and cramps. On the men’s side, you could say the same about hard work rewarded for finalist Grigor Dimitrov, with the caveat that he did not quite make it. Also, he has more than a baseline game; Dimitrov is aggressive at the net, has a gorgeous one- handed backhand, and hustles like crazy on every point. He had a fantastic, inspiring run, but this year seems to belong to Jannik Sinner, who knocked him out in the final, 6–3, 6–1. It’s a bit early to speak of the whole year, of course, but still it was astonishing how the Australian Open winner breezed through the draw and beat Dimitrov handily. Dimitrov had got past the mighty Hubert Hurkacz (three sets), world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz (two sets), and fourth seed Alexander Zverev (three sets). Dimitrov has been on a gorgeous mid-career resurgence after some tough years with injuries, which proves you should never say quit. But Sinner, who beat both Novak Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev on the way to the Australian Open trophy, is just too good at the moment. The six-two Tyrolean with the form, the feet, the forehand, the impossible down-the-line backhand, the grace — well, you get the picture. His court sense, aka strategic and tactical intelligence, has overwhelmed everybody this year. Alcaraz put it very well : He said Sinner made him feel as though he was 13, flummoxed by Sinner’s game. The shot choices, the placement, require impeccable movement, and it is not irrelevant that, like Djokovic and Roger Federer, Sinner was a passionate skier as a teen, a juniors champ. Skiing develops the feet, the knees, the “foundation” — abs and lower back — so essential to match play. American youth sports teams and organizations spend far too much money on secondary items, such as fancy facilities and paraphernalia. There probably are too many school district and athletic associations administrators, too. The focus should be on physical training, learning different sports, getting a grounding in how to think about sports, sports history, chess, and academic subjects. In America we are addicted to throwing money at everything except the basics, and that is why we are on our heels against the barbarians who threaten Judeo-Christian civilization. Meanwhile the New York Yankees had a great opening series against Houston, and they are in first place and unbeaten going into the second week, so take that, Boston. However — not to get off the point but to stay focused on fair and accurate reporting — anyone interested in Boston ought to forget about the travails of Harvard University’s poor show lately and consider a superb Boston novel, an American novel, a great story of our country and our history, Dennis Lehane’s The Given Day , which I am sure I or one of my pals here at The American Spectator will account for one of these days. In other tennis news, the wonderful, unseeded, all American women’s doubles team of the irresistible Bethanie Mattek-Sands and the pugnacious, determined Sofia Kenin took the doubles at Miami in a thriller, while the wonderful class-act Aussie-Indian team of Matt Ebden and Rohan Bopanna continued their dream run since winning the Australian Open, also a thriller. Thrill is in the eyes of the observer, you may say, but objectively and going by the old fair-and-accurate, in doubles if you need at least one tie-break and a third set super-tiebreak (first to ten with two-point spread), as both the women and men’s winning teams did, I think it’s fair and accurate to use the term without risking drama inflation. Baseball season did not start so well for the Dodgers — I always said they never should have left Brooklyn — with a betting scandal involving their Babe Ruth lookalike from Japan, Shohei Ohtani . Babe Ruth, I should note, has an important role in The Given Day ; whether it is accurate historically I cannot say, but it does get the Babe right. However, this gambling matter is embarrassing. I don’t care much for gambling, but a man — or even a woman — can throw his money away in a free country. The problem is that, in sports, obviously, it’s one of those areas where the possibility of corruption is high — point shaving, throwing games, tanking, faking injuries, and so on; you have read too many stories, real and fictional, to be able to pretend it ain’t so. In this appalling case — the Dodgers have something like $1 billion now invested in its team’s payroll and the team still can’t get its act together to be a credible Series contender — the investigation(s) are still on, so I dasn’t comment. But it ain’t pretty. What this country needs is a serious moral revival, no less than a basic downsizing of government. Anyway, the Iowa star Caitlin Clark led the Hawkeyes over Louisiana State University Monday night in the girls’ NCAA; they go up against UConn next. On the boys’ side, Purdue–North Carolina State is coming up on the weekend. And the clay court season in tennis begins; baseball heroics continue despite the cash avalanche; the shows go on. Don’t pay any mind to my gratuitous advice, but I’d say catch some of the basketball, stay focused on your own workout schedule, drink water and tea, give a low priority to IRS deadlines — I mean, obviously, request a delay if you need it and pay up later, they’re only going to throw your money away — and read The Given Day , as well as The Voice on the Back Porch and The Adventures of Augie March . Also the Federalist Papers. And a good week to all. Image: This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license."
"1","A controversy arose this week that is simultaneously a little-bitty nothing and a hornet’s nest of grand magnitude — because a little bit of truth and reality needs to be shouted from as high a rooftop as possible. And the subject is … women’s basketball. Not one of my preferred subjects. But as my alma mater, Louisiana State University, is the defending national champion in the sport — and as the LSU Tigers on Monday night played Iowa in front of a women’s record audience of 12 million people — the controversy that emerged from that game is actually somewhat relevant to our national discussion. Iowa won the game , by the way, which is something that Kate Kruse, the producer of The Spectacle podcast and an Iowa native, was very keen to reinforce to me on Tuesday when we recorded this week’s episodes. Iowa is a great team, and Caitlin Clark, the team’s star player who poured in 41 points to beat LSU , is to women’s basketball what Pete Maravich was to the men’s game. Clark has a little more about her than Maravich had, which is why it’s easy to see Iowa winning the national championship next week. But the game isn’t the controversy. The controversy is over the fact that LSU’s team wasn’t present on the court for the playing of the National Anthem: LSU Women’s Basketball Team skipped the National Anthem Iowa stood proud LSU just got their ass beat With the entire stadium cheering against them Season over Let this be a lesson to all players: the cringy, selfish woke athlete moment is OVER 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/ctskb0GXIC — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) April 2, 2024 I’m a Benny Johnson fan, and I’m cognizant of the fact that his being from Iowa makes this an emotionally charged issue for him. And Benny Johnson is anything but alone in sounding off with this kind of rhetoric about the pre-game occurrences at Monday night’s contest. But he’s wrong. He’s way off. And he ought to apologize. Here’s the truth about this stupid controversy, in a few easily digestible little factoids: First, LSU did not conduct a protest of the National Anthem on Monday night. The team just wasn’t on the court for it. Iowa was, which created some clunky optics for LSU’s program, but this had more to do with routines and logistics than a lack of patriotism. Second, LSU Coach Kim Mulkey, who is one of the best coaches — if not the best — in the women’s game (the job she’s done in three years rebuilding LSU’s program — including a Sweet Sixteen appearance, a national title, and an Elite Eight appearance — after building a dominant program at Baylor speaks to this), is anything but a woke leftist who fosters poor patriotism among her players. Believe me. If you’re a conservative, Mulkey is about as friendly to you as you’re going to get. There’s a reason woke journos at the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times have trashed her in the past week, and it’s not because she aligns too closely with them culturally and politically. Third, the presence of the teams on the court for the playing of the National Anthem at basketball games is a very on-and-off thing, and it’s often the product of decisions by the event managers. For example, at last year’s national championship women’s hoops contest featuring these same two teams, a game LSU won over Iowa, neither team was on the floor for the National Anthem. And if my information is correct, neither team was on the floor for the National Anthem during Monday night’s second game between Connecticut and Southern California. Fourth, LSU’s pre-game routine calls for a trip back to the locker room 12 minutes before tipoff. So what we have here is a massively overblown, stupid controversy that is fueled by a great deal of ignorance — not to mention the more than a little bit of market positioning that the mainstream media has performed on LSU’s team. It’s been presented as the Bad Girl of women’s college basketball largely because LSU’s star player, Angel Reese, talks a lot, and a few of the team’s other stars have a similar swagger. That and the media covering women’s basketball have hated Mulkey ever since she offered tepid, at best, support for the rather imperfectly patriotic Brittney Griner, her former star player at Baylor who trashed the country on her way to moonlighting as a pro player in Russia, only to find herself in one of the country’s prisons. All of this is utterly idiotic. Basketball games aren’t all-day affairs as football games are, and event management for basketball is a lot more compressed. It isn’t all that standard for a team to be on the floor for the National Anthem in men’s or women’s basketball; the Anthem is for the fans. Still, the reality now is that Mulkey is going to have to change her pre-game routine because of the toxic optics and blown-up controversy this has created. And while nobody seems to get this, Louisiana’s new governor, Jeff Landry, just did her a big favor by weighing in on this: My mother coached women’s high school basketball during the height of desegregation, no one has a greater respect for the sport and for Coach Mulkey. However, above respect for that game is a deeper respect for those that serve to protect us and unite us under one flag ! It is… — Jeff Landry (@JeffLandry) April 2, 2024 Landry could have sat this one out, but what he’s done is pretty smart and an interesting little lesson in red-state governance. Whether or not he understood the logistical nature of LSU’s absence on the court, he’s taken this thing out of Mulkey’s hands. She’s got to have her team on the court for the National Anthem from now on, simply because if not they’ll turn her into an anti-American villain. But with Landry stepping in to mandate not just her team’s presence for the National Anthem but that of all the teams at all of Louisiana’s public colleges, it’s out of her hands, and she’s now removed from the controversy. Then he went further and applied this to the individual players. No kneeling, period. That’s the part that really matters here, though it doesn’t apply to Mulkey’s players, none of whom have kneeled or even expressed a desire to kneel (at least, not to my knowledge). But it ends any further potential for this issue to poison college sports in the Bayou State because nobody on any team — whether at LSU, Louisiana Tech, the University of New Orleans, McNeese State, Grambling State University, or any of the others — really wants to put his or her scholarship in jeopardy over kneeling during the National Anthem. It’s a bit of opportunism, but it’s also a way to fix a problem that has been irritating people for going on a decade now. And he’s doing it while protecting the coaches of those teams, who, regardless of their own political affiliations, might have to recruit players from heavily Democrat families: “Well, it’s state policy that we stand for the National Anthem, so we all do it and that’s that.” Either way, we need to put this dumb controversy to bed before the friendly fire gets out of control.

"1","“A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country.” These familiar words of Jesus have been applied to many political situations down through the centuries. Perhaps no such application was more apt than the admonition offered to the Democratic Party at the outset of the New Deal and sadly ignored in subsequent decades. On the eve of the 1932 election, in a New York Times lead article, John W. Davis wrote “Why I Am a Democrat.” As the Democratic presidential nominee in 1924, Davis was still a leading party figure in 1932 and had authored the 1932 party platform. In this article, Davis confidently wrote, “If the Democratic party is successful [in the 1932 election], it will balance the budget; it will lop off useless bureaus, which those who created them are naturally reluctant to destroy … and it will take the strait jacket off the trade and commerce of the nation.” He added, “Instead of striving to give every man a share of governmental help, borrowing from impoverished Peter to pay poverty-stricken Paul, it will aim to make it possible for every man to help himself.” Again, on March 5, 1933, the day after President Franklin Roosevelt’s inauguration, Davis took to the pages of the New York Times in a lengthy feature article entitled “The Torch Democracy Keeps Alight.” He declared, “Policies come and go, but principles remain,” seeking to anchor the new administration to the Democratic Party’s historic principles first laid out by Thomas Jefferson. Davis reminded his fellow Democrats: The chief aim of all government is to preserve the freedom of the citizen. His control over his person, his property, his movements, his business should be restrained only so far as the public welfare imperatively demands. The world is in more danger of being governed too much than too little. Davis warned the government to refrain from any activity that “private initiative is willing and able to conduct.” He then extolled the importance of local self-governance as “indispensable to liberty.” “A centralized and distant bureaucracy,” he wrote, “is the worst of all tyranny.” Davis next turned to taxation and the need for government restraint. He set forth the traditional Democratic principle of taxation: “To tax one person, class, or section for the benefit of another is none the less robbery because done under the form of law and called taxation.” He exhorted the incoming administration to exercise “the courage to refuse and the willingness to forego expenditures which, even though desired by many people, are not demanded by absolute justice and necessity.” Davis saw the undergirding principle of his party as constitutionalism. He observed, “Since men do not lose their frailties by being chosen for office, Constitutions are necessary to prevent the exercise of arbitrary power.” In the face of receiving an overwhelming electoral mandate in the 1932 election, Davis warned his fellow Democrats that “[n]o majority, however large, and no argument, however plausible, can justify depriving a single citizen of any right guaranteed to him by the Constitution.” Finally, Davis sought to focus his party on the “pole star by which the Democrat must steer.” All the foregoing principles point in one direction: the worth and dignity of the individual. “This regard for the individual, his powers, his rights, his opportunities,” Davis wrote, “lies at the very root of the Democratic creed.” Traditional Democrats should reject any notion that the state is “the distributor of special grants of money or of privilege to chosen persons or selected classes.” The end of this story is the sad validation of Jesus’ words. Davis was indeed “a prophet … not without honor,” save in his own party. The ink was hardly dry on his March 1933 New York Times article before it became apparent that Roosevelt had no intention of honoring the 1932 Democratic Party platform. A balanced budget, tax reduction, and bureaucratic restraint were all abandoned. As the senior partner of Davis, Polk, and Wardwell, a top-drawer Wall Street law firm, Davis went on to become the “lawyers’ lawyer,” arguing more cases (141 in total) before the Supreme Court than any American save Daniel Webster. In 1936, Davis backed Alf Landon’s candidacy against FDR. From that point on until his death in 1955, Davis never endorsed another Democrat nationally. He became the leading advocate of conservative causes before the Supreme Court and was labeled by Roosvelt as “Public Enemy No.1.” Asked by a reporter shortly before his death if he was still a Democrat, Davis responded, “Yes. Damn still.” Since his death, the Democratic Party has steadily moved to the left, showing no inclination to return to the Jeffersonian principles so dear to John W. Davis. His prophetic warning continues to fall on deaf ears: The genuine Democrat is a traditional liberal, with a liberal’s outlook on life: loving freedom for freedom’s sake; believing in the wholesome virtue of self-help; hating privilege in whatever form; wishing nothing for himself from the government that his neighbor cannot enjoy; willing to think of the rights and interests of other men equally with his own. Sadly, his was a prophetic voice crying out in the wilderness. Garland S.

"2","Last year, the planet lost 9.2 million acres of its tropical forest, an area a bit larger than the entire state of Maryland, according to new data from environmental group World Resources Institute (WRI) and the University of Maryland. That’s like losing about 10 soccer fields of forest per minute — for an entire year. Obviously, that sounds bad. It is bad. For decades on end, the world has watched its rainforests disappear and give way to giant farms and cattle ranches that feed the public’s desire for meat and other food products. Roughly one-third of the world’s tropical forests are now gone. And that loss has fueled both the extinction crisis and climate change ; the carbon stored in trees often gets released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide after they’re cut down, helping warm the planet. Yet against this backdrop of destruction, there are a few different, more hopeful stories. The WRI analysis shows that, in a few regions, including Columbia and Brazil, deforestation declined dramatically last year or remained lower than it once was. In other words, more trees were left standing, compared to previous years. This is not only good news but it reveals something critical: With the right laws and good governance, countries can keep their tropical forests intact. Losing the planet’s rainforests is not inevitable. Where forests were destroyed last year The new analysis, based on an enormous amount of satellite imagery, found that the tropics lost slightly less forest in 2023, compared to 2022. You can see the recent dip in the chart below. It shows forest loss over the last two decades, nearly all of which is human-caused. But the amount of destruction is still substantial, Mikaela Weisse, director of WRI’s Global Forest Watch project, said in a call with reporters last week. “The overall tropical rates of primary forest loss remained stubbornly consistent with past years,” Weisse said. “All of that forest loss resulted in 2.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions,” she added, which is equivalent to almost half of all the greenhouse gas emissions in the US. The WRI analysis focuses on the tropics, because that is where the vast majority of global deforestation — the deliberate clearing of trees — takes place. Yet it also includes some broader statistics of global change, which show that there was a massive spike in forest loss worldwide last year compared to 2022 due to the record-breaking wildfires in Canada . Just three countries account for the bulk of the recent destruction in the tropics: Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Bolivia. That’s partly because they’ve got a lot to lose. Brazil, for example, is home to nearly a third of the world’s tropical forests, whereas the lion’s share of the Congo Basin rainforest — the second largest in the world — is in DRC. In most cases, topping the charts for destroying forests is as bad as it seems. In the DRC, for example, consistently high rates of forest loss are eroding the planet’s “last major carbon sink,” Elizabeth Goldman, a researcher at Global Forest Watch, said on the press call, “meaning that forest absorbs more carbon than it emits.” The problems here are especially challenging to solve. Many people clear patches of the forest with fire to grow food for their families, not to profit. A troubling situation is also occurring in Bolivia, where deforestation continues to surge. 2023 was the country’s third year in a row of record-breaking destruction, the analysis found — part of a decade-long trend of increasing loss, fueled by agriculture. (Colonies of Mennonites, a religious group, are behind much of this recent deforestation.) In Brazil and a handful of other countries, meanwhile, the high rate of forest loss masks what is actually a somewhat hopeful story. Bucking the trend: Brazil, Columbia, Indonesia Although Brazil lost nearly 3 million acres of tropical forest last year — much of which vanished from the Amazon — 2023 was actually a relatively good year. The country lost about a third less primary forest compared to 2022, a drop you can clearly see in the chart below, reaching the lowest level of loss since 2015. It’s a tale of two presidents: Jair Bolsonaro and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, better known as Lula. An icon of the left and a leader of Brazil’s Workers Party, Lula first governed between 2003 and 2011, a period that saw a massive drop in deforestation, at least partly due to his pro-environmental agenda. Then Bolsonaro came into power. The right-wing leader stripped enforcement measures , cut spending for science and environmental agencies, and fired environmental experts , among other activities largely in support of the agribusiness industry. Forests were flattened. Now, Lula is back, after again winning office for a term that started early last year. He’s promised to curtail deforestation, including by stepping up enforcement and tracking criminal activity. And so far, it seems he’s having some success, according to WRI and the Brazilian government . “We have the opportunity again of being a champion on climate, and Lula has promised to do that,” Ana Paula Vargas, Brazil program director at Amazon Watch, an environmental advocacy group, told me last summer. Related What Lula’s stunning victory means for the imperiled Amazon rainforest There’s more good news from Colombia, where destruction has similarly softened. Last year, the country’s rate of forest loss dropped in half, according to WRI, after several years of extreme deforestation — largely due to the region’s changing, complicated politics . Finally, there’s Indonesia, where there’s also a reason to be hopeful. Home to one of the world’s most diverse and carbon-rich tropical forests, complete with orangutans and tigers and the world’s largest flower , forest loss in Indonesia remains well below its peak of forest loss in the early 2010s (although the country did see a spike in deforestation last year, per the WRI analysis). A tractor applies pesticides to a soybean field in eastern Bolivia. Diego Giudice/Bloomberg via Getty Images For much of the last few decades, Indonesia has cleared forests to plant near rows of oil palm trees — the crops that produce palm oil, now among the most common oils worldwide. It’s used in everything from baby shampoo to ice cream. The industry has been incredibly destructive, to wildlife, local communities , and, really, the entire planet (the stability of which depends on keeping carbon in the ground). But about 10 years ago, the story began to change. Environmental activists launched campaigns against the most harmful palm oil companies . Indonesia’s government put stricter policies in place. Groups like WRI and TheTreeMap, a data organization, started monitoring deforestation more closely from space, making destruction harder to hide. And as a result, the industry — though still far from perfect — started cleaning itself up. Related Palm oil is actually not that bad (anymore) “I don’t want to sit here and say that the palm oil industry has suddenly become shiny green and sustainable, but it’s mostly stopped deforestation,” Glenn Hurowitz , the founder and CEO of Mighty Earth, an environmental advocacy group, told me last year. To be clear, countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Indonesia are still clearing their forests by the thousands of acres. It remains a problem that world leaders should not ignore. But the stories here also suggest that a different future for these ecosystems, among the most important in the world, is possible. Forests can be protected. Laws — and the enforcement of them — can root out harmful activities. Activism can actually transform an entire industry. Yes, what’s happening in places like Brazil and Colombia is just a speck of hope in a world of destruction, but it’s an important reminder that the fate of the world’s tropical forests is in our control.

"2","2024 is the biggest global election year in history and the future of democracy is on every ballot. But amid an international backsliding in democratic norms, including in countries with a longer history of democracy like India , Senegal’s election last week was a major win for democracy. It’s also an indication that a new political class is coming of age in Africa, exemplified by Senegal’s new 44-year-old president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye. The West African nation managed to pull off a free and fair election on March 24 despite significant obstacles, including efforts by former President Macky Sall to delay the elections and imprison or disqualify opposition candidates. Add those challenges to the fact that many neighboring countries in West Africa — most prominently Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, but other nations across the region too — have been repeatedly undermined by military coups since 2020 . Sall had been in power since 2012, serving two terms. He declined to seek a third term following years of speculation that he would do so despite a constitutional two-term limit. But he attempted to extend his term, announcing in February that elections (originally to be held that month) would be pushed off until the end of the year in defiance of the electoral schedule. Sall’s allies in the National Assembly approved the measure, but only after security forces removed opposition politicians , who vociferously protested the delay. Senegalese society came out in droves to protest Sall’s attempted self-coup, and the Constitutional Council ruled in late February that Sall’s attempt to stay in power could not stand. That itself was a win for democracy. Still, opposition candidates, including Faye, though legally able to run, remained imprisoned until just days before the election — while others were barred from running at all. The future of Senegal’s democracy seemed uncertain at best. Cut to Tuesday, when Sall stepped down and handed power to Faye, a former tax examiner who won on a campaign of combating corruption, as well as greater sovereignty and economic opportunity for the Senegalese. And it was young voters who carried Faye to victory. “What it tells us is that young people in the continent are becoming very assertive,” Joseph Sany , the vice president of the US Institute of Peace’s Africa Center, told Vox. “Very active in the party politics, right? Because they are the first victims when democracy does not deliver.” The strength of Senegal’s democracy depends on several factors that go beyond any single politician, including relatively robust, independent democratic institutions like the courts and, perhaps surprisingly, the military. Those elements set it apart from other African nations presently under military rule. “This election showed the resilience of the democracy in Senegal that resisted the shock of an unexpected postponement,” Adele Ravidà, Senegal country director at the lnternational Foundation for Electoral Systems, told Vox via email. “... after a couple of years of unprecedented episodes of violence [the Senegalese people] turned the page smoothly, allowing a peaceful transfer of power.” And though Faye’s aims won’t be easy to achieve, his win can tell us not only about how Senegal managed to establish its young democracy, but also about the positive trend of democratic entrenchment and international cooperation in African nations, and the power of young Africans. Senegal’s election is deeply important given challenges to democracy in Africa In Senegal, Sall had been trying to erode democratic norms for months prior to his decision to postpone elections back in February, leading some observers to worry that Senegal’s democracy was in serious danger. Sall “had taken the country through this whole odyssey whether he was going to go for a third term or not, which was very stressful,” Joseph Siegle, research director at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, said in a February interview with Vox. “ It led to protest and death; there were some 50 people who died in the protests , there were more restrictions on free press and just a growing sense that he was testing and weakening the democratic institutions.” There have been a series of coups in the Sahel — an African region roughly stretching from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east — starting with Mali in August 2020 . On the surface, it could look like these countries were dominoes falling, or that the coup phenomenon was somehow “ contagious .” (A coup can be defined as a sudden and violent change in power by extralegal means.) But coups remain a fairly rare phenomenon around the world, as the political scientists Jonathan Powell and Clayton Thyne demonstrate through their research. In a recent Voice of America piece, Powell and Thyne’s research showed that from 1950 through October 2023, there were 492 coup attempts globally, 245 of which were successful. Poverty, polarization, corruption, weak institutions, a lack of safety and security, and high inequality are important factors that drive nondemocratic transitions of power, but they don’t, on their own, necessarily trigger coups. Perhaps the biggest predictor of whether a coup will happen in any given country is precedent: Has there been a coup attempt before? Any sort of precedent, whether or not the attempt was successful, shows that it’s at least possible to try, and that other indicators for coup conditions are present. “If you’ve had a coup attempt in the last three years, controlling for a bunch of different factors, there are various studies that point to your probability of having a coup in the current year to be something between 25 and 40 percent, which is really, really high when you think about how rare these events are otherwise,” Powell told Vox in an interview last September . To think that coups are somehow contagious would both discount the complexity of why the phenomenon occurs, and ignore opposite trends of democratic entrenchment in Africa, particularly in Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, Sany said. What makes Senegal different? Since it gained independence from France in 1960, Senegal has never had a coup — military or civilian. Increasingly strong and competitive democracy has been the norm for Senegal, and the country’s civil society went out in great force over the past three years of Sall’s term to enforce those norms. “I think that it is really the victory of the democratic institutions — the government, but also civil society organization,” Sany said. “They were mobilized, from the unions, teacher unions, workers, NGOs. The civil society in Senegal is one of the most experienced, well-organized democratic institutions on the continent.” Senegalese civil society also pushed back against former President Abdoulaye Wade’s attempt to cling to power back in 2012, and the Senegalese people voted him out. Though governmental institutions like the courts and the National Assembly do not have equal power to the presidency in Senegal, it’s important to note the Constitutional Council’s independence back in February when it ruled that Sall could not push back elections. (The council oversees some parts of the electoral process and adjudicates electoral and election policy disputes between the president and members of the National Assembly, among other duties.) That decision clearly had the support of civil society, Sany said, but also international actors including the US, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and France, all of whom were united in reinforcing this decision — and pressuring Sall to reverse course . Such pressure is much easier to apply to civilian politicians than military leaders, which leads to another critical characteristic of Senegal’s democracy: Its military is highly professionalized and has not been politicized in the way that the militaries of other nations like Mali and Sudan have, experts told Vox. “In most of those countries, the military was designed for regime preservation, not for the preservation of the republic,” Sany said. Members of the Senegalese military are “extremely well-educated — the level of education is very high compared to other militaries in the region and then they have been exposed to national peacekeeping missions,” allowing the military to work with and learn from other professional forces. In a situation like that, the military is less likely to start a coup because they don’t see it as their job to have power. Senegal also doesn’t face the same risk as other nations from Islamist insurgencies like ISIS-West Africa Province — possibly due to the proliferation of Sufi Islam and the nation’s identity as politically secular — though there is always a possibility that regional insurgencies could spill over its borders. In countries where terror attacks are common, it becomes easier for military personnel to convince civilians that the way to security is to have the military in charge — although increased violence in the region despite the presence of military governments disputes that. Faye will still have his work cut out for him accomplishing the goals he campaigned on, including economic prosperity, transparency, food security, increased sovereignty, and the strengthening of democratic institutions. This will be important, especially for Senegal’s young people, who are at the forefront of another major trend. Young Africans will play an increasingly key role in the coming decades, both on the continent and on the global stage; Africa’s youth population (people aged 15 to 24) will make up approximately 35 percent of the world’s youth population by 2050, and Africa’s population is expected to grow from 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion during that time. In Senegal, people aged 10 to 24 make up 32 percent of the population, according to the UN . “These young people have connected to the rest of the world,” Sany said. “They see what’s happening. They are interested. They are smart. They are more educated.” And they have high expectations not only for their economic future but also for their civil rights and autonomy. The reality of government is always different from the promise of campaigning, but Faye’s election is part of a promising trend of democratic entrenchment in Africa, exemplified by successful transitions of power in Nigeria , Liberia , and Sierra Leone over the past year. To be sure, those elections were not without challenges, but on the whole, they provide an important counterweight to democratic backsliding. Senegalese people, especially the younger generation, have high expectations for what democracy can and should deliver for them. It’s up to Faye and his government to follow through.

"2","On Monday, April 8, millions of people will get to see the Great North American Eclipse. Most people on the continent will see a partial solar eclipse, the sun gradually getting smaller as the moon passes in front of it. But if you’re in exactly the right place — along the narrow path of totality that runs from Mexico to Indianapolis to Montreal — the moon is going to line up directly in front of the sun and completely block it out. “When it happens, it feels like magic. It feels supernatural,” says Shadia Habbal, a professor of solar physics at the University of Hawaii. “It hits you in every part of your body. You just feel like something is surrounding you. Something is taking you to a place you’ve never been before.” When the moon fully blocks the sun, it’s the only time you can see the sun’s atmosphere, the corona, which is made up of particles constantly shooting away from the sun. “Sometimes they’re streaming away happily,” says Habbal. “But sometimes you have what we call a storm or an explosion at the sun.” The sun’s corona is visible as the moon obscures the sun during the 2017 total solar eclipse. Carlos Avila Gonzalez/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images Radiation from solar storms often ends up hitting Earth, which can lead to beautiful phenomena like the northern lights. But it can also cause massive problems, like energy grid disruptions, major blackouts, or even taking down satellites. Despite how much damage solar storms can do to our tech on Earth, scientists are still struggling to predict them. And that’s because they don’t understand that much about how the corona works. Even though it extends millions of miles away from the surface of the sun into freezing cold space, the corona is still a million degrees hotter than the surface of the sun. And scientists aren’t sure why. Which is why Habbal became an eclipse chaser. I recently spoke with Habbal for an episode of Unexplainable , Vox’s podcast that explores scientific mysteries, unanswered questions, and all the things we learn by diving into the unknown. This conversation has been lightly edited and adapted for the website. Noam Hassenfeld You’ve been chasing solar eclipses for almost 30 years. You even founded a group, Solar Wind Sherpas , whose mission is to chase eclipses. How did you first get interested in studying these phenomena? Shadia Habbal I was doing models of the corona, trying to figure out what processes heat the corona. And I realized that the temperature was a critical piece of information I needed to have. But the data that was available at the time wasn’t giving me the answer I was looking for. So, I knew that eclipses were the key observations to get to that answer. Noam Hassenfeld So the first eclipse you saw was when you were already researching the corona? Shadia Habbal Yes, the first solar eclipse I saw was in 1995 in India, and it was a very, very short eclipse. It was 42 seconds long, but it was probably the most spectacular one I saw. The eclipse happened around 8 in the morning. And when it happened, I saw the corona, these rays upon rays just expanding from the sun, extending all the way to infinity, visually. But we only had 42 seconds, so I couldn’t spend too much time looking around or anything. We had to really pay attention to operating the cameras that we had. I thought, “Okay, one measurement and that’s it.” But we realized that one wasn’t enough. We had to keep trying. Noam Hassenfeld Where have you and your team been since then? Shadia Habbal We’ve been to Mongolia. We’ve been to Antarctica. We’ve been to Libya. We’ve been to Tatakoto in French Polynesia. To Svalbard, you know, northern Norway, beyond the Arctic Circle. We’ve been to Syria, Chile, Argentina, Zambia, and South Africa. And this one will be my 20th. Noam Hassenfeld Why do you need an eclipse to study the corona? Can’t you do this artificially, put something up to block out most of the sun? Shadia Habbal Well, because that doesn’t do as good a job as a natural eclipse. Noam Hassenfeld Why doesn’t it do as good of a job? Shadia Habbal It’s a very small blocker whereas the moon is huge. So it dims the light to the point where the sky is like nighttime. Noam Hassenfeld Ah, okay. Let’s say I go outside and I want to study the corona. If I hold up a quarter in front of the sun and block the sun, I still wouldn’t see the corona, because the coin is so close to my eye. Everything would be filled up with sunlight. Shadia Habbal Yes. With an eclipse, you get the very intricate structures very, very close to the sun, and you get everything that’s streaming away as you look farther away. So, you see this continuous transition from the surface outward that you don’t get with any other instruments at the moment. Noam Hassenfeld What are the instruments you use when you study the eclipse? Shadia Habbal Our optical systems are like very small telescopes. But the key element is something we call a spectrometer, which is like a prism when you let the light go through a prism and it splits the colors, and so we capture these different colors. And each color corresponds to a different temperature in the corona. Noam Hassenfeld Is it fair to say you’re creating a temperature map of the corona? Shadia Habbal Of the corona, yes, exactly. Noam Hassenfeld And that map is going to help make these models of how the corona works more accurate? Shadia Habbal Yes, exactly. Noam Hassenfeld Are we close at all to being able to use some of these models to be like, “Okay, we’ve got to prepare the electrical grid, we’ve got to prepare the satellites for a solar storm?” Shadia Habbal Not yet. We have some clues. We know what’s causing them, but we can’t predict when they will happen. And that’s one of the things we’re trying to gather some more information from our eclipse observations. Noam Hassenfeld Are we any closer than we were 30 years ago? Shadia Habbal Yes, but we still don’t have a full … we don’t have a reliable answer. Noam Hassenfeld I like that you can laugh about that. What would you say is the biggest obstacle in eclipse observations or chasing eclipses? Shadia Habbal The weather. Noam Hassenfeld Ok, now I’m laughing. Shadia Habbal It’s true! We lost 40 percent of our observations to clouds. Noam Hassenfeld Wow, 40 percent? Shadia Habbal Mmhm. Noam Hassenfeld So out of how many eclipses? Shadia Habbal 20\. For example, this would be my 20th. We lost 40 percent. We lost eight. Noam Hassenfeld I imagine that’s got to be really disappointing. Shadia Habbal Well, it’s heartbreaking, yes. Because, so, many times what happens during, just a little bit before totality, the temperature drops and you have atmospheric conditions that happen suddenly. Once in South Africa, it was perfectly crystal clear skies and a cloud formed smack in front of the sun just before totality. Here was a cloud, it just decided to be right in front of the sun and then it dispersed the moment the eclipse was over. The moon partially eclipses the sun as clouds largely obscure the sky in Odesa, Ukraine, on October 25, 2022. Yulii Zozulia/Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images Noam Hassenfeld So you’re set up, you have your equipment, a cloud shows up, and then you’re just done? You can’t do anything? Shadia Habbal Yeah, you lost everything. You have no data. And another time we were in Kenya, we had a sandstorm just 15 minutes before the eclipse. We were close to a lake and basically the wind pattern shifted. And then all of a sudden we were looking toward the sun and a colleague of mine turned around and he said, “ Oh! S… H—” [Habbal begins to spell the word — you know which one — and then stops herself] I said, “ What’s the matter?” We looked back and this huge cloud was coming barreling toward us. Noam Hassenfeld What did you do? Shadia Habbal We covered the equipment. We had to. It was very, very fast. And we were totally clouded out. Noam Hassenfeld It just seems like there must be a better way to do this. Shadia Habbal Well, there are ways. Recently we were in Antarctica and unfortunately we were clouded out. It was really heartbreaking because the sky was crystal clear the day before. And crystal clear two hours after totality. One of my colleagues, he just came up with the idea and said, “why don’t we fly a kite?” Noam Hassenfeld Fly a kite? Shadia Habbal Well, it’s not just any type of kite. It’s quite large, it has a wingspan of about 6 and a half meters. We attached a spectrometer to it. The idea is that if it’s cloudy with a kite, you can go up to 4–5,000 meters and you can get above the clouds, and we tried it last year in Australia. Noam Hassenfeld What was it like testing something like this? Were you nervous? Shadia Habbal Yes, we were very nervous, but it was the most exhilarating experience. It was like watching the Sputnik. And the other option we’re trying this year is [working with] NASA’s research aircraft called the WB-57 . Now that airplane flies up to 60,000 feet where there are no clouds. Noam Hassenfeld And that airplane, is it flying along the path of totality? Shadia Habbal Exactly. The engineers and the pilots of this NASA project can follow the path of totality. Noam Hassenfeld How close are we to being able to predict the corona? Are all these measurements helping these predictions? Shadia Habbal Yes, but like any scientific research, you discover something and then you discover that there’s a lot more to discover. This is the beauty of scientific research is you’re never done. Noam Hassenfeld So, you’re just gonna keep on chasing eclipses for the rest of your career? Shadia Habbal I’ll keep on chasing eclipses until I can’t chase them anymore, and then somebody else has to do it. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Truth Social, Donald Trump’s social media platform, has not exactly been a resounding business success story, but it recently made the former president a whole lot richer. That’s because Trump Media, the network’s parent company, went public last week and catapulted Trump’s net worth to an estimated $7.5 billion. Now you might be wondering how Trump’s social media company is worth that much money. And the short answer is: It isn’t. On Monday, after the company reported more than $58 million in losses against a mere $4 million in revenue last year, the stock went tumbling down, plummeting by some 21 percent in a single day . But even so, when stocks closed on Wednesday, the company was valued at around $6.6 billion, putting it in a similar league as social media giants like Reddit . (When Trump Media first went public, its market capitalization peaked at roughly $10 billion .) The long answer, however, is that while Trump Media’s valuation is entirely illogical from a financial perspective — as one finance professor told CNN , “The stock is pretty much divorced from fundamentals” — its early success in trading can be boiled down to one simple fact: Donald Trump is running for president, and there’s a decent chance that he’ll be back in the White House this time next year. Truth Social, in other words, is a way for Trump’s supporters to personally offer him financial support at a time when he desperately needs it . That might be why the company’s volatility looks similar to meme stocks for now. As one analyst told my colleague Nicole Narea , people might buy up Trump Media stock so “they can express their beliefs and commitment.” For those with deep pockets, it’s also an opportunity to curry favor with the former president. Why does any of this matter? Before becoming one of the world’s richest 500 people on Bloomberg’s billionaires index for the first time last week, Trump was in financial trouble. He was cash-strapped and on the hook for nearly half a billion dollars because of two civil suit verdicts, and the attorney general of New York was preparing to seize some of his assets . He has since averted that outcome — at least for now — after the court reduced his required bond and he secured an 11th-hour bond agreement . vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page . Subscribe As I’ve written before , Trump’s financial problems are not just worrisome for him but for the whole country. His enormous debts would be a serious liability for any candidate for public office, let alone the presidency. It’s hard to know how worried to be, however: Trump’s finances are quite opaque. But read another way, that means that not only do his businesses — which he refused to divest from when he was president and which continued to work with other countries during his time in the White House — present potential conflicts of interest, but the public also has few ways of knowing the extent of those conflicts, or what they might even be. On the plus side, that Trump Media is publicly traded makes Trump’s finances slightly more transparent because we can keep track of who the major shareholders might be. But that alone isn’t enough because when Trump Media went public, it became an avenue for exactly the kind of corruption I was writing about. “It puts him in a position where he could be subjected to outside influence by foreign entities and other special interests at the cost, perhaps, of US national security or other interests,” Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told Vox. Daniel Steinle/Bloomberg via Getty Images But if buying stocks is legal, how could it lead to corruption? Imagine, for example, you were a wealthy lobbyist looking to influence a second Trump administration . You’ve already maxed out on contributions to his campaign, but want to stand out even more and show Trump that you have his back. You could become a member at Mar-a-Lago, or hunt for alternative PACs to channel money into (like one linked to the Republican National Committee that is designed to have donors pay Trump’s legal bills) . Or, you could turn to his public company and buy up a bunch of stock to help it stay afloat. Should he become president again, you could have leverage over him because if you decide to dump your shares, you could put a dent in Trump’s overall net worth. Now here’s a more tangible example: As Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington pointed out on X , the biggest institutional investor in the shell company that merged with Truth Social was GOP megadonor Jeffrey Yass, who also happens to be a major investor in TikTok’s parent company . While there’s no proof that Yass played a direct role in Trump changing his stance on whether or not TikTok should be banned, Trump did only change his tune after building up his business relationship with Yass . It’s unclear how much stock Yass still owns in Trump Media after the merger, but that’s just one example of how messy these potential conflicts of interest can be. That’s not to mention the possibility of foreign businesses, governments, or oligarchs flocking to buy up shares in Trump’s company, putting him in direct violation of the Constitution’s emoluments clause should he win in November. That’s an accusation that plagued his presidency, when foreign governments spent millions of dollars renting out rooms at his hotels or leasing office space in his buildings . “It’s not good for the country if we were to elect a president who, again, is really in business to enrich himself and [Trump Media] provides a direct vehicle for those seeking his favor to do so,” Canter said. And that, in the end, is why Trump’s potential return to the White House is so dangerous: In addition to having plenty of bad and reckless ideas, his presidency could be up for sale.

"2","The biggest US travel event of this year might not be Taylor Swift’s sold-out concert tour or a long-awaited March Madness face-off . Instead, it could well be the upcoming solar eclipse on April 8 , which could see as many as 4 million people in the US journeying to view it. This year’s total solar eclipse is particularly special for the US: Although the phenomenon happens globally every 18 months , this one will be visible across a huge swath of the country, making witnessing it more accessible. Plus, the eclipse is expected to last longer than the prior one did in 2017, adding to its allure. When it comes to the scale of travel we can expect, it’s “equivalent to having 50 Super Bowls simultaneously from Texas to Maine,” says Michael Zeiler, who helps run the Great American Eclipse website. Such tourism is set to generate upward of $1 billion in revenue across numerous cities, from Austin, Texas, to Rochester, New York. These cities will all be prime places to see the eclipse, which will be fully visible in parts of the southern US, the Midwest, and New England. NASA's interactive map shows best times, places to watch total solar eclipse https://t.co/KMh6vmdvdM — ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) April 3, 2024 Hotels and campgrounds in places where the full eclipse will be visible have long been sold out, with tens of thousands of visitors expected to flock to these cities. “This is likely going to be the single biggest tourism event we’ve ever had,” Michael Pakko, a University of Arkansas economist, tells the Washington Post , regarding the more than $100 million in revenue the state is expecting. Towns and businesses are also going all out by investing in eclipse music festivals, theme park rides, and viewing parties. Those traveling for this year’s eclipse join a long tradition of eclipse-chasers, who’ve been in awe of these events and who revel in sharing this communal experience. The rarity of such phenomena and the opportunity to enjoy them simultaneously with others bolsters their draw, experts say. The interest in eclipse tourism also comes as people’s willingness to travel has rebounded following the pandemic . “The simple now-or-never of an eclipse is extremely motivating,” Jaime Kurtz , a psychology professor at James Madison University, told Vox. “The collective enthusiasm for the eclipse might also be a driving force. It’s unifying.” There’s something about eclipses Eclipse-chasers, or people who seek out eclipses when they happen, are drawn to this phenomena because of how unique it is, how infrequently it happens, and how much wonder it inspires. Some also have a specific interest in astronomy and space, and see eclipses as a way to explore that. “It lifts you out of your everyday experience, and is such a remarkable feeling to be suddenly enveloped by a wave of darkness for a few minutes; it’s like standing on the surface of an alien planet,” said Zeiler, who has seen 11 eclipses on six continents. Zeiler traces a growing trend of eclipse tourism to the 1970s, when a group of astronomy enthusiasts first organized a cruise off the coast of Nova Scotia to see a solar eclipse. Since then, traveling to see eclipses has only become more popular as fascination with the phenomena has grown. “No matter what I do, no matter how much I describe it, no matter how many videos you watch, they all fall short of being able to witness this for yourself,” Fred Espenak, an astrophysicist and eclipse-chaser, told Vox’s Brian Resnick and Joss Fong . The event is also rarely visible to this degree in the US. In 2017, the eclipse had a narrower “path of totality,” or a smaller area where it could be seen in full from start to finish. This year, 31.6 million people already live in that larger path, making it easier for people to travel to it. And the next total solar eclipse to be visible in the US isn’t expected until the 2040s, which makes the upcoming one a prized experience. “One of the reasons that we get value from experiences is because we think of them as less interchangeable than other ways that we could spend our money,“ Amit Kumar , a marketing and psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin, told Vox. Eclipses are also a singular event because so many people across the country — and world — are witnessing the same thing at the same time, fueling a feeling of connectivity and community that can be particularly powerful, Kumar said. The desire to share in that feeling is just one factor that helps explain the high numbers of people willing to travel for this phenomenon, with local economies reaping benefits in the process. “Each eclipse is different. And that’s why we keep going again and again,” says Zeiler. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","When a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan’s eastern coast on April 3, the first concern involved the risk to people and property. Here, the news was not as dire as initially feared — only nine people have been reported killed as of Wednesday evening, along with hundreds of injuries. Considering that Wednesday’s quake was the strongest in Taiwan in 25 years — and that earthquakes of similar strength have killed tens of thousands of people or more in other countries — this could have been much worse. Taiwan was largely able to withstand such a powerful quake because the island has taken earthquake preparation seriously, strengthening its building codes after past disasters and drilling its population in how to respond . The newest buildings tended to fare best — the 1,670-foot Taipei 101, the island’s tallest building and designed to dampen shaking in a quake , barely moved. There was one other way in which Taiwan — and the world — avoided a worse outcome from the earthquake: the island’s all-important semiconductor manufacturing industry seemed to emerge largely intact. That’s good news — but it’s also a reminder of how fragile some of the most important nodes of the global economy remain. The world’s computers can’t run without Taiwan To say that Taiwan is important to the global tech industry is like saying oxygen is important to breathing. Taiwan as a whole is responsible for making 80 to 90 percent of the world’s most advanced computer chips — ones for which there is no current substitute. Taiwan’s TSMC makes up half of that production on its own , and 90 percent of the chips TSMC makes are produced in its 12 fabrication plants — or “fabs” — on the island. Fortunately, all of those fabs are on the western side of the island, away from the epicenter of the April 3 quake. Even a slight vibration, though, is enough to throw off the highly sensitive work of semiconductor manufacturing, and some machinery was halted or even damaged . But TSMC reported that production was getting back to normal within a few hours of the quake . Again, preparation made a difference — TSMC has invested heavily in earthquake resilience in its fabs, which the company says are designed well beyond code . But part of the reason that Taiwan has made itself so resilient to earthquakes is that it has a long history of … earthquakes. The island sits on the Ring of Fire, which is the unusually cool name for the 25,000-mile long belt of volcanoes and earthquakes that surround the Pacific Ocean. As a result, Taiwan experiences around a thousand earthquakes per year that are strong enough to be felt, and many more that aren’t. And just last year Taipei discovered an actual active volcano within its city limits . After a 1999 earthquake that did more damage to Taiwan’s chip-building infrastructure, the electronics industry was disrupted for weeks — and that was at a time when tech and computer chips were far less important to the global economy than they are today, when chips are found in everything from cars to refrigerators. A Credit Suisse analysis found that if TSMC’s operations were to be somehow shut down — perhaps by an even more massive quake — manufacturing across the global economy would be severely disrupted. And, of course, earthquakes and volcanoes are just one threat to Taiwan’s semiconductor foundries. The better known one is just 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait, where the People’s Republic of China has made it increasingly clear that it could be willing to use military power to force reunification with what it regards as a renegade province. Should Taiwan’s chip foundries be destroyed in such a conflict, the damage to the global economy could be on par with the Great Depression . The fragile points of global tech Is it the safest thing in the world to concentrate production of perhaps the single most important manufactured component of the global economy on one island that faces existential threats of both the seismic and geopolitical varieties (plus the occasional typhoon )? Not really. But Taiwan is hardly the only critical node in tech manufacturing that happens to be located in a risky part of the world. South Korea is maybe the second-most important location for semiconductor fabrication after Taiwan, with a 60 percent market share of the memory chips used in PCs and smartphones, and is the home of the major global tech player Samsung. South Korea also abuts North Korea , a nuclear-armed state run by a dictator who appears to be increasingly flirting with the possibility of war on the Korean peninsula. It’s also at risk from storms and flooding , though at least its tectonics are fairly stable. ( Maybe ?) How about Japan? It’s no longer the dominant player it was in the go-go 1980s, though the government has spent billions to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the country , and it now has about 10 percent of the global market . Japan is also one of the most disaster-prone countries on Earth — it’s at risk from earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, and typhoons . And should a war with either North Korea or with China over Taiwan come to pass, Japan will surely be on the front line . The US? Well, America hasn’t been a semiconductor hub in quite some time, though the Biden administration is trying its best to change that ( with mixed success ). But it’s worth noting that the intellectual nerve center of global tech, the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, sits on several major fault lines , including the San Andreas Fault. A major earthquake is a matter of when, not if. Would it be better if more global tech manufacturing was concentrated in a safer place — like Syracuse, New York, perhaps the safest city in the US according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Risk Index? Sure. But that’s highly unlikely to happen. The reality is that something as incredibly complex as the global tech manufacturing supply chain is inherently going to be fragile. The best we might be able to hope for is that the areas where we have concentrated that vulnerability take every step they can to prepare for that risk. Taiwan — at least when it comes to earthquakes — has done that. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","California’s progressive Democrats like to present themselves as boundary- breaking advocates of, well, progress as they advocate policies that reject the desiccated notions of the past. This rarely turns out well, as they generally push for more government regulations , spending, and control over the economy. Sometimes, however, they’re on to something — as they work to overturn prohibitionist policies toward cannabis use and drug treatment. It’s an often-told story, but America’s experiment with alcohol Prohibition was a disaster. Yes, alcohol use fell for a while, but it climbed back to existing levels by the end of the national nightmare. In the process, it destroyed businesses, harassed law-abiding citizens, led to a more toxic supply, and energized organized crime. As an aside, Prohibition was a do-gooding progressive policy at the time, although it had the support from religious conservatives (and from the bootleggers , too). Although the use of hard drugs is a troubling social ill, the overall War on Drugs didn’t exactly wipe out the market for heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine. As the great conservative writer William F. Buckley (and his colleagues) pointed out in a 1996 National Review editorial , “It is our judgment that the war on drugs has failed, that it is diverting intelligent energy away from how to deal with the problem of addiction, that it is wasting our resources, and that it is encouraging civil, judicial and penal procedures associated with police states.” That same year, California did in fact lead the way for ending the war on one of the least- harmful drugs, marijuana, via a citizen-approved medical-marijuana initiative ( Proposition 215 ). It created de facto decriminalization, in that one only needed an easily obtained medical card for ailments including stress. In 2016, votes finished the job and legalized recreational cannabis via Proposition 64, although the initiative’s excess regulations and taxes have kept the black market thriving. In the meantime, the state and various left-leaning jurisdictions have approved a variety of “harm-reduction” policies ( needle- exchange programs , greater availability of the overdose-overturning drug, Naloxone, etc.) designed to treat drug addiction more as a public-health problem than a law enforcement/incarceration issue — a sensible approach, at least when dealing with addicted people rather than dealers. Two cheers on that front. “Harm reduction,” the California Department of Public Health explains with regard to our official state policy, “is an approach to working with people who use drugs that aims to reduce harm rather than eliminate risk. Harm reduction means acting in alliance with people who use drugs to offer resources for safer and managed drug use to prevent death, injury, disease, and overdose.” It recognizes what Buckley noted — the futility of trying to arrest drug users and the ill effect of heavy-handed enforcement policies on public budgets and civil liberties. Yet while Gov. Gavin Newsom embraces that approach (along with some justifiable enforcement policies toward those who sell fentanyl) in his new “ Master Plan for Tackling the Fentanyl and Opioid Crisis ,” his administration has rejected harm reduction in an area where it could potentially save tens of thousands of lives, tobacco use. His approach is not that different than the one taken by other blue states, such as Massachusetts and New York. The same harm-reduction principle applies to tobacco use. Many Americans are addicted to nicotine. Nicotine is not the problem per se. The health danger comes from combustion, which is why smoking cigarettes will knock 10 years off a smoker’s life. The prohibitionist approach is to ban tobacco products, but that only creates black markets and the problems found during alcohol Prohibition. The Tax Foundation reports that in New York, which has the nation’s highest cigarette taxes, 55 percent of consumed cigarettes come from smuggled sources. Public Health England, the United Kingdom’s main health agency, has found that vaping is 95 percent safer than smoking combustible cigarettes. Popular nicotine pouches, made from pharmaceutical-grade nicotine (such as Zyn) and snus (its popularity in Sweden is credited for that country’s low tobacco-related cancer rates), are probably even safer. It’s generally best if people avoid such products altogether. But a proper harm-reduction policy would encourage smokers to shift from the most- dangerous products to the least-dangerous ones. Instead, California and other liberal states are doing the opposite. They aren’t banning deadly cigarettes (except for menthol-flavored ones). They are leaving those on the shelves as they impose bans on flavored nicotine products. Because most vapes and pouches use flavors, which are preferred by adults breaking their smoking habit, these bans are dramatically reducing the availability of the safest products. Recent studies from Massachusetts and San Francisco have shown that such bans have led to a rise in combustible cigarette use. My R Street Institute colleague Stacey McKenna has just published a new report that focuses on the counterproductive hypocrisy of blue states (and red states are often hypocritical in reverse) that champion harm reduction with regard to drugs but not tobacco. The five most restrictive states when it comes to tobacco (California, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Jersey) are among the most permissive states when it comes to drugs. “These states’ policies on opioid harm reduction and regulated cannabis markets suggest that their lawmakers understand that even if substances are not 100 percent safe, harm reduction can save lives, and prohibition can create harms,” McKenna wrote . “However, their tight restrictions on ENDS (Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems) products directly contradict this recognition by creating a conflicting prohibitionist environment around tobacco harm reduction that may contribute to a rise in illicit markets and a return to combustible cigarette use.” It’s nonsensical but no doubt stems from the Left’s desire to fight Big Tobacco rather than from any principled or consistent stance in advocating better public health. As a result, these progressives are promoting the most regressive and harmful policies possible — which, when you think about it, shouldn’t surprise anyone who has watched California’s leaders.

"1","I have spent my career in academic science and believe that merit and objectivity are essential guarantors of the scientific enterprise. Boycotts pose the greatest threat. Today, they are being used to target Israel, but, in reality, they are aimed at the heart of science. A recent trip to Israel to confer with fellow academics brings to mind an earlier period and reasons to eschew boycotts. In 2018, I was asked by the Egyptian Fulbright program to review applications from students in biomedical technology seeking to study in the U.S. By itself, this request was not strange, I am a professor of biomedical engineering. But I am also an American Jew who was a Fulbright Scholar in Israel. (READ MORE: Boycotts Aren’t Enough ) I was in Israel shortly after Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood were deposed by coups in Egypt. It was an unstable time there and the U.S. State Department was advising Americans and Jews not to visit. Whatever my feelings about current or past Egyptian governments or their modes of succession, I agreed to review applications. I did so fairly, and to the best of my ability — just as I would have for any organization requesting help in my area(s) of expertise. But given the circumstances, my curiosity was piqued. I subsequently met the director of Fulbright-Israel at an event. I was still curious about the strange request from the Egyptians, whose government is not always favorably disposed to Israelis or Jews. “Not strange at all, Evan,” she replied. “I gave them your name.” The Israeli referred the Egyptians to me because we all belong to one community. The bonds within the Fulbright community are particularly strong. But all scientists belong to a community of scientists and there is an implicit contract between each of us and the whole. The political situation between countries may be fraught, but scientists must be able to call upon their counterparts in other countries for discipline- specific help. Whatever expertise I have achieved, it has come over a lifetime of interactions with other scientists. They mentored me, encouraged me, evaluated me, and challenged me. They have even improved on my work. At least some part of my knowledge and expertise is a communal achievement. I owe it to the community to share it when asked. Scientists in one country or faction cannot withhold their expertise whenever they choose based on personal or political whims. If they do, the entire scientific enterprise collapses. Once scientists and scientific organizations withhold their expertise, memberships, or access to forums, as organized acts of political sabotage, the validity of all science and science-based decision-making is impugned. We descend into the world of Democratic vs. Republican science, White vs. Black science, Gay vs. Straight science. There is sad precedent for this. The Nazis corrupted every profession to achieve dastardly political ends. Many Nazi physicists were complicit. They even denigrated Einstein’s Theory of Relativity as “Jewish Physics.” The Nazi scientists were driven by racial hatred and professional jealousy. Would anyone reasonably expect the rest of their efforts to be untainted? Science derives its power and authority from its objectivity. The weight of a mole of oxygen is fixed, the earth’s gravitational constant is not a matter of political opinion. Findings must be evaluated objectively and duties must be discharged without discrimination. Science and science-based decision-making must be apolitical, lest they be dismissed by large segments of the populace as partisan propaganda. Unfortunately, many scientists in the U.S. and elsewhere are betraying their obligations to our community. They are boycotting their colleagues in Israel. This, despite knowing full well that those Israelis merit consideration and respect. Boycotters are refusing to review manuscripts submitted to journals and refusing to review professional dossiers of Israeli academics awaiting promotion. Scientific societies are denying Israeli academics access to conferences and to professional networks. Like the Nazis before them, many of these boycotts and refusals are driven by ethnic hatred and professional jealousy. But even well-meaning, if naïve, boycotters are risking destruction of the entire scientific enterprise. Boycotts of Israeli or any scientists are anathema to the academic ethos of free exchange of information from all valid sources and objective evaluation of said information. In a world where all science is just another form of political point-scoring, it becomes impossible to “argue based on science.” No more sound reasons to vaccinate children, or stop smoking, or drive the speed limit. Virology, cardiology, and engineering become just matters of politics. Mathematics and physics no longer obey physical laws. No need to curb carbon emissions based on scientific articles claiming the earth is warming. Why should we if journals choose which scientists are getting published according to their politics, religion, or nationality rather than their data and methods? Ergo, all scientific publications are untrustworthy. Welcome to a world of unending conspiracy theories and chaos. (READ MORE: Science Uprising ) Boycotts of scientists undermine the objectivity that is the foundation of a science-based, reason-based, and data-based society. They open the flood gates to all manner of ethnic and racial discrimination. And worse, boycotts that exclude Israeli academics (who hold informed opinions from left to right) deprive us all of knowledgeable and thoughtful perspectives that could help to inform our own views and decisions about Israel and its surrounds. In 2018, neither the Egyptians nor Israelis ever considered letting politics get in the way of their collective desire for qualified and objective evaluations. And neither did I. Evan D Morris, PhD is a Professor of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, and Biomedical Engineering at Yale. In early 2024, he co-organized a mission of 25 Yale academics to Israel to initiate new collaborations with their Israeli colleagues."
"1","F act: New York state Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan, who has issued a gag order to silence former President Donald Trump, has been revealed as the father of a far-left anti-Trump political activist daughter . And allegedly the husband of a one-time staffer for the infamous Trump antagonist, New York Attorney General Letitia James. And the New York State Bar Association closes its eyes. On the face of it, Merchan should recuse himself from Trump’s case. Which, as of this writing, he refuses to do. (RELATED from Jeffrey Lord: MSNBC Throws a Tantrum: Judge Luttig Rages at Trump ) Newsweek magazine has reported the following : Judge Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump on Tuesday, barring him from making public statements about those involved in the case…. According to a June 2022 wedding announcement in Politico, Loren Merchan was the president and partner of Authentic Campaigns, a progressive political consulting firm. The announcement read: “Loren Merchan, president and partner of Authentic Campaigns, and Taylor Harper, geographer at the U.S. Census, got married on Saturday in Moseley, Va. The ceremony was officiated by the bride’s father, New York County Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan.” Authentic Campaigns has listed Vice President Kamala Harris ‘ 2020 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris for the People, the Biden-Harris campaign and Schiff ‘s super Political Action Committee (PAC) as clients. Loren Merchan was also listed as the director of digital persuasion for the Kamala Harris for the People campaign in an archived January 2019 announcement…. According to [her] biography, Merchan has also had other roles in various marketing and communication firms, including Revolution Messaging, Bayard Advertising and Discovery Communications. She worked her way up to vice president of advertising at Revolution Messaging, a progressive political marketing firm. Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett has captured the considerably obvious problem. His headline: The New York Judge Who Gagged Trump Should Recuse Himself Is it any wonder that many Americans have lost confidence in courts of law? Jarrett writes: [Judge] Merchan donated to Trump’s opponent, Joe Biden, and also gave money to an anti-Trump cause, although the amount was small. But the judge’s daughter is also fair game for criticism. Loren Merchan is a public figure who runs a prominent progressive political consulting firm that handles outspoken Trump opponents like Adam Schiff, who was infamously censured by his own colleagues in Congress for peddling endless lies about Trump and the notorious Russia Hoax. Significantly, Merchan’s daughter has a financial or economic interest in her father’s case. She and her clients raised some $93 million in campaign donations by citing the Trump prosecution in their solicitation mailings, according to reporting by The New York Post. On this basis alone, Judge Merchan was obligated to recuse himself because a member of his family —which is identified a child under strict ethical guidelines—has a private, vested interest in the outcome of the case. Yet, he refuses to step aside despite the glaring conflict of interest. Meaning, the fix is in. Bingo. Jarrett has nailed it exactly: “The fix is in.” One of the most amazing things to come out of this massive and decidedly corrupt effort by far-left-wing legal authorities to “Get Trump” is the revelation of the lengths — decidedly unethical lengths — that they will go to accomplish their thoroughly unethical objective. Indeed, Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz has written an entire book on that topic: Get Trump: The Threat to Civil Liberties, Due Process, and Our Constitutional Rule of Law . At this point, Judge Merchan has made himself the poster child for judicial corruption. Knowing — knowing! — that he is both a Biden contributor and the father of a far-left anti-Trump activist, Merchan goes on blithely trying to silence presidential candidate Trump in a massive exercise in election interference. To say the least, someone like this has no business in a judge’s robes. The question now — as with other others in the legal community who have similarly disgraced themselves — is what the various supervisory authorities in New York will do to end this corruption. Where is the New York Bar Association? Amazingly, if not surprisingly, it is sticking with its buddy Judge Merchan. Here is the headline from the association’s website: New York State Bar Association Condemns Threats to the Family of Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan The headline is accompanied by this statement: Richard Lewis, president of the New York State Bar Association, issued the following statement about Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan: “The mission of the New York State Bar Association is to protect the rule of law and to facilitate the administration of justice. That’s why we must condemn in no uncertain terms the unfounded attack on Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan and his family. All judges must be free to decide cases and issue rulings without fear for their safety or that of their family. While they cannot speak out to protect themselves, we can, and we will. Our system of justice depends on it.” Which is to say that the New York State Bar Association will simply close its eyes to the blatant conflict of interest vividly illustrated by Merchan’s corrupt conduct. Got it. Message received. The fix is in. What a disgrace."
"1","T hat Disney has been dying a slow death for a long time should be clear to anyone even remotely familiar with the entertainment industry. Last summer, the company lost $900 million at the box office, and its streaming platform, Disney+, lost 1.3 million subscribers in just the last quarter of 2023. Numbers like these should be easy red flags to stockholders and investors — as should the growing amount of blowback condemning woke content in TV shows and blockbuster films. But they aren’t. Ahead of the annual board meeting on April 3, Disney investors and stockholders cast votes for board directors — all of whom (with one exception) were up for reelection . After spending $40 million in a campaign to convince its own stockholders to vote for the status quo, Disney beat out investor Nelson Peltz (who spent just $19 million but still won 31 percent of the vote). Unfortunately, Disney’s internal political squabbles aren’t irrelevant to the culture. The battle over who should be on the entertainment company’s board was a proxy war over its woke content. ‘Restore the Magic’ at Disney This isn’t the first time Peltz has waged a war on Disney’s board. Last year, Disney CEO Bob Iger was able to stave him off by announcing plans for layoffs and massive cuts. This fall, Peltz announced a new campaign dubbed “Restore the Magic” and nominated two new board members — himself and Jay Rasulo (Disney’s former chief financial officer). Iger wasn’t happy, and the board agreed to spend millions of dollars to campaign among its shareholders and investors. They even sent out mailers featuring favorite Disney characters, including Anna and Elsa from Frozen . Peltz wasn’t the only shareholder trying to infiltrate the board. Blackwells Capital also nominated three new directors, and ValueAct “agreed to back Disney’s board nominees in exchange for sharing information and giving the investor the opportunity to meet with the company,” the Wall Street Journal reports. From one perspective, Peltz’s attempt to change things up at Disney wasn’t a total failure. He may have gotten just 31 percent of the vote, but, as the Telegraph points out, 31 percent is quite high for a man with “no real strategic vision beyond wanting ‘a guy who doesn’t have media experience’ on the board.” Getting Politics Out of the Boardroom Peltz’s fundamental squabble with Disney isn’t necessarily the woke content but instead the company’s ongoing hemorrhage of millions of dollars — but he does see the two as being related. A recent interview with Financial Times reveals Peltz as something of an agnostic when it comes to politics and culture, but an agnostic who has a fair bit of common sense. Peltz is no Republican. He publicly abstained from voting in 2016. Although he did run a fundraiser for Donald Trump in 2020, he then apologized on CNBC after Jan. 6. He’s offered his support from Trump in 2024 , but he’s tepid about it at best — he just doesn’t want Joe Biden in the White House, and Trump is the only other option. When it comes to Disney (or any other company in which the activist investor is involved), Peltz advocates for keeping ideology out of the boardroom. “People go to watch a movie or a show to be entertained,” Peltz told Financial Times when speaking about Disney’s latest Marvel releases, The Marvels and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever . “They don’t go to get a message. Why do I have to have a Marvel that’s all women? Not that I have anything against women, but why do I have to do that? Why can’t I have Marvels that are both? Why do I need an all-black cast?” The 81-year-old multi-billionaire wants to make Disney a profitable company. While Iger has complained that Peltz doesn’t have experience in the entertainment industry, Peltz pointed out that Disney doesn’t seem to be doing so well itself. “They’ve lost first place in animation, they’ve lost first place in features … maybe it’s time to change management in those divisions,” he said . Peltz and his shareholding company, Trian Partners, also own a portion of Unilever, the company that runs Ben & Jerry’s. He’s been critical of the woke direction that company has taken. “You’ve got to get politics out of the board room,” he said, commenting on Ben & Jerry’s recent call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. “Ben & Jerry’s job is to sell ice cream, not to make political statements. And these people use anything for a soap box that they have no right to do.” ‘Can’t Please Everybody’ You might think that Iger would learn his lesson. Peltz may have been nowhere near close to unseating Iger’s control of Disney, but that so many investors voted for an upstart with no plan and little experience in the industry indicates growing discontent with the status quo (never mind the fact that consumers are fleeing Disney for its competitors). But Iger remains as tone-deaf as ever. In dealing with the very credible accusations that Disney is forcing wokeness on unwilling audiences, Iger feigns ignorance. He recently told Deadline : The bottom line is that infusing messaging as a sort of a number one priority in our films and TV shows is not what we’re up to. They need to be entertaining…. [G]enerally speaking, we need to be entertainment for an entertainment first company, and I’ve worked really hard to do that…. It’s not easy, you can’t please everybody all the time, right? Perhaps Iger believes that by denying what’s apparent to everybody, he’ll talk them into returning to theaters. Worse, it’s possible that he’s embraced wokeness so wholeheartedly that he simply doesn’t see it anymore. Either way, Disney had a chance at shaking things up — and it blew it."
"1","F or all its gesticulations about “free speech,” the conservative mainstream often plays a supporting role in America’s censorship regime. It’s a two-step dance: The Right styles itself as the sworn defender of free speech and the mortal enemy of censorship while simultaneously downplaying or outright ignoring brazen censorship of speech that ventures a bit too far outside the Overton window. By claiming to defend all free speech in principle but only defending some in practice, the Right concedes, by omission, that certain ideas fall outside the bounds of free expression — and that it’s perfectly appropriate (or, at least, not particularly objectionable) to bring the full force of regime power to bear against any individual so unwise as to express them. In this sense, the conservative “opposition” to left-wing censorship actually legitimates and perpetuates it. The Right’s silence baptizes the operating premise of the new censorship: That ideas or individuals beyond the rigidly policed boundaries of acceptable opinion have, in effect, forfeited their right to participate in public discourse. The irony, of course, is that the ideas and individuals in question — i.e., those who stray too far to the right — are often the subject of the most vigorous, aggressive, and consistent censorship, both from major tech platforms and the apparatus of the American state. But the so-called far Right tends to be a canary in the coal mine. Invariably, censorship of the right-wing fringe is only ever a pretext for much broader censorship of ideas and figures well within the conservative mainstream. In 2016, the first few rounds of permanent Twitter bans came for figures such as Milo Yiannopoulos and Richard Spencer (as well as Spencer’s think tank and journal). In 2017, the censors graduated to Roger Stone and Andrew Tate ; in 2018, Alex Jones . By 2020, the scope of censorship had expanded to include factual reporting from the New York Post , and, by 2022, comedy from the Babylon Bee . Last November, I wrote a column for the American Conservative criticizing the Right’s response to this phenomenon, in the specific context of social media censorship: Many self-styled free speech advocates will speak about internet censorship in broad terms, while going to great lengths to avoid saying the names of the most frequent subjects of that censorship, for fear of being accused of harboring ideological sympathy for the far-right. But that fear represents its own kind of capitulation; by implicitly accepting ideological limits to the free speech we’ll defend, we accept the very framework that enables and justifies censorship in the first place. It’s impossible to fight censorship if you refuse to specify the instances in which it occurs. Free speech belongs to all of us. The same could be said of the remarkable silence from conservative media outlets and pundits regarding VDARE , a prominent right-wing anti-immigration outlet. VDARE, which was founded in 1999, expresses views on race and immigration that often veer beyond the limits of acceptable opinion in modern America. As a result, New York Attorney General Letitia James has taken it upon herself to crush the outlet altogether, using the flimsy pretext of nonprofit law. (James’ appetite for lawfare has apparently only grown since she launched her campaign against Former President Donald Trump.) “VDARE has not been charged with any crime,” Christopher Brunet noted in the American Conservative earlier this week. But “[a]fter years of aimless fishing expeditions, what James has latched onto is VDARE’s real estate dealings,” revolving around a $1.4 million castle in West Virginia that VDARE purchased “to use as a conference space because hotels kept canceling their meetings.” Brunet continues: As part of this investigation, Letitia James is demanding that VDARE hand over 40 gigabytes of emails which [could reveal VDARE’s anonymous donors and writers]. VDARE’s donors and writers wish to remain anonymous because they will lose their jobs—or worse—if their identities are linked to what they support online. While the court has ostensibly extended a courtesy by permitting VDARE to redact their names from these emails, the estimated fees for such redactions are projected to come to $150,000. This presents VDARE with a stark dilemma: incur a hefty $150,000 expense to protect the anonymity of its donors and writers, or risk revealing their identities. The lesson here is that if your speech falls outside the Overton window, the state of New York will aggressively attempt to bankrupt and/or doxx you. The latest development in this scandal came on March 27, when VDARE was held “in Contempt of Court because we have not yet complied (because we were fighting it) with [James’] January 23, 2023 order that we meet NYAG James’ massive and crippling subpoena demands,” Peter Brimelow, VDARE’s founder and editor, wrote last week. “We have fought NYAG Letitia James, at a cost of up to $1 million, for nearly three years. But now we are literally hanging on the cross.” VDARE has been the subject of a sustained campaign of harassment from powerful left-wing groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center, which went so far as to send activists to badger the residents of the small, 750-person West Virginia town where the outlet is based. Now, those activists and their allies in the governments of states like New York appear to have found their opening — and intend to take down every American who ever donated to, or wrote for, VDARE in the process. (After James’ office got ahold of Nikki Haley’s donor list in 2022, the list — “bearing a stamp from James’ office” — was mysteriously leaked to the media. One can only imagine whose hands the list of VDARE donors would accidentally fall into.) L’affaire de VDARE has broad implications across any number of different issues: free speech and censorship, the unholy marriage — and subsequent weaponization — of public and private power, the limits of reasonable debate surrounding topics like immigration and race, and the use of nonprofit law to crush the speech of political dissidents. (It’s notable that the case against VDARE is being spearheaded by Rick Sawyer, New York’s “Special Counsel for Hate Crimes,” rather than anyone in the office’s charities bureau.) But at its heart, it’s a straightforward issue of basic and essential constitutional rights. If conservatives can’t be expected to defend those , then they can’t be expected to defend much of anything at all."
"1","A s each day passed without a verdict, Rebecca Lavrenz and her family were beginning to think that Rebecca just might make history. No D.C. jury had yet to acquit a Jan. 6 defendant . Late on Thursday, April 4, the third day of deliberation, those hopes were dashed. Rebecca was convicted on all four counts. Rebecca Lavrenz is among the 10 women I profile in my forthcoming book, Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 . What attracted me to Rebecca’s story is that she is a great-grandmother — a “praying great- grandmother,” as she describes herself. On New Year ’ s Day 2021, Rebecca got a call from her son asking if she intended to attend the “March to Save America” rally in Washington. Knowing his mom refused to fly because of mandatory masking, he hinted: “ You know it ’ s only a 25-hour drive. You can make it in two days.” Rebecca prayed about it and came to the conclusion: “ You know what, I think God ’ s telling me to go.” And so she went, stopping in St. Louis for a single overnight stay. At approximately 2:43 p.m. on Jan. 6, Rebecca entered the Capitol through an open door on the more orderly east side of the Capitol. Said Rebecca, “ I felt that if those doors opened I was supposed to go through.” After entering, engulfed in a crowd, she ascended the east stairs and headed toward the Rotunda. She didn ’ t yell, didn ’ t shout, spoke to one police officer about nothing memorable, and saw no violence or vandalism. Although no one told her to leave, at 2:51 p.m. she climbed down the stairs she had just ascended and exited the building. J. Edgar would be rolling over in his grave if he knew his beloved agents were tracking down great-grannies on misdemeanor charges, but that’s apparently the FBI’s new mission. On April 19, 2021, Patriots Day, the bureau came calling on Rebecca. Hearing a knock on the door of her semi-rural Colorado home, she opened it to find a male and a female agent who had come to investigate. “ I ’ m sorry,” said Rebecca, “ I ’ m in the middle of baking a cake for my son ’ s birthday.” She asked if they could reschedule their visit. To her surprise, they agreed and returned on April 26 for a “ consensual interview.” In the rush to round up “insurrectionists,” the FBI failed to devise a standard protocol for arresting suspects. One of the women I profile in Ashli , Dr. Simone Gold, got the full, 20-agent, battering ram treatment for a single misdemeanor. “ They arrested me,” Gold told Tucker Carlson . “ They [yell], ‘P ut your hands up, put your hands up, face the wall, face the wall ’; they ’ re screaming, ‘F ace the wall’ — handcuffed, shackled, take me downtown, orange suit, strip search, holding cell, fluorescent lights — it was terrible — no phone call, no Miranda rights.” In Gold’s Los Angeles, the neighbors would have applauded. In conservative Colorado Springs, a little more circumspection was in order. A few months after the interview, Rebecca heard back from the agents. They told her she had reason to be glad: She was only going to be charged with four misdemeanors. “ Glad?” said Rebecca. “ I shouldn ’ t be charged with anything.” (READ MORE from Jack Cashill: George Floyd Revisited: Derek Chauvin Was Wrongfully Convicted ) On March 25, 2024, Rebecca finally went to trial before Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. She was charged with the same four misdemeanors as were many, perhaps most, of the 1,300 or so protestors arrested on Jan. 6: entering and remaining in a restricted building; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds; disorderly conduct in a capitol building; parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a capitol. I attended the trial on May 26. By that time, the jury had been selected and seated. Eight of the 14, including two alternates, were white. Eight were female. As one of Rebecca’s hard-boiled attorneys told me, “ The government strikes anyone who seems normal.” The common denominator among them seemed to be boredom. When the prosecutors elicited from a squat, female Capitol Police officer that she feared for her life, the jurors looked nonplussed. Living in a city whose media are geared to please the 95 percent of its audience that voted against Donald Trump, they had heard it all before. I suspect, too, that Rebecca disappointed them. Human nature being what it is, they were likely hoping for some fire-breathing Proud Boy or Oath Keeper, a trophy perp whose conviction they could dine out on until Armageddon. Instead, they got the attractive, well-turned-out winner of the congeniality prize in the Miss Iowa contest a half century prior. That evening, Laura and her two daughters visited “Freedom Corner,” a secluded spot wedged between the D.C. jail and the Congressional Cemetery. At 7:30 each evening for the last 600 or so nights, protesters have gathered there to remind the Jan. 6 prisoners inside the jail that they have not been forgotten. If the protest group has a leader, it is Micki Witthoeft, the plain-spoken, no-nonsense mother of Ashli Babbitt , the U.S. Air Force veteran shot to death inside the Capitol on Jan. 6. At 9 p.m. the protesters joined the prisoners via telephone to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner,” patriotism at its purest and rawest. After the anthem, Rebecca and her daughters headed out to prepare for the next day. On Day 6, a Monday, Rebecca took to the witness stand in her own defense, wearing, says daughter Laura, “her beautiful yellow dress and blue high heels.” She remained on the stand throughout the morning and into the afternoon. “ This past week you ’ ve seen videos of what I look like on the outside,” she told the jury, “but now, I hope you get to see my heart.” Under questioning from her attorney, Rebecca described how she accepted God into her life as a teenager, met her future husband in high school, married him when he came back from Vietnam, and gave birth to four children. She now has seven grandchildren and one great- grandchild. Rebecca Lavrenz and writer Jack Cashill (Jack Cashill/The American Spectator) Rebecca talked at some length about her affection for the U.S. Constitution and her felt need to stand up for it. At one point, her attorney showed an image of Rebecca facing the crowd, her back to the Capitol doors. When asked what she was thinking at the moment, Rebecca choked back her tears to say, “I am standing here representing millions of other people who also love our country but couldn ’ t be here with me.” The three young prosecutors — all thin, white, and bespectacled — evoked Hannah Arendt’s immortal phrase “the banality of evil.” Arendt made that comment in reference to Nazi executioner-in-chief Adolf Eichmann. The prosecutors had not ascended to that level of evil, but in their untroubled eagerness to send a prayerful great- grandmother to prison, they seemed capable. When badgered, Rebecca retreated to her firmly held belief: “ It was my First Amendment Right to be seen and heard. I wanted my presence to be known.” On Tuesday morning, Day 7, the jury received its instructions and began deliberating. At the end of the day, they still had not reached a verdict. This was encouraging. The jury took less than four hours to convict Guy Reffitt, the first Jan. 6 defendant to seek a trial by jury. Although Reffitt did not go into the Capitol, he was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for helping to “ignite the crowd.” His adolescent son turned him in. His wife Nicole attends the nightly vigil at Freedom Corner. She still wonders why the much more visible “igniter” of crowds, Ray Epps, received no jail time at all. On Wednesday, Day 8, the jury remained in deliberation for the entire day. “This means someone on that jury is obviously fighting for me,” Rebecca posted at day’s end, “and to me that means God is making tremendous power available through the fervent, heartfelt, continued prayers of you, His saints.” It seems likely that the other jurors finally wore that “someone” down. Sentencing to come. Jack Cashill’s newest book, Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 , will be released this summer. On sale now is his book Untenable: The True Story of White Ethnic Flight from America’s Cities ."

We have stayed in touch and done at least one event together for Claremont since that time. Unfortunately, since the 2020 presidential election, John has been put through the wringer more than just about anyone in American public life. He was forced to retire from the law school where he was a longtime constitutional law professor and even dean. He was let go by the University of Colorado’s Benson Center for Western Civilization, where he was a visiting scholar. Armed Stasi — sorry, FBI — agents accosted him in a parking lot and seized his phone without a warrant. He has been suspended from academic conferences and lost board seats. He and his wife have endured death threats, spikes in their driveway, and threatening graffiti in their neighborhood. He has been debanked by Bank of America and the USAA. He is being criminally prosecuted by scandal-ridden Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis. And last week, State Bar Court of California Judge Yvette Roland devoted 128 pages to explaining why he should lose his law license. All this because John had the chutzpah to do what every law school student is taught to do in legal ethics class: defend and zealously advocate for one’s client, no matter how unpopular, or even disreputable that client may be. In this case, John’s unpopular client was a high-profile one: former President Donald Trump. There has been an astronomical amount of misinformation about John’s activities in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol jamboree, as well as the legal advice that he offered his high-profile client during that time. The corporate media and the Democrat- lawfare complex typically speak of John’s legal advice as encouraging the “overturning of an election” or “fomenting an insurrection,” but such hyperbolic talk is irresponsible and wildly off base. John acquitted himself well in a compelling essay he penned for Claremont’s American Mind online journal on Jan. 18, 2021, titled “Setting the Record Straight on the POTUS ‘Ask.'” His 12th Amendment argument about the vice president’s more active role in certifying the states’ slates of electors and his accompanying argument regarding the constitutional dubiousness of the Electoral Count of 1887 might not be correct (although it could be), but it is well within the bound of plausible, nonfrivolous legal argumentation an attorney can (indeed, should ) press upon an embattled client. That is doubly so here, because the U.S. Supreme Court has never authoritatively interpreted the relevant 12th Amendment provision. Countless legal arguments more frivolous than this are advanced every day in courtrooms across America. Nor is John Eastman the only man being prosecuted, and possibly disbarred, for his legal activity after the 2020 election. Former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark is also being prosecuted in Georgia, and he was just found by the District of Columbia Bar to have violated an ethics rule, which might lead to his own disbarment there — all stemming from an internal Department of Justice memo that Clark never even sent. Once upon a time, the American Left understood the moral imperative of ensuring that all Americans have adequate access to legal representation, no matter one’s popularity in the eyes of the government or societal elites. Indeed, the definitive American example of such unpopular legal representation actually dates back to before the United States was even independent: In 1770, a young lawyer named John Adams, the man who would become the young republic’s second president, took it upon himself to defend the British soldiers accused of killing five colonists at the Boston Massacre. Years later, in his dotage, Adams reflected that this was “one of the most gallant, generous, manly and disinterested actions of my whole life, and one of the best pieces of service I ever rendered my country.” Presumably, Fani Willis and Judge Roland would have preferred to see John Adams tarred and feathered for his treachery. One also cannot help but wonder how they might have viewed the NAACP’s legal representation in the Deep South during the days of Jim Crow. The ultimate aim of those Jacobins prosecuting and disbarring lawyers for having the temerity to practice the legal profession is clear: the subordination of the rule of law to the Jacobins’ own friend/enemy-level politics, and the cowing into submission of those lawyers who would so much as consider representing a high-profile Republican client or work in a Republican Department of Justice. Ironically, and without any hint of self-awareness, they do all this in the name of “our democracy.” To find out more about Josh Hammer and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at www.creators.com .

"1","“Y oung people are the future” is a quip every Gen Zer has heard. Unfortunately, the “future” has lost its interest in the future. Young people are increasingly turning their backs on marriage and children, a choice that is hurting their mental and spiritual health, their physical wellbeing, and, ultimately, their happiness and sense of fulfillment with life. As I approach graduation from college, I also approach my second wedding anniversary. Unfortunately, my husband’s and my young marriage is far from the norm in today’s society, and these new norms are hurting America’s young people. Devaluing Marriage The institute of marriage has been undermined in our post- feminist society, and rates have been steadily decreasing since 1980 . In 1980, only 6 percent of men and women over 40 had never been married; by 2021, that number had more than tripled to 25 percent. Today, the United States is experiencing record-low rates of marriage. Marrying young has become particularly rare. According to Art of Manliness , “In 1960, the median age for first marriage was 23 for men and 20 for women.” Now, it’s 30 and 28 , respectively. That said, according to Susan Brown , a sociology professor at Bowling Green State University, marriages today are “much more stable” than they were in 1979, the year the divorce rate “peaked.” “ We’re seeing a tremendous drop in divorce among young adults in their 20s and through their 30s,” Brown told NPR . “ 1 in 10 people getting divorced today [are] over the age of 65.” This is likely due to the fact that as overall marriage rates decrease, the majority of marriages become those between men and women with a strong religious background, and these individuals are the least likely to get divorced, as Brown points out . They are also more likely to get married young, and so, instead of attempting to fuse together two very different lives, the husband and wife grow and mature together, building one unified life. Unfortunately, even though many young people still want to get married, they no longer believe it to be important for a happy life. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center study , “Among all adults ages 18 to 34, 20% say being married is extremely or very important for people to live a fulfilling life, and 22% say having children is extremely or very important.” Instead, they value careers and friends. Hurting Our Youth In addition to deemphasizing the importance of marriage, today’s secular culture goes so far as to claim that the sexual freedom today’s youth experience outside of marriage has made them happier. “There’s less responsibility for meeting the needs of a spouse, and coordinating living together and reducing conflict,” psychology professor Charles T. Hill told the Knot , a popular marriage and dating website. “Plus, there’s less responsibility for raising any children that may result. Those who are single have more freedom to do what they want when they want … or to play the field without commitments.” This argument, however, has been proven false. Not only are married couples more likely to be overall happier, but they also, according to Harvard Medical School, “tend to live longer,” “have fewer strokes and heart attacks,” and avoid cancer and chronic diseases . In addition, married couples are more likely to avoid poverty, become financially prosperous, and achieve success in their careers. In contrast, as marriage rates have decreased, the percentage of American adults struggling with depression has drastically increased, a 2023 study from Gallup found. Adults aged 18 to 29 have the highest rates of current depression or treatment for depression, while those aged 18 to 44 have the fastest-rising increases in diagnosis of the illness. Women have been especially affected. Nearly one third will be diagnosed with depression at some point in their lives, compared to only 20 percent of men. “The gap between the married and the unmarried in terms of financial resources, health and well-being is growing,” said Brown. Relationships as a ‘Business’ Transaction Daily Wire host Michael Knowles recently had a viral exchange with a feminist in which they argued over the benefits of marriage. Knowles pushed back on the post-modern idea that “independence” is the ultimate good. “I don’t want to be independent,” Knowles said. “I want to be dependent on my wife.” Yet independence is all the rage in today’s dating culture. Technology has directly impacted that development, with “ 28 percent of all to-be-weds” choosing to opt out of forming connections in the real world and instead “swiping, vetting and engaging with potential partners online,” the Knot explains. Unfortunately, this technological approach has skewed our view of dating. A recent article from NBC News may proclaim that “dating coaches” are promoting “more traditional dating roles,” but those same coaches argue that young people should “see the dating scene and relationships as a business.” A TikTok influencer featured in the article echoed that sentiment, telling her more than 1 million subscribers to “only date men [who] can afford you.” This modern view of dating and marriage is preventing the formation of real, flourishing relationships. Marriage is not about what each spouse can get out of it; it’s about building a life together for the happiness of the other, the wellbeing of their children, and — ultimately — union with God. Young people will only succeed in being the future if they are taught the value and beauty of marriage. If they aren’t, America’s cultural decay will see no end."
"1","T he Trump campaign juxtaposed an empty podium bearing the words “Anytime, Anywhere, Anyplace” with its candidate on the other side of the stage delivering a full-throated address earlier this week. “That’s for Joe Biden,” Trump told the Green Bay crowd of the empty podium. “I’m trying to get him to debate, I’m calling on ‘Crooked Joe’ to debate anytime, anyplace. We’ll do it anywhere you want, Joe, so that we can discuss in a friendly manner the real problems of the country, of which there are many, instead of trying to have corrupt prosecutors fight your battles for you.” The debate about debates, like discussions over the candidates’ cognitive health and the legal issues surrounding Trump and the Bidens, demonstrates the genius of politicians in presenting the sideshow as the circus. Such issues do not persuade voters about the worth of the candidate’s proposed policies and general philosophy. They largely distract from the main issues facing the next president. The national debt approaches $35 trillion, war overwhelms Haiti, Israel, Ukraine, and points beyond, and illegal immigrants overwhelm the southern border. Yet, the political discussion fixates on personalities, courtroom drama, and process issues that do not illustrate the governing philosophies of either major candidate. Ironically, debates, the forum that often illuminates the plans and outlooks of candidates, move in our centering-of-the-sideshow politics out from under the big tent into the domain of bearded ladies and sword swallowers. It seems unlikely Joe Biden and Donald Trump face each other on a stage. It seems very likely that debates about a theoretical debate permeate the national discussion from now until the fall. This latter type of debate makes everyone dumber. Why no debate? Democrat Katie Hobbs chickened out of a debate with Republican Kari Lake in 2022’s Arizona governor’s race. Despite trailing in the polls and looking cowardly for refusing to debate, Hobbs won the election. The voters rewarded, or at least did not care to punish, weakling behavior. The president’s team undoubtedly noticed. The Hobbs example provides Biden the rationale for why debating Trump does not make sense. And incumbents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon did not debate their opponents. They won two of the greatest landslides in presidential history. The plethora of somewhat credible third-party candidates — everyone knows Robert Kennedy, Jr., Cornell West, and, by this point, Jill Stein, and the Libertarian Party usually garners more votes than other alternative parties — sets up innumerable controversies that practically invite the president to withdraw. One, probably RFK, Jr., possibly passes the stated thresholds for winning a place on the debate stage. Recall Jimmy Carter’s refusal to share the stage with independent John Anderson in 1980 that resulted in a single debate between the president and Ronald Reagan instead of the planned three. When asked last month whether he would debate, the president said, “[I]t depends on his behavior.” Americans remember Trump’s behavior — then the nadir of his short career as a politician — during the first 2020 presidential debate. Even Republicans watching felt flashbacks to annoying people from their pasts who incessantly interrupted and operated as though the rules did not apply. Biden’s people undoubtedly feel that 2020 catastrophic performance — possibly catalyzed by undiagnosed COVID shortly thereafter revealed in Trump — provides an excuse for not debating in 2024. Alas, Biden debated Trump four weeks later, which undermines any current argument against debating that rests on the September 29, 2020, televised disaster. At 82, Biden gives the White House staff fits even when taking questions from the press. Sage Steele’s revelation that ESPN executives scripted questions for her 2021 interview with Biden buttresses this presidency-with-the-bumper-rails-up mindset. So, too, did last year’s scandal of Biden holding a card with a Los Angeles Times reporter’s name, picture, and the question she subsequently asked. If Joe Biden’s handlers cannot control the environment, then the president stays far away. And no environment appears so unpredictable as one featuring Donald J. Trump. To protect the president from any backlash from skipping this passage rite to the presidency, booster journalists propel a narrative that such unconventional behavior necessarily excommunicates Trump from the sacredness of the debate stage — that place where Al Gore invaded George W. Bush’s personal space, Bernie Shaw asked about the hypothetical rape and murder of Kitty Dukakis, and Gerald Ford denied Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. “Presidential debates are for candidates who know how to conduct themselves in public, and who’ve earned the right to be on the stage,” Steve Benen of MSNBC maintains . “Trump falls short on both counts.” Actually, he does not. He won the nomination of a 170-year-old party, appears on the ballot in all 50 states, and leads narrowly in most polls. And the question regarding whether he earned the right to debate misses the point. The real question: Have the voters earned the right to see the candidates whose names appear on their ballots debate on a stage before they make their choice? Neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump debated their primary opponents. It seems rich for Trump now or Biden later if he trails to demand what they failed to give prior to securing the nomination. It nevertheless amounts to an injustice for either man to dodge this fairly consistent (recently at least) quadrennial fall tradition. Civic-minded groups did not draw up the idea of presidential debates, after all, to serve this or that candidate. They wished to serve the voters. And just as the absence of serious debate about how the Fed unnaturally suppressing interest rates brought about inflation or the role of welfare programs in attracting a substantial chunk of Central and South America to relocate in the United States does not serve the American people, the absence of actual debates between the major presidential candidates does not serve them, either. It insults them.

"1","Y es, Joe Deadhorse is my nickname for Joe Biden, as those among our readers who have been checking in each weekend for the installments of the serializing, soon-to-be-bestselling novel King of the Jungle , well know. He’s Joe Deadhorse because everything about him is akin to a dead horse. He represents a politics in America that is ready for the glue factory. Biden isn’t even an active ingredient in his own administration. He’s told what to do by an unseen cabal of handlers who quite obviously owe far more allegiance to Barack Obama, the real boss, than they do to the demented old man and his batty AWFL wife in the White House. And, as terrible as that may sound, it’s actually better than giving Biden the reins of power. No, really. As hard as it is to say that we’re better off with Susan Rice and Anita Dunn calling the shots on Obama’s behalf and putting Biden out there to take the blame for everything than letting Biden himself make these calls, it’s probably true. But here’s the problem: everybody knows that none of this works. Everybody knows. Team Biden, which is Team Obama, knows. They don’t want to admit it, of course, because to do so would be to put their political power — the all- important source of meaning in their lives — at risk. I keep saying this, but that dynamic is where the danger truly lies this year. 1\. Look Who’s Saying the Polls Don’t Matter There was a Wall Street Journal poll that came out a few days ago that had Donald Trump beating Biden in six of the seven swing states, with the two tied in Wisconsin, at least in a head-to-head contest: Republican Donald Trump leads President Joe Biden in six battleground states in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, according to a Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday that cited concerns about the economy and Biden’s performance. Trump garnered a lead of between 2 and 8 percentage points among voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina on a ballot that included third-party and independent candidates, the Journal said. The results were similar in a one-on-one matchup with Biden, it said. In Wisconsin, a seventh state where the contest is expected to be close, Biden was ahead by 3 points on a multiple candidate ballot and tied in a head-to- head contest with Trump, the Journal said… Trump was viewed as having the better physical and mental fitness for the job by 48% of respondents, compared to 28% for Biden, the poll showed. Oh, but no , says DOCTOR Jill Biden: To heck with the polls — Jill Biden says it’s “obvious” she will get a second term as first lady. Mrs. Biden dismissed some discouraging poll numbers in an interview this week on “CBS Mornings” and said President Biden is surging and will win in November. Co-host Tony Dokoupil noted a Wall Street Journal poll showing former President Donald Trump leading in all but one of seven key battleground states, which Mrs. Biden dismissed. “No, he’s not losing in all the battleground states. He is coming up, and he’s even or doing better,” she stated. Mrs. Biden then confidently stated the “obvious.” “You know what? Once people start to focus in and they see their two choices, it’s obvious that Joe will win this election,” she said. The Wall Street Journal poll referenced by Mr. Dokoupil had Mr. Trump leading in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina by margins of 2-8 percentage points. Mr. Biden had only a 3-point lead in Wisconsin among the seven key states surveyed. If those results held, Mr. Trump would have about 310 Electoral College votes, comfortably more than the 270 needed to win. I’m not here to tell you that you should have any sort of slavish adherence to poll numbers. I won’t do that at all. What I will say is that when you start denying that polls matter, or that “the polls” can’t be believed, it’s a good sign you’re losing. And whether Jill Biden, America’s most famous AWFL, believes it or not, that’s what’s going on with Team Biden. Clearly they’re losing. Just ask Rasmussen , who now has Trump with an eight-point lead on Biden nationally. (By the way, in case you’re confused, AWFL stands for Affluent White Female Leftist, though sometimes the word “liberal” is used instead as the “L.” And yes, Jill Biden is as good an avatar for those as there is, though I won’t fuss at you if you throw Liz Warren or Randi Weingarten in as the better avatar of the species.) 2\. But Why Is This Happening to Poor Joe Deadhorse? I’m glad you asked because now I can sit back and let John McLaughlin, who served as Trump’s pollster in 2020, explain it. This is from a Newsmax column that John and Jim McLaughlin co-authored a couple of weeks ago, but all of McLaughlin’s observations are still spot on: Many Americans believe the country is becoming a virtual dictatorship with a solid majority saying President Joe Biden wants to put former President Donald Trump in jail to stop his electoral chances, a new McLaughlin poll finds. We should note that Russian President Vladimir Putin just won reelection by 88%. But he did so only after Putin first jailed his leading political opponent, Alexei Navalny, and many of his supporters. (Sadly, Navalny recently died while in prison.) Now Biden’s playbook against Trump seems eerily similar. At least a majority of American voters think so. In our new national poll 56% of all voters think Biden really wants to stop Trump from winning by putting him in jail. The national poll of 1,000 likely voters with plus or minus 3.1% at the 95% confidence interval was completed between March 9 and March 14. Only 30% say it’s not true that Biden is trying to jail Trump. Here are some eye-popping findings from the McLaughlins in that survey: 67% say that politics has played a role in the indictments of Trump. 58% say that Biden has played a role in the indictments of Trump. 56% to 31% say there is a double standard and bias at Biden’s Department of Justice, FBI, and IRS, where they target Trump but Biden and his family get sweetheart deals. 52% to 38% say the indictments against Trump were done because he leads in the polls and they want him stopped. 58% to 34% say that Biden should stop targeting Trump and interfering in the election, letting voters decide the next president. 3\. Hey, Think This Will Work To Fix Those Poll Problems? There’s a survey out there that says most Americans have turned against Israel’s continued prosecution of the war against Hamas, though it’s a little bit of an outlier. But maybe Team Biden doesn’t think so. They’re using that incident a few days ago in which seven aid workers were killed in what sounds like a mistaken air strike by the IDF as the justification for a demand for an immediate cessation of hostilities. That was Joe Deadhorse’s message to Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone call on Thursday: President Biden spoke by telephone with Prime Minister Netanyahu. The two leaders discussed the situation in Gaza. President Biden emphasized that the strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation are unacceptable. He made clear the need for Israel to announce and implement a series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers. He made clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel’s immediate action on these steps. He underscored that an immediate ceasefire is essential to stabilize and improve the humanitarian situation and protect innocent civilians, and he urged the Prime Minister to empower his negotiators to conclude a deal without delay to bring the hostages home. The two leaders also discussed public Iranian threats against Israel and the Israeli people. President Biden made clear that the United States strongly supports Israel in the face of those threats. So much for that pledge of eternal support for Israel after the horrors of Oct. 7, you guys. Poor John Kirby, who seems like he’s very sad to have to explain away the various idiocies of the people he works for (unlike Karine Jean-Pierre, who is far more grateful for her DEI job assignment and is willing to shill for Team Biden with far less conscience), didn’t seem to have much fun in trying to make sense of this: It’s hard to conjure up much sympathy for Kirby. If he had any pride or principle, he would have blown that pop stand some time ago. And just to make it all the clearer why the American people keep expressing a classic meme attitude toward Team Biden, there is: 4\. Hey, Let’s Insist on Ukraine Joining NATO! Tony Blinken should have been impeached as secretary of state several times by now, starting with the revelations that he was one of the people behind ginning up those 50 intelligence community spooks who outright lied to the American people by declaring the Hunter Biden laptop reporting was a Russian disinformation plot. Blinken’s role in the Afghanistan pullout, which by the way has given us the wonderful everything-old-is-new- again phenomenon of ISIS-K training bases in Afghanistan, was another reason. There have been a few others. And now there’s this : U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that Ukraine will eventually join NATO as support for the country remains “rock solid” among member states. “Ukraine will become a member of NATO. Our purpose at the summit is to help build a bridge to that membership,” Blinken told reporters in Brussels. Is he crazy? Is he stupid? One poll question this column would be interested to see results from is very simple: “Should the U.S. be engaged in encouraging talks to reach a ceasefire or a lasting peace in the Ukraine war?” If that isn’t a 2-to-1 winner among the American people, it would be a bit of a surprise. But here’s the thing: continuing to demand that Ukraine be made a member of NATO when that is the single worst irritant when it comes to Russia’s relations with the West is the best possible way to ensure that no peace talks will be had between the Russians and Ukrainians. And we already know that this government has kiboshed any opportunities for peace talks over the last two-plus years. So Israel, who was invaded, can’t be allowed to win when they can, and Ukraine, who was invaded, can’t be allowed to find peace when winning is no longer a real possibility. This is your foreign policy. It’s just one of a smorgasbord of reasons why the American people are souring on Joe Deadhorse. The stench is a lot more powerful than the political corpse is, that’s for sure. 5\. Bingle Update I’ve had a smattering of messages from a few of you asking after Mr. Bingle, who is this fella… I know, right? That’s the kind of face you can’t help but root for, isn’t it? I’d had a column in this space a good while ago talking about Bingle’s health issues — specifically that he has a growth of some kind that has turned his epiglottis into, essentially, a giant rock in his throat. At the time I wrote it, the vet was giving me the “enjoy what time you’ve got left” speech because the way he saw it, Bingle was a goner with that sort of malady. So I figured I should pay the little guy a tribute in these pages. That was in January of last year. It’s now 15 months later — where did the time go? — and would you believe Bingle is as vibrant and robust as ever? No, that thing on his epiglottis hasn’t gone away. It hasn’t gotten any bigger, either, which is good. But none of the effects the vet was certain would happen — that he wouldn’t be able to eat, or that he’d aspirate, or that his breathing would be impaired — have happened. Now, he coughs like one of those old guys playing chess in the park. And when this dog begins snoring, it literally sounds like a chainsaw. I’ve got to do podcast appearances all the time, including with The Spectacle , and Bingle gets shooed out of my office because he will nod off to sleep in the doggie bed in the corner and practically drown me out with the snoring. That’s a function of the rock in his throat. But otherwise? He had to go to the vet last week for his yearly shots, and the guy was beside himself. “How are you keeping this dog in such good shape?” All I can say is I took him off kibble and now he eats the FreshPet dog food, plus I give him this supplement from a company called Petsmont. It’s essentially a mushroom powder that apparently does wonders to reduce lumps and tumors and so forth; it seems to work. And anyway, Bingle has made me look like an overreacting, wolf-crying helicopter parent for having written that column all those months ago because, to answer your questions, he’s doing absolutely, miraculously great. So far. We’ll keep enjoying each day as an unexpected blessing anyway, even if that snoring has cut down on my REM sleep."
"2","As the moon passes in front of the sun on April 8, its shadow will knock down solar power production in a sweeping band across the United States from Texas to Maine, home to more than 31 million people . The United States currently has more than 139 gigawatts of solar electricity generation capacity . That’s more than two and a half times the amount of solar that was on the grid during the last total eclipse in 2017 . The upcoming eclipse will also shade a path twice as wide as the last one. Though much of the country will see some decline in solar power production, the biggest decrease will be directly under the moon’s shadow. For the most part, power grid operators aren’t too worried about outages or major problems during the eclipse. In fact, unlike disruptions like clouds, the moon passing between the Earth and the sun is easily predictable up to 1,000 years in advance . But behind the scenes, it will require a carefully choreographed series of energy transactions to precisely ramp up electricity from a handful of generators and route it across hundreds of miles of transmission lines to millions of customers to precisely match the needs of every monitor, air conditioner, and light bulb the instant they turn on. So grid operators are preparing for the totality, and the lessons they learn will prove useful as even more intermittent power sources connect to the grid and as power generators and transmission systems face even more severe stresses from rising energy demand and threats like wildfires , drought , and storms, many worsened by climate change . Texas is a case in point. It has the second-largest solar capacity in the US and the path of totality cuts straight through it. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the US will see a nearly 60 gigawatt drop in solar power production when the moon blocks out the lone star in the sky above the Lone Star State. The Texas grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), has been running simulations and modeling how the eclipse will affect the state’s power network, which, unlike the rest of the continental US, has few connections to other states. That means it can’t easily buy or sell electricity across state lines if it has too much or too little power. Hail storms last month also caused major damage to some solar installations in the state. For power grids like ERCOT’s, the biggest challenge is how quickly solar power will fall off and bounce back up. The eclipse will cause solar power generation to fall and rise at a faster rate than a typical sunset and sunrise. The big questions about solar eclipses Why is this year’s event different? What are eclipse chasers? How to protect your eyes What is the economic impact? What makes eclipses thrilling to watch? When is the next one? “ERCOT has analyzed the ramping challenges posed by the eclipse and will continue to monitor this aspect of the eclipse as updated weather forecasts are received,” said a spokesperson for ERCOT in an email. Farther north, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which runs power transmission across much of the Midwest, is also bracing for a sudden drop and spike in solar energy production, which could cause congestion, a situation in which more electricity is available than can be delivered. Operators also anticipate that temperatures will drop somewhat during the eclipse, which could lower cooling demand but increase the need for lighting. In response, operators are bringing more reserve power online and coordinating electricity deliveries with neighboring grids. A slide from a MISO planning document showing how the grid is preparing for the solar eclipse. MISO Why is it so tricky to keep the lights on when it gets dark during the day? The main issue is that electricity generation has to closely match demand for it. If there’s too little power, that can lead to brownouts and blackouts. If there’s more electricity than anyone can easily use, it means the utility is wasting money. Excess power can also lead to equipment failures or destabilize the network . “If there’s a change on either side — the generation or on the load side — some control actions are needed to balance it, and it has to be done quite quickly,” said Adam Birchfield , an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Texas A&M; University who studies the power grid. “Typically, that is some kind of traditional generator, whether it’s natural gas , coal, or hydro, that can adjust its output slightly to make up for that difference.” One way to do this is with “ spinning reserve .” That’s where a power generator is already spinning and synchronized with the power grid, but not connected until it is needed. Another way is with dedicated power plants that spool up to meet demand spikes. These are called peaking power plants and they are usually powered by natural gas. Energy storage with pumped hydropower or grid batteries can also kick in, but there aren’t that many of these storage systems right now, certainly not on the scales needed to balance the entire power grid. Like airline tickets, the longer you wait to book your electricity, the more expensive it gets. And if you’re too late, there may not be enough power to go around. Grid operators and utilities thus try to buy power as far ahead as possible to get the best rates and carefully match it to electricity demand. A particular concern with solar power on the grid is that it’s not just large utility-scale fields of photovoltaic (PV) panels that feed power into the grid; there’s also solar power generated on rooftops. “A lot of utilities don’t have accurate data for how much PV has been installed on their grid,” said Jin Tan , a principal engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, during a webinar. That makes it harder to anticipate power spikes and drops. Still, for ordinary power users, it’s unlikely that they’ll notice anything about their electricity during the eclipse. Some utilities might have to scramble to secure extra power but that won’t manifest at the outlet. The bigger worry for everyone counting on keeping their phones, computers, and electric cars charged up is what’s over the horizon. Last year, the US set an electricity demand record under intense heat that stressed power production. The grid largely avoided blackouts, due to a combination of planning to have extra power as well as luck that demand didn’t get any higher. Grid operators also issued emergency conservation alerts to their customers, and fortunately, enough power users complied to keep the lights on. But overall energy demand in the US is growing. The amount of electricity devoured by data centers alone is poised to double by 2026 , driven by digital industries like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar power are already providing the most new capacity additions to the grid and are projected to grow further in the coming years. And the US’s aging power lines and transformers are vulnerable to extreme weather and in some cases, can trigger their own disasters. Power lines likely ignited the largest wildfire in Texas history earlier this year. So, the US’s growing appetite for energy will be fed with a larger portion of some of the most capricious generators across a fragile delivery system, leaving grid operators to walk an even thinner, higher wire as they balance the power they have with the people who need it. It will take careful preparation now to ensure the grid stays balanced in the light and does not tumble into darkness. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"2","Just a few days after the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel , which killed more than 1,200 Israelis and took place six months ago this week, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israeli troops , “What was in Gaza, will be no more.” On that pledge at least, Israel has followed through — and then some. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, more than 31,000 people have been killed in the territory, around 1.4 percent of the population. Gaza is facing a crisis level of hunger , a situation that will worsen after several aid organizations have scaled back their activities following an Israeli airstrike that killed seven aid workers this week . The Gaza Strip has been pulverized, with about 35 percent of its buildings destroyed, according to the United Nations. And around 85 percent of Gaza’s population has been displaced. In many respects, however, the war has confounded expectations. In the early days following the Hamas attacks, Israel called up some 360,000 reservists , the largest military mobilization in the country’s history. While the actual numbers deployed into Gaza have not been revealed, estimates put the number at just about 30,000 troops as of the end of last year, and many of those have now been withdrawn. When Israel launched its ground operations in late October, Israeli commanders predicted it would take around three months , before transitioning to a new phase involving stamping out last pockets of resistance and setting up a new governance structure for Gaza. Today, that timeline looks extremely optimistic at best. In late January, US intelligence agencies estimated that only about 20 to 30 percent of Hamas’s fighters had been killed and that the group still had enough munitions for months worth of strikes. Six months in, there’s still no end in sight, and the Israeli government’s post-war plans still look exceedingly vague . A mixed regional picture Beyond Gaza itself, there were widely held concerns in the days following October 7 that the conflict would spill over into a regional war. Preventing this from happening was one of the primary — if not the primary — US goals in the early days of the conflict. It’s why the Pentagon deployed assets including aircraft carrier groups to the region and issued warnings to Iran and its proxy groups not to join the conflict. Six months later, the regional picture is mixed. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah continues to exchange fire with the Israeli military over the border between the two countries. But despite some periodic threats , neither side appears interested in escalating the conflict to an all-out war. In the weeks following the start of the conflict, Iran-backed militant groups launched more than 170 attacks on US troops in the Middle East, culminating in a strike that killed three US troops in Jordan on January 28. But since the aggressive American response to that strike, these attacks have virtually stopped . It remains to be seen, however, whether this “pause” could end following a surprise Israeli strike that killed a senior Iranian military commander in Damascus , Syria, earlier this week. vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Subscribe Apart from some isolated attacks — and despite Hamas’s hopes — there have been few signs of a wider uprising among Palestinians in the West Bank , or inter-communal tensions within Israel itself. The biggest threat to political stability in Israel today comes not from the West Bank but from protests by Israelis against Netanyahu ’s rule and an ongoing political controversy involving the role of ultra-Orthodox Jews in the country’s military. The biggest surprise, regionally, has been Yemen’s Houthis, who put themselves on the map with an ongoing campaign to disrupt global shipping through the Red Sea , despite the best efforts of the US military and its allies. Beyond the Middle East, the world’s patience with Israel is running out. Global sympathy for Israel was hardly universal in the days following the Hamas attacks, but today feels a long way from those moments when the Brandenburg Gate, 10 Downing Street, and the Sydney Opera House were all lit up in the colors of the Israeli flag. As for Israel’s most important global ally, things are also shifting — but more slowly. A relationship nearing the breaking point In the early days of the conflict, President Joe Biden made a remarkable wartime visit to Israel, while part of the administration pursued what was called a “bear hug” strategy — publicly expressing solidarity while privately shaping Israel’s response. These days, the hug is looking a lot less friendly. Officials including the president himself have expressed frustration with the high toll of civilian casualties from Israel’s airstrikes and the disruptions to aid efforts in Gaza. The administration has taken a number of steps that would have been very unlikely in the early days of the war, including slapping sanctions on some Israeli settlers and allowing a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire to pass , after vetoing several previous motions. Nonetheless, despite all the internal anger and expressions of frustration , the Biden administration has resisted calls to take more dramatic steps to distance itself from the Israeli war effort , such as conditioning military aid on Israel complying with more stringent targeting standards. But that could be changing. On Thursday, White House spokesperson John Kirby said there would be changes to the US policy on Gaza if it did not see concrete steps from Israel to protect civilians and aid workers and allow in more aid in the coming “ hours and days .” What steps by Israel would satisfy that demand and what changes the US might consider if they do not are still not clear. And bigger shifts are taking place elsewhere in the US. A majority of Americans now oppose Israel’s military actions, with support dropping from 50 percent to 36 percent between November and March. The drop is most pronounced among Democrats, but even Donald Trump , who rarely missed an opportunity to tout his pro-Israel bona fides and back Netanyahu while he was president, now says it’s time for the war to end . Whatever the next six months bring, there has likely been a permanent and long-lasting shift in the US-Israel relationship.

"2","One consequence of being a journalist since, oh, the 20th century, is that you accumulate a track record. In the hundreds and hundreds of stories I’ve published over the last 25 years, some look eerily prescient (like this cover story from 2017 warning about a coming pandemic ). Some are weird. (Did I really write a story in 2007 about bars in Tokyo where men dress up as English butlers to entertain female customers? Apparently .) And then there are the stories that maybe haven’t aged all that well. Case in point: In 2013, I wrote a feature for Time magazine with the cover line: “A world without bees.” The gist of it is that colony collapse disorder (CCD) — a still not fully understood syndrome that began killing honeybee colonies in large numbers beginning around the mid-2000s — was in danger of wiping out honeybees altogether in the US. And that in turn would mean catastrophe for the many crops that depend on honeybee pollination . An advantage (or drawback) of being in journalism this long is that the predictions you made, say, 11 years ago, have time to play out. And as you may have noticed on your last visit to the supermarket, our agricultural system hasn’t collapsed. Almonds — which are so dependent on commercial honeybee pollination that something like 42 billion bees are used during almond trees’ spring growing season — have seen their acreage more than double since 2007, when CCD was first identified. If honeybees were truly dying out, you wouldn’t see almond milk everywhere . As the Washington Post’s Andrew Van Dam wrote in a delightful column last week , the US may actually have more honeybees now than it ever has before. Data from the US Department of Agriculture’s extremely detailed Census of Agriculture indicates that there were, quite precisely, 3,800,015 honeybee colonies in the US in 2022. That’s a startling 31 percent increase from 2007, and a larger increase than any other domesticated animals. Even chickens, which usually top these sorts of data tables . So does that mean those who (ahem) predicted a possible “world without bees” were wrong? Yes. Does it mean that everything’s all good with Apis mellifera, better known as the Western honeybee? Not quite, because honeybees are still dying in massive numbers. According to the most recent survey data , beekeepers lost 48.2 percent of their managed honeybee colonies between April 2022 and April 2023, chiefly due to infestations of Varroa mites and the viruses associated with them . That’s nearly 10 percentage points higher than the previous year. So we have a situation where there are apparently more honeybee colonies than there have ever been but honeybees are still dying by the billions from CCD and assorted other threats. What gives? A lot of the confusion, it turns out, stems from the difference between how we think about honeybees and how we actually use them. Honeybees aren’t what you think There’s a reason the USDA is in charge of counting up how many honeybee colonies there are in the US, and not, say, the Interior Department or the Environmental Protection Agency. That’s because honeybees aren’t a wild species — they’re essentially a farmed one. Honeybees aren’t even native to North America — they’re colonists of a kind, first brought here by European settlers in the 17th century. And while a small number of them today are used to produce honey , the vast majority are effectively harnessed as biological machines to support specialized agriculture. Consider the great spring almond pollination. Some 80 percent of the world’s almond supply comes from California’s Central Valley with trees that need honeybees for pollination. So every spring, beekeepers from around the US bring their colonies to California to carry out that lucrative pollination. And it’s lucrative: About $4 of every $5 spent on what the USDA calls “bee fertility assistance” goes to support the almond crop. That, in part, is why bee colony numbers have kept growing even as the toll from CCD and other threats to honeybees have continued to mount. Simply put, honeybees are so valuable that even as they continue to die in large numbers, it’s economically viable to keep replacing them. (Another contributor, as the Post story points out, is that agriculture tax breaks make it valuable for more farmers to raise a small number of bee colonies on their land.) Rather than thinking of honeybees as a species in peril like the red wolf or the right whale , a better analogy is to factory-farmed chickens. Like chickens, honeybees are stressed to the killing point by the conditions of mass farming (in the bees’ case, the stress of being moved across the country to service California almond trees ). And just like chickens — where H5N1 bird flu has been taking a severe toll on poultry farms — honeybees contend with diseases and parasites that feast on their weakened condition . Yet both chickens and honeybees are so valuable that it’s in farmers’ economic interest to more than replace what they lose, with the result that numbers keep going up. Which is not the same thing as saying that honeybees are doing all right. “You wouldn’t be like, ‘Hey, birds are doing great. We’ve got a huge biomass of chickens!” Eliza Grames, a biologist at Binghamton University, told the Post. “It’s kind of the same thing with honeybees.” Bees are what they’re worth A lot of the coverage at the height of the beepocalypse fears — my story included — used the mass death of honeybees as a symbol of how human beings had pulled nature out of whack. But it’s not, mostly because there is nothing natural about the way we’ve used honeybees over the past few decades, just as there is nothing natural about a factory farming system that raises and kills nearly 10 billion chickens each year . Capitalism, as it turns out, is really, really good at finding solutions to scarcity when enough money is on the line. The mid-2000s moment that CCD was first entering the public consciousness also marked the height of fears around “peak oil” : the idea that the world had entered a terminal decline in oil production, with cataclysmic results for the global economy . And there was reason to believe this was true: On January 2, 2008, oil hit $100 a barrel for the first time , while US oil production had been declining for decades. Capitalism, though, finds a way . In part because oil had become so valuable, companies and governments invested in new technologies and new efforts to find unknown or previously untapped resources. Cut to today, when the world is producing more oil than it did during the peak days of “peak oil” and the US has become the single largest oil producer ever . So we have honeybees and we have oil because that’s what the market demands. But the market doesn’t care about the condition of those billions of hard-working bees any more than it cares about the climate consequences of keeping the oil taps flowing, because it ultimately doesn’t care about that which cannot be priced. Unless we require it to. Which is why the real beepocalypse isn’t found among those millions of managed honeybee colonies, but among the thousands of wild, native bee species, nearly half of which are in some danger of extinction . No commercial beekeepers are coming to their rescue. We won’t have a world without honeybees anytime soon, but we may be headed toward a world where they are the only bees.

Less than 20 years down the line, it feels like that promise has been broken. Streaming is more expensive than ever, and prices just keep going up. Password sharing has been cracked down on, forcing more of us to pay to stream. The content we love is more-often-than-not fragmented across many different streaming services. And in the backdrop of all that, advertising is back with a vengeance, thanks to the rise of the cheaper ad-supported subscription tiers. As a consumer, this feels infuriating.

"2","A magnitude 4.8 earthquake rocked the East Coast midmorning on Friday, sending high rises swaying in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. Californians and other West Coasters may scoff at the alarm expressed by their East Coast counterparts from a seemingly small quake. But this tremor struck the most densely populated region of the US, rocking some of the oldest buildings in the country, and alarming people who often take it for granted that the earth doesn’t move very much. So it’s worth taking seriously. Can’t believe I got it on camera lol #earthquake pic.twitter.com/OevQ5q30ZF — jared (@jareddemel) April 5, 2024 The East Coast is indeed much less geologically active than the Western US, with fewer active fault lines that cause major earthquakes. There are, however, frequent smaller tremors. The US Geological Survey notes that the eastern part of the country has experienced more than 400 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 3.5 over the past 50 years. As recently as 2011, a magnitude 5.8 quake that struck Virginia caused shaking to be felt along the East Coast and some damage to buildings in Washington, DC. The Eastern US experiences less frequent and severe earthquakes compared to the West Coast. US Geological Survey Why the East Coast quakes hit different than the ones out West One distinction between earthquakes in the eastern and western US is the nature of the ground below. The rock beneath the eastern US is older and denser than the subsurface out west, so waves of shaking Earth travel further. “In the Western US, the ground under us is warmer and it’s chopped up by faults and seismic waves get attenuated (filtered out),” said Robert de Groot , who leads public outreach for the US Geological Survey’s ShakeAlert earthquake early-warning system in the western US, in an email. “Think of the subsurface as a hall of mirrors and lenses. Waves get scattered, redirected, etc.” As with any earthquake, there is a chance of aftershocks , though they are often weaker than the preceding quake. Related We know where the next big earthquakes will happen — but not when The West Coast also has a long history of designing structures to tolerate earthquakes. Though tremors tend to be weaker in the East, over the years, states along the Atlantic coast have revised their building codes so homes, offices, stores, and warehouses can better withstand shaking. But these new codes only apply to new buildings, and there are a lot of aging, historic structures that are still used today — especially in cities like New York. “Your community probably has many older structures that are not protected against earthquakes,” the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) writes on its website. “These existing buildings are the single biggest contributor to seismic risk in the United States today.” What you should do when you feel an earthquake While earthquake safety is old hat for people who grew up on the West Coast, many in the Northeast had no idea what to do when the ground started shaking. (Other than tweeting .) The old advice of getting under a door frame right away no longer holds. “In modern houses, doorways are no stronger than any other part of the house, and the doorway does not protect you from the most likely source of injury: falling or flying objects,” according to the University of Washington’s emergency preparedness department . “You also may not be able to brace yourself in the door during strong shaking. You are safer under a table.” There is instead a new mantra: “The best advice is Drop, Cover, and Hold On if you feel shaking,” said de Groot. What that means is get to your hands and knees, cover your head and neck with an arm while you get under a table or desk, and hold onto a piece of furniture. Avoid exterior walls, windows, and hanging objects. Don’t get in an elevator, take the stairs, or try to run out of the building. If you’re in bed, stay there. Lie face down, and cover your head and neck with a pillow. If you’re outdoors, move to an open space away from buildings. If you’re driving, pull over and set the parking brake, avoiding overpasses, trees, and power lines. Earthquakes are surprising and they can be dangerous and destructive, but with proper precautions, they don’t have to be deadly. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","M SNBC host Joy Reid thinks that people who are opposed to the complex that is “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” are racists. In fact, she goes so far as to say that people are opposed to DEI because they “can’t stand black people.” “At this point, it’s evident what they mean by DEI, right? It means black people,” she said on her show, The ReidOut , last week. “It’s the reason the Right complained about critical race theory. It’s not fashionable to be openly racist anymore in America, unlike what they call the good old days.” Reid furthered her argument in a pair of odd TikToks she posted last week. In both, she argued that opposition to DEI comes from jealous white people who are upset that they are outperformed by minorities. She said : “Just a thought, maybe, maybe rather than the problem really being DEI, just a thought, maybe the problem is you. Like when your son Chad for instance doesn’t get into Harvard or Yale, maybe it’s not affirmative action. Maybe Chad’s application just kind of sucked.” Reid has this upside down. Opposition to DEI is one and the same with opposition to racism. In fact, opposition to DEI is fervent opposition to racism. It is support for treating people as individuals rather than reducing them to their race. It is the belief that people should be hired for a job because of the skills and abilities that they possess — and not because of their race, sex, etc. When institutions choose individuals who are less suited for a position than others simply because of their race, they commit an injustice. And, no, Joy Reid, the fact that this happens frequently in America is not theoretical. Take, for example, medical school applications. In the United States, Hispanic and black medical school applicants possess a huge advantage . The average black medical student in the United States scored at the 66th percentile in the MCAT, a test that is highly predictive of medical school success. The average Asian student, on the other hand, scored at the 88th percentile on the MCAT. This is blatant, demonstrable discrimination against Asians. This is racism. Joy Reid doesn’t end, however, with the claim that those who are opposed to DEI are racists. No, she takes it much further than that. She thinks that white conservative Christians wish to remove people of other races from the country. In January, she asserted that white Christians “see themselves as the rightful inheritors of this country.” Then, in February, Reid attacked Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville for commenting that the United States “needs more kids.” She postulated that this could have been motivated by a desire for a “great replacement” and that what Tuberville was really saying is he wants more white kids. It was also this belief that led Reid to assert that Nikki Haley, whose parents immigrated to the United States from India, lost the Iowa caucuses on the basis of “racism.” She claimed that white conservative Christians did not care about Nikki Haley’s “electability” because “none of that matters when you believe that God has given you this country, that everyone who is not a white conservative Christian is a fraudulent American, is a less real American.” Then, this month, Reid asserted that Republicans vote solely on “ racial animus .” Wait a second — what country does Joy Reid live in? In my experience, conservative Christians in the United States are probably among the least racist people in human history. And all of American society was among the best in regard to racial harmony in all of human history. At least that was the case until the Black Lives Matter movement and woke progressives launched their project to inject racial awareness into every aspect of life. In 2014, 72 percent of white adults and 66 percent of black adults said that relations between white and black Americans were very or somewhat good, according to Gallup . But, by 2021, only 43 percent of white adults and 33 percent of black adults professed the same belief. The answer for how to return to America’s previous racial harmony is simple: End DEI.

"1","Editor’s Note: This is the final installment of Scott McKay’s new novel, King of the Jungle , which has been released exclusively at The American Spectator in 10 episodes weekly since February. It will be published in full on Amazon on April 12. PREORDER YOUR COPY HERE ! So far in the story, our narrator Mike Holman, an independent media man and podcaster, has agreed to write a biography and work as a public-relations consultant with his friend and old college roommate, the billionaire industrialist Pierce Polk — only to find that Polk has built a small city in the jungles of Guyana as a redoubt away from the corrupt Joe Deadhorse administration back home in America. But Guyana has been invaded by Venezuela, as the corrupt Madiera regime in Caracas, doing the bidding of its foreign partners, seeks the vast mineral wealth of its jungles and the ocean off its coast. Now, Polk’s jungle paradise is on the front lines of a hot war. Venezuela, backed by a host of global villains, is attempting to consolidate its gains against the near-helpless Guyanese military, but Polk and his jungle holdouts haven’t been fully heard from. How does the story end? Here’s the dramatic finale of our story… June 24, 2024, Georgetown, Guyana Jaganoo was as good as his word in not surrendering to the Vinnies that day, but his people put out a statement that he was going to address the nation at 9 a.m. the next morning. And then he was arrested by the Guyana Defense Force at 8 a.m. It was Darke who addressed the nation. When he did, he said that Jaganoo had been arrested for treason and that Ishgan, the president, was out of commission for a “medical condition.” Which turned out to be a fentanyl overdose. Somebody had dosed him with three times the fatal amount, and the only thing that saved him was a miracle; Ishgan’s personal doctor had been a block away from the Marriott and had a Narcan pen in his bag. But he was still practically comatose a day later. For all practical purposes, Ishgan was knocked out of the game. That made Darke effectively the interim president. And as his first act, he announced that Guyana would not surrender to Venezuela under any circumstances, and he openly called for help from “the community of nations to help us restore the internationally recognized borders of the Republic of Guyana.” There was good news and bad news on that score. The good news came in the southern part of the country. The Vinnies who had been dropped into those little villages in the Rupununi river valley had generally been scattered into very small units, and they’d suffered a lot of losses to helicopters getting shot down. Not to mention the locals tended to be pretty well armed and fairly decently led, and the Guyanese were for the most part kicking their asses. Of course, the plan had been that the Venezuelans would reinforce their initial gains. They couldn’t really do that in the south because of the trouble back home. And that got worse and worse for them because just after the naval attack somebody hacked the central bank in Caracas and wiped out, well, everything. Yes, you read that correctly. The hack all but destroyed all of the Venezuelan central bank’s current records and locked the Madiera government out of most of its financial resources. Not to mention those hackers also hit the power grid in Caracas, Maracaibo, Ciudad Guayana, Puerto Cabello, and Barquisimeto, which plunged a big chunk of the population into darkness. Then de la Vega flew to Curacao and took a helicopter into Coro, a coastal city west of Caracas. He said the revolution was afoot, and that Madiera no longer had the consent of the people of Venezuela to continue as the president. Burnham, Darke, and Pierce were on a Zoom call that PJ and I sat in on that morning after Darke had taken over, and we had a surprising guest join in. “Mr. President,” said Burnham. “It’s a pleasant surprise to have you.” “I’m happy to be here,” said Trumbull. “And Tommy — I can call you Tommy? — Gilchrist says you’re a hell of a guy, so you’re all right with me.” “Yes, sir,” Burnham laughed. “Hey Pierce, how ya holdin’ up down in the sticks?” said Trumbull. “I’m the King of the Jungle,” said Pierce. “I might never leave. No army is about to dig me out of here, I can tell you.” Trumbull chuckled. “Wait a minute,” he said. “Mike, is that Pauline you’ve got with you?” “Yes, sir,” she said. “Wow!” he said. “I like what you’ve done with your hair. You look like that girl, oh, what’s her name…” “Thanks, Mr. President,” PJ said, and I could tell she was in no mood to be compared to any dye-blond Chinese starlets. “Right. Anyway,” Trumbull said, “I heard what’s going on down there and it seems like it could be at least a little helpful if I did a quick fly-in and endorsed Ravi here — it’s Ravi, right?” “Yes, Mr. President,” said Darke. “Ravi. Hell of a guy, and bold stuff you’re doing. Anyway, if you guys think it’ll help, I’ll fly down from Palm Beach, say hi, give a speech about how Venezuela has got to go back, and I’ll say that when I’m back in office all of this will get put right, and in the meantime Ravi will keep up the fight. Y’know, buck up the folks a little.” “I think that could only help,” said Pierce. “If nothing else, it’ll shame Deadhorse into doing something,” said Burnham. “I believe things will ultimately turn in Essequibo,” said Darke. “The southern part of the region seems to be returning to our control thanks to the efforts of the indigenous population.” “That’s good,” said Trumbull. “That’s really good. You’ve gotta hang on. And Pierce, your guys have to hang on, too.” “We’re doing more than that,” said Pierce. “Right, great. I want you guys to hang onto that oil! You can’t let China” — he pronounced it CHY-na — “get those offshore rigs. Yuge to hold on to those. I mean it.” “No, sir,” said Burnham. “We have some plans in that regard,” said Pierce. “So look,” said Trumbull. “They tell me you can’t really fly into Georgetown now, right? Airport is messed up?” “The runways were hit with missiles,” said Darke. “It will be a few days before they’re operational again.” “Well, then we could wait, or maybe I could do something else,” said Trumbull. “What if I flew in someplace close and then you came and got me in a chopper and flew me in that way?” “That’s the best idea,” said Pierce. “We’ll fly you in to Paramaribo, in Suriname, and then chopper you to Georgetown. It’s like 200 miles away.” “Oof,” said Trumbull. “Oh, come on. You’ll get to ride in on the Sikorsky V-92. You’ll be here in an hour from the tarmac in Paramaribo.” “You brought your Sikorsky down, Pierce?” Trumbull was impressed. Pierce shook his head. “This is the second one.” Trumbull chuckled. “They say I’m rich, but nobody’s loaded like this guy.” PJ leaned in. “We’re out of place with all these super-rich guys,” she said. “They’re talking about private helicopters.” “Excuse me,” I whispered back, “but isn’t your dad rich like this?” “I’m not my dad.” “That’s why I love you.” Blurting that out surprised the shit out of both of us. “Oh, I…” she whispered. I didn’t know what to say. “Hey,” Trumbull was saying, “Mike, are you paying attention?” “Yes, sir,” I said. “Sorry, Mr. President.” “What I’m thinking is that maybe you could do the interview on the chopper tomorrow. Meet me in Paramaribo, we’ll get on the helicopter and then that gives us an hour.” “It’s a great idea,” I said. “But PJ here — er, Pauline — will come with, because she’s pitching in as my cameraman now.” “Yeah? Nice. She’s definitely welcome. Plus, she’s muscle. You always need as much muscle as you can get, right?” “That’s my experience, sir,” I said, humoring him. Trumbull signed off, and so we now had a former, and possibly future, American president coming to Guyana to raise awareness about the war. But when the president checked out, the conversation turned. “The issue,” Darke was saying, “is the north.” Pierce’s hit on that naval flotilla was a success, but the Santa Cruz didn’t pick off all of those boats heading into the Essequibo River. It would have been impossible. They didn’t have enough torpedoes. And more important was to protect the oil platforms to the north, because the Vinnies sent a bunch of their naval ships in the direction of the platforms. The sub gave chase and hit one of them with a torpedo, which turned away the little armada. But in the meantime, the flotilla along the coast simply went ashore. And when it did, it disgorged several thousand Venezuelan troops, which were shortly commandeering vehicles from the locals and holding all of the lightly populated western coastline from the Essequibo to the Venezuelan border. And they already held basically everything north of the Potaro in the interior. Darke was saying that what was needed was impossible, namely, a counterattack to dislodge them before they could consolidate those gains and — we all knew this was coming — bring in the Chinese to begin exploiting them. “Wish we had an army to do that,” said Burnham. “You guys are thinking about this the wrong way,” said Pierce. And I could see him moving aside to make room for Hal Gibson in the Zoom call. “Hi everybody,” said Gibson. “Look, the day after tomorrow there is a ceremony at the waterfall. Madiera is coming and he’s going to declare victory at Kaietur Falls.” “Is he really?” I said. “We think they’re going to call a ceasefire and try to claim what they took,” said Pierce. “It’s really the only move they’ve got.” “And the north has more economic assets,” said Darke. “That they can sell to China,” said PJ. “Well, how do we break up that party?” I asked. “You let us handle that,” said Pierce. “Do we want to know more than that?” asked Burnham. “No,” said Hal. “You do not.” “OK, then,” I said. “Brigadier Darke, can you make security arrangements for a Trumbull pop-in?” “I believe so,” he said, “given that we have a true professional with us to show us the way.” “OK, security pro,” said Pierce, “what do you need from us?” I think PJ was the last to realize they were talking to her. “Oh, wait,” she said. Once she realized she had a job to do, PJ moved fast. She had Pierce send her six guys from Liberty Point, and she got Darke to set up the ballroom at the Pegasus Hotel, which was the other nice place in town, as the venue for Trumbull to speak. Still, I sat there watching her work the phones, and then I rode with her as Desmond came to get us and brought us to the Pegasus, and she had the folks at that hotel jumping as she rearranged their whole setup in preparation for Trumbull’s arrival. Everything from closing the pool bar and rearranging the beach chairs, eliminating any possible vantage from which a shooter could get at Trumbull from the time he got off the chopper in the parking lot just on the ocean side of the hotel to his speech in the ballroom, to his exit out of the hotel’s side entrance to the convoy of SUVs she organized and to the reboarding of the chopper at the police college a block away. She spent the whole night, practically, coordinating with Trumbull’s team and the Guyana Police Force and Darke’s people. She was still doing it when I decided to head to bed. “Can I do anything?” I asked. “Nope. This is my stuff.” I didn’t see her the next morning. Not until about 11, when Desmond came to pick me up and take me to what was left of the airport, where Pierce’s Sikorsky was waiting. PJ was there, wearing a black business suit that reminded me very much of the Secret Service agent she’d been so recently. “You look rumpled,” Holman,” she said. “You don’t have a tie?” “Trumbull isn’t going to wear one,” I said. “So I’m not.” She rolled her eyes, and we boarded the Sikorsky. And an hour later we were landing at the airport in Paramaribo, or better put the airport south of Paramaribo, because it was really nowhere near that city, and not long after, Trumbull’s plane zoomed in from the north and he got off on the tarmac. The president of Suriname and a few of his people insisted on welcoming Trumbull as he debarked, and Trumbull spent a few minutes making pleasantries before he shook my hand. “Hey, Mike,” he said. “Big times, huh? And look at Pauline! Back to the old tricks, right?” “Mr. President,” she smiled. “I’m wearing two hats on this trip, but you know which one is most important.” “Right,” he said. “So let’s go!” He shook all the Surinamese hands, and Pauline and his two security guys hustled him into the chopper. I followed. And for the next hour we did an interview which, honestly, I would have liked to take back. Trumbull, I could tell, was nervous. Halfway through, he stopped. “Hey, off the record?” he asked. “Sure,” I responded. “I’m kinda thinking this was rash, comin’ down here. I mean, it’s still a war going on, right?” “Well, yes and no. It’s something of a stalemate and we’re hoping Venezuela’s government falls apart.” “Yeah, I know your guy is doin’ everything he can to dick ‘em over. Think that’ll work?” “I learned a long time ago not to doubt him, but this is a pretty big project.” “I’m just saying, Mike. I don’t wanna be a pussy. But I got shot in Indiana of all places and here I’m goin’ to Guyana.” He more or less mumbled his way through the rest of the interview, saying his usual things, trashing Deadhorse and promising that if he got put back in charge it would be “no trouble at all” to put the world back right, and to kick out all the Omobba spies and saboteurs embedded in the Executive Branch. “These guys,” he said, “my first term they had an advantage over me. It’s gonna be different the second go-round. You know, the presidency’s a big job. You need a lot of help. Gotta have the right people or it’s all fucked. Wait, edit that out, will ya?” “We’ll bleep it.” “Right. OK, whatever. But Deadhorse, I mean, come on. I told everybody he was senile four years ago and they weren’t listening. But now? Nobody’s arguin’ anymore. Did you hear what he said yesterday? He said he was the lead singer for the Eagles before Don Henley. Where does he even get shit like that?” PJ was happily rolling away with her camera. I thought it was interesting; she’d been a giant ball of stress from the time she’d gotten drafted back into her old job, and while she attacked it with a passion I found amazing she’d gone from friendly and polite to irritable and grumpy. But now? I was convinced that camera was therapeutic for her. We ended the interview early, mostly because Trumbull was more interested in asking me questions. “Mike, you’ve been down here most of the last month. What do you think of Guyana? What’s the deal here?” “I think if the Vinnies…” “Who’s the Vinnies?” “Sorry. The Venezuelans. If they can get chased off, I think Guyana has some real potential. And I think what you’re going to want to do is knock out some sort of free trade deal with them.” “Yeah?” “Yeah. And because they’re going to need a big infusion of labor, especially for construction with all the industry that the offshore oil will bring in, I’d make plans to deport a bunch of those illegals you’re talking about getting rid of to here.” “Oooh. That’s an idea. So the Guyanese would take ‘em in and make ‘em guest workers?” “I bet they’d be open to it.” “Who? This guy Darke?” “They’re going to do elections in a few weeks. He’s not going to run.” “Who is?” “Not sure, but the guy I imagine might win is Earl Roberts.” “Guy named Earl? Sounds like he fixes cars.” “He’s actually a war hero. Pierce’s guy. I think you’ll meet him in Georgetown.” Trumbull nodded. “Well, good. After this, have him call me and I’ll help if I can.” We landed in a cleared-out parking lot, and I could see PJ tense up again. She and Trumbull’s bodyguards made a phalanx around him and walked him into the hotel. Security was tight as we made our way to the ballroom, where several hundred people had taken seats. The applause was thunderous as Trumbull and his party made their way through the side door. Darke was on stage, applauding, and he and Trumbull shared a quick exchange and a handshake as the former president came to the podium. Then it was Trumbull’s turn. And he held forth for about a half hour about how “lousy communists” were ruining the world and how the good folks of Guyana were the front lines against them. “I know you guys have the fight in you,” he said, “and soon you’ll have your country back. All of it.” That took the roof off, and the crowd rose to their feet yelling, screaming and clapping. It was like a rock concert. And Trumbull shook hands with Darke and a few other Guyanese politicians, not to mention Burnham and a couple of other American businesspeople who were there. Then he shook Earl’s hand and took a picture with him and told him, “Call me, and I’ll make sure you get elected. You’re a hell of a guy.” Then it was time to take Trumbull out of the hotel to the SUVs parked at the side exit. That happened without a hitch. Then we were headed east along Seawall Public Road for about a block, then came a right turn into the Guyana Police Depot, which was half-destroyed by the missile strike, and then a left into the grass parking lot where the chopper had relocated and was whirling away, prepared for a fast takeoff, and then we all got out… “Wait, no,” PJ said. “That’s not how we set this up.” “What’s wrong?” I said. “That pile of timber was supposed to be cleared!” she said, pointing at an unwanted obstruction to the right. Two of Pierce’s guys took off running for the woodpile, and then PJ looked back to the left. “Get down!” I could hear her say as she brushed past me… …and then I heard the shot. It would probably have taken Trumbull’s head off. He’d crouched down in front of the chopper, and the shooter had positioned himself behind one of those decorative cinder-block walls that was constructed in a checkerboard-type fashion, next to the road. Instead, it hit PJ. She dove in front of Trumbull just in time. Everything was a bit of a blur at that point. Immediately, the guns began blazing in the direction of that wall, and Pierce’s six-man team closed on the shooter in no time flat and before he could get into the getaway car he was down. So was the getaway driver. Meanwhile, Trumbull’s bodyguards whisked him into the chopper, and it launched about as quickly as I’ve ever seen. Up and away it went, and for a moment it was just PJ and me on the grass field. “PJ!” I said, rolling her over gently. “How you doing, honey? Are you hit?” “You know I’m hit, dummy,” she said. “You saw me get hit.” “Where?” “Think hard. No, wait — please don’t roll me on my back.” “Oh, no. You didn’t…” “My ass,” she said. “I got shot in my beautiful, half-Asian ass.” She was laying on her side, crying and laughing at the same time. “Well, you saved Donny Trumbull’s life, hon,” I said. “That’s it,” she said. “I quit.” The shooter didn’t die despite taking eight bullets from Pierce’s guys and the Guyanese cops who fell asleep rather than stopping that car when it drove around their barricade on Seawall Public Road. It turned out that his name was Mohammed Hosseini, and he was Iranian. Because of course he was. And the getaway driver’s name was Enrique Contreras of Cienfuegos, Cuba, who turned out to be in the employ of the Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional, or the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service, headquartered in Caracas, Venezuela. Contreras even had his SEBIN ID on him. That’s how arrogant these assholes were. All of that we found out later. I helped as Pierce’s guys gently laid her across the back seat of the SUV, with her head on my lap and my belt tightened across her hip, her jacket pressed tight against her derriere in order to manage the bleeding, and tried to joke with her as we raced the few blocks to St. Joseph’s Mercy Hospital down the street. They took her immediately into an operating room, and the next time I saw her she was in a hospital gown lying on her side with a big wad of gauze wrapped around her stitched-up right butt-cheek. PJ was all tranked up on whatever they’d given her, but she still had plenty of gas left in the tank. And as soon as they let me in to see her, she was awfully chatty. “I got an email from Trumbull,” I said. “He wanted me to pass along his thanks for saving his life. He said you can have any job in his administration that you want. Just name it.” “Forget that,” she said. “Really?” PJ shook her head. “You’re gonna give me a damn good job as your videographer,” she said. “Like, I’m not hearing no from you. That’s the last bullet I’m taking for a politician. So it’s on you now. Make me a job offer.” “What is this, emotional blackmail?” I said. “Hey, I get to do that to you.” “Since when?” “Since you said you love me.” She had me there. July 31, 2024, Lake Lanier, Georgia I finished Pierce’s biography a lot faster than I expected. It’s coming out on August 15, and we went with the obvious title: King of the Jungle: How One of America’s Greatest Industrialists Held Off a Communist Invasion I think it’s going to do well. We’ve got over 400,000 copies already sold via pre-order. And I’m publishing it through Holman Media. Tom did a fantastic deal with a printer and a distributor, plus we already had the online store on the site, so we’re going to make a killing off this thing. It’s a good book, though I feel a little guilty taking credit for it when Flip, Colby, and a couple of the other writers at the site pitched in with the writing and editing. It was really more of a community project than something I did. Of course, all of the background and history leading up to Guyana was my stuff. That was the part I could write in my sleep, and I practically did. The rest came from a bunch of group interviews we did with Pierce via Zoom. He was starting to turn into a hermit down there, though I guess I couldn’t blame him. And we didn’t put that in the book. The title is accurate, by the way. Guyana did win that war. In fact, they managed to get their whole country back. How? Well, the government changed over in Caracas, and General de la Vega was only too happy to pull his troops out of there. Especially after what happened to Madiera. Anybody could have told that arrogant bastard that going to Kaietur Falls and bragging about winning the war, when they’d really done anything but, was a bad idea. It was the last idea he ever had. Madiera was at the little airport a little ways from the waterfall, and they’d put a little podium festooned with Venezuelan flags out for him to speak in front of the cameras and the little crowd of sycophants he’d brought with him. His party had walked up to the waterfall to look at it, and then they actually toasted each other with champagne. Then he came back to that podium to give his dumb little speech about how they’d decided to split the difference with the Guyanese en aras de la paz . In the interests of peace. What bullshit. You probably know what came next. The bullet came next. Right in the forehead. Nobody saw the shooter. It was estimated he’d had to have been in one of the trees set back from the little airport building. The shot had to be a good 1,500 yards away. To this day it’s completely unknown who’s responsible. And I don’t know, either. I don’t even have a theory. I do have an idea, and it makes me smile. My idea is it was a very well-preserved, handsome middle-aged black guy. My thought is that he lined up his shot, and under his breath he said, “Here am I. Send me.” Then he took a breath, then slowly exhaled and pulled the trigger. And when Madiera went down, on national TV in Venezuela — interestingly enough, the power came back on all over the country just a couple of hours before the proceedings at the waterfall — there were people in the streets. Not rioting. Celebrating. After that it was de la Vega, and the end of the war. The Venezuelans came home from Guyana, and even, in a surprising number of cases, from the U.S. and elsewhere in North America. And the Cubans all got packed off and sent home, where they could be a problem for the Castro gang instead of the Venezuelan people. Pierce even cut Cabrillo loose and let him go home, though we found out that his wife had filed for divorce and split with all of his money as soon as he was captured. One rumor had it that she was in Panama. Another was that she’d taken up with a cartel boss in Monterrey. Meanwhile, Darke proved to be a lot cleverer than anybody thought, though I suspect he had help. Sino-Petro found their portion of those offshore oil fields nationalized and then leased to a brand new public company, Guyana Petroleum Export Company, or Guyanapec. Which is expected to have its initial public offering when the Exchange of the Americas opens on January 6. And yeah, I did get around to selling my house in Buckhead. I was thinking maybe I’d hold onto it after all. But when I brought PJ home a few days after that incident in Georgetown, she waddled around the place and just looked at me with her nose scrunched up. “No?” I said. “I can see you living here by yourself,” she said. “But we can do better. You’re big-time now, and you’ve got me.” Instead, she found us this VRBO on Lake Lanier. I almost passed out at the price, but she told me not to worry about it. I suspected her dad was going to foot the bill, and I later found out I was right. He might have hated the idea of her throwing in with me, but at the end of the day PJ was his little girl. “It’s so you can take care of me while I recover,” she said about that ritzy rental. “Then we’ll find something more our style.” I will say this — there are few things more conducive to getting a whole lot of writing done in not that much time than a big, luxurious lakehouse with a deck out on the water. And a hot chick in a bikini watching you from the lounge chair a couple of feet away as you bang away at your laptop. Even if she does have a telltale scar on her ass. Trumbull had us come to Milwaukee for the convention. He brought PJ up on the stage and said she’d saved his life. “She’s a hero,” he said, as the crowd went wild. “And believe it or not she’s with that guy Holman. Can you imagine that? There’s no accounting for love, right?” I didn’t mind taking shit from Trumbull in front of the whole country. I was too happy for PJ. She was beaming. She told me that her career exit was even better than John Elway’s, if maybe a little more painful. By the way, there are rumors that Deadhorse is going to drop out of the race right before his convention next month. Are they true? Maybe. But after that incident at that black church in North Carolina where he went off script and told the parishioners, “You dumb n***ers had better turn out the vote for me,” it’s a good bet he’s done. But if he goes, who knows who they’ll replace him with? Maybe we do. You might have to watch our next podcast if you want to find out.

"1","One of my favorite plans this time of year is to go on a picnic. The first to go on a picnic were cavemen, on a hill, on a huge slate stone; they just didn’t know they were having a picnic. The menu was not the same as it is nowadays, and besides, checkered tablecloths and thermos flasks had not yet been invented. Moreover, in the Stone Age, wasps ran away from men, not the other way around. And the truth is that eating in the middle of the countryside in prehistoric times didn’t make you very original. As a picnic expert, I want to help you prepare yours today. ( READ MORE from Itxu Díaz: The Best Kind of Hippie: A Classy One ) Choose the Right Place I guess you can have a picnic wherever you like. Pay attention to the signs, see where the wind comes from, figure out if you’ll need to set up an umbrella, and frown. Above all, frown a lot. This will make the rest of the family think you know exactly what you’re doing when it comes to choosing the right picnic spot. In the countryside, some places are marked with a sign that says, “No picnic.” That’s the perfect place to have a cigarette. The Sting At any picnic, one of the guests will be stung by an insect, usually a wasp or a bee. The likelihood of the sting being suffered by the most allergic of those present is directly proportional to the distance from the nearest hospital. You know you are allergic when you look worse than the bee, which dies after the sting. Since it’s unavoidable, and that means it can’t be avoided, the best thing to do before unpacking is to have a volunteer snatch at a wasp or a swarm of bees and provoke the sting. This saves time and avoids the always unpleasant element of surprise. Guest Animals A common mistake made by vacationers who go on picnics is believing that animals will respect their food, their hammock, or their chosen space. You are in the countryside. Therefore, no matter where you put yourself, animal rights will prevail. Unless you’re picnicking on a rooftop in Times Square, which in turn presents other drawbacks. Food The ideal picnic food is omelet, croquettes, and blue cheese spherification over frozen tomato drops with wild manzanita liver foam and petals of pink pepper still tonic butter. Fire Nowadays it is forbidden to light a fire in a field, and almost anywhere on earth. If you really want to organize a barbecue and you want to avoid the fine, try to do it under water. The Season The real purpose of going on a picnic in summer is to enjoy a nap in the open air in the shade of a tree, one of life’s great pleasures. It is customary to comment on “how different things taste in the countryside!” while savoring a slice of vacuum-packed tasteless cooked ham and offering it to others, who in turn must reply, “It’s true, how wonderful, what a different taste.” After this stupid ritual, you can go to sleep. The Car The picnic never takes place in an easily accessible location. It is almost always held in a beautiful meadow that cannot be accessed by car. An age-old controversy always arises around Dad in these circumstances. Once the place to put the checkered tablecloth is chosen, the big question arises: Do I put the car there too, or not? From my extensive experience, I will give you a piece of advice: Don’t put it there. However, from that same experience, I will give you another piece of advice: Put it there as soon as possible. You’re going to park it there anyway, so save yourself the hesitation, measuring the potholes, the investigation of possible rocks hidden in the grass, and the odds of wrecking the underbody. If you hear rattling, bumping, or squeaking during the operation, you’re going too slow. Speed up. If you hear screaming, count the passengers again. The Dog When you have a picnic in the middle of a field, the smell of your food floats for miles and reaches every dog on earth. This means that your picnic sends an automatic invitation to lunch for about 400 billion dogs in the world, not counting political dogs. Not all of them are likely to come. Or at least, not at once. But you should be prepared for at least one very hungry canine diner to show up uninvited. The dog will show up, and you’ll have to decide between throwing food off for him (doesn’t work, because he eats it and comes back even more eagerly), not flinching (they say if you don’t move, I don’t know what), standing up, picking up the whole picnic and running away (it will bite you on the ass), or trying to reason with the mutt (my experience: Dogs couldn’t care less about your constitutional rights). Whether the dog is friendly and domesticated or a wild animal that wants to kill you, ideally you should get in the car until it has eaten everything, including the checkered tablecloth. But remember not to lock the rest of the diners out if you don’t want the dog to eat more than your lawyer can justify. Translated by Joel Dalmau.

"1","G hostbusters: Frozen Empire opened in theaters on March 22 and, despite mixed reviews, quickly became that weekend’s box office champ with a $45 million profit . To date , it’s garnered $78.5 million domestically , bringing collective franchise revenue over the billion- dollar threshold and proving that the 40-year-old brand is still a crowd-pleaser after five successful films. Frozen Empire not only reunites the Ghostbusters franchise with the Reitman family — Jason Reitman, whose late father, Ivan, directed the original 1984 film and Ghostbusters II , co-wrote Frozen Empire’s script with director Gil Kenan — but also brings back most of the characters introduced in the first film: Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts), and Walter Peck (William Atherton). The film also reintroduces the family members of Egon Spengler (the character played by the late Harold Ramis in the flagship film) who were first seen in Ghostbusters: Afterlife , including Egon’s daughter, Callie (Carrie Coon); Callie’s romantic interest, Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd); and Callie’s children, Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) and Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) . Frozen Empire is enjoying success at the box office because it targets two distinct audiences. Gen Xers and young boomers who were fans of the original film and Ray Parker Jr.’s catchy theme song are drawn to the theaters from a sense of nostalgia, while the presence of young ghostbusters like Phoebe and Trevor appeals to families and young adults. The film’s marketing team went after both of these groups with an $80 million global campaign that partnered with brands like Liberty Mutual, Mercedes-Benz, Cheetos, Hasbro, and Timberland, among others. The marketing even targeted young gamers by teaming up with a company to create a version of a game in which characters who follow a “themed course” can “morph” into a ghostbuster. The efforts to expand beyond a Gen X audience were clearly successful. Deadline reports that, according to EntTelligence , a telecommunication company that tracks film attendance, 54 percent of the ticket purchases on Saturday, March 23, were for shows before 5 p.m. — an indicator of family attendance — with 56 percent of the audience under the age of 35. The Ghostbusters reboot resonates with the movie-watching public because it has a moral compass, reinforces family values, and remains devoid of wokeness. That the Spengler family continues the work of Egon sends a message about the importance of knowing our family history and contributing to its future legacy. Like its predecessors, Frozen Empire illustrates the triumph of good over evil with the ghostbusters defeating the nefarious creatures who threaten New York City and the human race at large. Seventeen- year-old McKenna Grace delivers the film’s standout performance. The young actress, who received a Critics’ Choice Movie Award for her role as a 7-year- old child prodigy in Gifted (2017) , has successfully bridged the screen transition from child to young adult with her sensitive, nuanced portrayal of Phoebe Spengler. Sporting the glasses that Harold Ramis’ Egon wore 40 years ago and a short dark curly wig to hide her blonde hair, Phoebe is the keeper of flame, the scientist of the future. Grace delivers a performance that is a mélange of meticulous researcher and awkward insecure adolescent. We witness Phoebe’s moral dilemma when she befriends the ghost of a teenage girl named Melody (Emily Alyn Lind) and is faced with the decision of assisting or extinguishing her. We also experience her proverbial journey from innocence to maturity when she realizes that Melody has tricked her into committing an action with potentially lethal consequences. Reitman and Kenan are to be commended for imbuing Phoebe with the complicated emotions of an adolescent who is intellectually light years ahead of her peers but emotionally still a child. It is refreshing that the two writers did not bow to present-day social warriors by labeling the bookish, tomboyish young character as “genderfluid.” In addition to its nuanced portrayal of a teenager, Frozen Empire addresses the archetypical passing of the mantle from the elder statesmen to the next generation. The film includes a touching exchange between Ray (Aykroyd) and Winston (Hudson) in which Winston tells Ray that the time has come for him to hang up his proton pack and leave the ghostbusting to the next cohort of scientists. To that point, much has been made of Bill Murray’s brief screen time in his role as Peter Venkman, with reviewers speculating that the actor wanted limited involvement with the production. From a plot perspective, however, the diminished role of the character makes sense: Peter realizes that he is no longer an action hero, and so does Bill Murray. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is not only a nostalgic exploration but also an upbeat, funny, action- packed film that salutes traditional values, punishes the villains, and celebrates the citizen heroes who defend and protect our civilization. It’s well worth the watch.

"1","Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is taking pages from Vladimir Putin’s book by doubling down on repression to secure a victory in upcoming elections. Some of his persecuted opponents are taking refuge in the Argentine embassy that is under siege by his Cuban trained security services in an evolving crisis that could turn into another serious foreign policy embarrassment for Biden, who recently eased economic sanctions on Venezuela on the advice of his NSC officials believing he could trust Maduro. Before the ink was dry on a U.S. brokered agreement signed with much pomp and circumstance in Barbados last October, pledging all kinds of electoral guarantees to Venezuela’s opposition, an elaborate legalistic process was underway to prevent the main opposition presidential candidate, María Corina Machado, from getting on the ballot following the authoritarian template being applied by leftist governments globally. (READ MORE: Iran Makes Inroads in Latin America ) Last week, Venezuela’s regime filed unspecified “conspiracy” charges against all her senior staff, two of whom got snatched by Maduro’s goon squads while six of them made it to Argentina’s diplomatic mission. Electricity to the embassy has since been cut and Argentine President Javier Milei is struggling to get a military team into Venezuela to protect the grounds surrounded by Maduro’s security unit SEBIN who are also cutting the water supply intermittently. “When it does come out it’s dirty” an Argentine security official told The American Spectator . “It’s heartening to see Argentina taking a principled stand to protect those Maduro and his regime have targeted in its multifront attack on the opposition’s increasingly futile efforts to give Venezuelans real choice in the July elections,” says Dr. Evan Ellis, Latin America specialist at the U.S. Army War College. Machado was trying to arrange for a prominent academic to replace her on the ticket when Maduro decapitated her political organization to pressure the opposition into accepting a quiet, little known ex-ambassador as the rival candidate. Maduro Should Be Held Accountable Milei has been accusing Venezuela of being a “communist” and “terrorist” state since his inauguration last year. But other governments are being “timid” and “soft” in criticizing Venezuela’s “criminal violation of international agreements,” said ex-Colombian president Ivan Duque on CNN. The U.S. State Department has expressed “ concerns ” over the regime’s election interference while President Lula da Silva of Brazil and current Colombian President Gustavo Petro echo American platitudes. “Maduro should be condemned by the Organization of American States and the United Nations,” says Duque, who fears that the lack of international reaction to his brutal fix on Venezuela’s elections renders Machado vulnerable to “extra official capture” or even “assassination.” The Barbados agreements by which Maduro was supposed to allow competitive elections under international supervision, were largely negotiated by NSC Latin America officer Juan Gonzales, who quietly resigned from the White House a month ago, after it had become apparent that Maduro had no intention of honoring the agreement, which had allowed his regime to vastly increase its oil revenues in recent months. “Gonzales was much taken in by the Venezuelans … getting flown around in private jets,” a U.S. State Department source told The American Spectator . “He made it clear from the start that the administration wanted to scuttle maximum pressure sanctions [imposed by former President Donald Trump].” His replacement, Dan Erikson, is expected to recommend “some degree of policy change” when the Barbados agreements officially come up for review on April 18. But Maduro has already doubled his oil profits which rose from $12 billion to $20 billion in 2023 . The easing of sanctions that were supposedly tailored to allow Chevron to purchase Venezuelan oil for U.S. refineries in a “debt repayment” scheme, ended up being negotiated in ways that also permitted European and Indian oil companies to load up on Venezuelan crude oil in straight dollar transactions that had been banned by Trump. (READ MORE from Arostegui: The Venezuela Template Against Democracy ) Similar to how the Biden administration’s roll back of sanctions on Iran has allowed the radical Islamic regime to strengthen itself politically and militarily in the Middle East, the easing of Venezuelan sanctions is helping Maduro expand his influence in Latin America, where he keeps Cuba’s dictatorship afloat with free oil shipments supplying 30 percent of the island’s energy needs. Bolivian international lawyer Christian Barrientos also sees a link between the recent repression unleashed in Venezuela and efforts by Bolivia’s socialist government to dismantle election integrity safeguards. Maduro Pressures Guyana In recent days, Bolivia’s MAS party government of President Luis Arce Gómez filed unspecified criminal charges against an engineer of the cyber security firm Ethical Hackers, Edgar Villegas , who uncovered an attempt by previous MAS President Evo Morales to manipulate the vote in 2019 elections. An audit he conducted for the Organization of American States presented clear evidence that results were being electronically altered through outside servers connected to Bolivia’s electoral system while the votes were counted, leading Bolivia’s supreme court to denounce “election fraud” and oust Morales. Last week, Villegas was suddenly charged with “instigation to commit a crime” without the government saying what the intended crime was. “We see a clear pattern by repressive leftist governments to perpetuate themselves in power through the pre-emptive elimination of any possible election challenge” says Barrientos. Maduro’s growing regional influence may also give him leverage on neighboring Guyana where he is pushing territorial claims on the country’s oil producing region of Essequibo where Exxon Mobil is currently undertaking a major exploration project to tap its vast energy reserves. About 6000 Venezuelan troops were mobilized to the border with Guyana last December following a propaganda blitz by Maduro asserting historical rights on the territory based on a border dispute dating back to when Guyana was a British colony. (READ MORE: Disintegration: King of the Jungle , Episode 9 ) Recent satellite imagery indicates that his military remain deployed along the border where they appear to be building bases. Venezuela’s armed forces equipped with sophisticated Russian hardware including S-300 missiles, Su-25 fighter aircraft, T-72 tanks as well as Iranian made Peykaap missile boats, dwarf Guyana’s small army. Britain has sent a frigate to the area and high-level Pentagon officials have visited to discuss a buildup of Guyana’s armed forces. It’s doubtful that Venezuela would launch an all-out invasion, but its Russian and Iranian supported military could mount low-intensity insurgent operations in Essequibo threatening oil production in the area, according to former Navy SEAL Officer Erik Prince who heads the private security firm Academi, (formerly Blackwater). He said in recent TV interview that Venezuela is infiltrating undercover teams possibly including Colombian FARC guerrilla veterans. Ellis says that Maduro could be aiming at extorting protection money from oil operators going into the region. Intelligence analysts also say that Venezuela is collaborating with Iran to set up terrorist cells throughout the hemisphere. Argentine security officials worry about possible retaliation against Milei for his support to the Venezuela’s opposition and ongoing investigations into Hezbollah’s local network. An Iranian Boeing 707 linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, which had been flying regularly between Venezuela and Argentina, was grounded in Argentina at the request of the FBI in 2022. Argentine authorities resisted handing the plane over the U.S. authorities until Milei complied with the requisition order upon taking office."
"1","S o ubiquitous, and acceptable, is sports gambling these days that Clay Travis offers free prop bets for March Madness games on The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show . And it’s not only the successor to the great Rush Limbaugh pushing gambling on the nation’s most revered — and popular — conservative talk show. It’s the royal family of football, the Mannings, plumping Caesars Sportsbook in ads that seemed to flood the airwaves leading up to Super Bowl LVI. And it’s household-name athletes like Mike Tyson, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal, Jerry Rice, and Wayne Gretzky, and big-screen staples like Ben Affleck and Jamie Foxx, using their names and reputations to sell sports betting. Sports channels feature shows where odds and gambling bets are the sole topic of discussion. One’s daily TV viewing is interrupted continually by ads for betting aps. Why, the major American sports leagues themselves — the NFL, the NBA, MLB, the NHL — all have signed big-money partnerships with betting platforms. ESPN has its own online sportsbook . I wonder if anyone foresaw this gambling bonanza 50 years ago when Americans still had to trek to the Nevada desert to legally play the tables or the machines. Or, more to the point, even six years ago, when the Supreme Court threw open the sportsbook doors by striking down the Amateur Protection Act, making sports betting legal in the states. Sports betting has exploded since that 2018 decision, as 38 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have legalized sports betting of some sort, although not all have enacted it. And, amazingly, in those six years, all the dangers of sports betting drummed into our heads over these many decades have mysteriously been memory-holed, vanished like the money you put on that huge point spread that shrinks radically during garbage time. With a wave of the justices’ hands, the age-old dangers of game fixing and point shaving and general corruption by unsavory influences have all gone away. So strong has been the push for legal sports gambling that scandal and corruption have been washed, and wished, into oblivion. Sports gambling offers no threat to the integrity and competitive purity of sports, we are told, because, well, the gambling people say so. And besides, there is just so much money to be made by all in WagerWorld, and which state in its right mind is not going to spread its arms to embrace the millions flowing to it in gambling taxes? Nothing shady to see here, folks. Certainly no corruption. Well, the last year or so has not been kind to the pushers of sports betting. We as a society are up to our necks in sports gambling scandals. It turns out what was up until a couple of decades ago illegal — and, since the dawn of recorded history, immoral — does carry with it some dirty baggage. Problems With Prop Bets The latest contretemps involves prop bets on college athletes. Prop bets — proposition bets — are wagers on aspects of the game unrelated to the final score. For example, some actual bets from the Elite Eight games last weekend include: Will Purdue’s Zach Edy score 22.5 points against Tennessee? Will North Carolina State’s D.J. Burns dish out more than 2.5 assists in the Duke game? But they can be even more atomistic, like an over/under on how many three-pointers player A will make in a game. Such bets are legal in many states, and the president of the NCAA, Charlie Baker, who wants a nationwide ban on them, worries that athletes will be harassed for failing to deliver on prop bets. Baker expressed his worry in January : All that chatter about who’s playing, who’s not playing. Who’s sore, who’s not sore. What’s going on with the team you’re playing? What do you think your chances are? Which is just classic chatter, where — in a world where people are betting — takes on a whole new consequence. More to the point of prop betting, Baker limned the real-world dangers the following month, as reported in the Wall Street Journal : You literally could have certain situations where somebody just says, “Look, you’re my friend. We’ve been friends a long time. I lost 500 bucks last week because you didn’t play well. And I still love you, but I’ve got to make rent next week. All I need you to do is miss your first two free throws.” Could this happen? Sure. Does it happen? We can only guess. But the fact that it could happen showcases the potential of corruption in prop betting. You, the innocent bettor, never know if those free throws were missed on purpose. San Diego State athletic director J.D. Wicker said players, who are out and about on campus, attending class and so forth, are ripe for pressure from bettors: [T]here’s a lot more opportunity for one of them to be pressured, for them to have something negative happen because maybe they miss the free throw or they miss the over the under, all those types of things. According to CBS Sports : “A NCAA survey from last September showed 10% of respondents were aware of an athlete being harassed in person or online. The number of Division I athletic departments that faced a gambling issue or problem tripled from 2019 to 2023.” Already a potential prop betting scandal has erupted in the pro game, where Toronto Raptor center Jontay Porter is being investigated for his possible part in two lucrative prop bets. In two games, in which he exited early or played minimally, millions of dollars came in on the under in prop bets involving him, turning those prop bets into the most lucrative NBA wagers on those particular days. Sam Quinn wrote at CBS Sports: But the Porter situation, pending the results of the investigation, has a chance to spiral into one of the worst sports betting scandals since legalization began to spread in 2018. According to ESPN, the NBA is investigating the integrity of games Porter himself participated in. If they do indeed find evidence that he either made bets against himself or had involvement with anyone that bet against him, that would represent a first since the sports gambling boom started six years ago. “People were trying to do whatever they could to bet Jontay Porter props [in the first of the two games],” one source told ESPN. “And then, just a few days ago, the same thing. We had a bunch of people trying to bet under for more.” Multiple Scandals Apart from prop bets, recent times have not been kind to the gambling cause. The Temple University men’s basketball team is being investigated by U.S. Integrity, a gambling watchdog group, for “suspicious wagering activity” on its games. In one game, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) was a narrow favorite over the Owls, but during game day, that number ballooned to 8 points, closing at game time at 7. No injuries or other factors were at play to affect such a large point swing, which aroused the notice of investigators. UAB won the game, 100–72. Since that loss, Temple has been 5–0 against the spread. Last year, University of Alabama baseball coach Brad Bohannon was fired amid suspicious activity. According to Sports Illustrated , he allegedly gave crucial information about Alabama’s starting pitcher for a game against Louisiana State University to another party, who promptly tried to bet $100,000 on LSU. The bet raised suspicion, as that particular game had generated virtually no action prior to his bet. Additionally, the amount of the wager far exceeded the sportsbook’s house limit, which also set off alarms. In the Hawkeye State, athletes from both the University of Iowa and Iowa State University have been embroiled in gambling controversies lately, accused of betting while underage; betting on games, including on their own teams; and betting under false names. Charges were dropped on four athletes because law enforcement used illegal means to monitor their betting activity, but over a dozen college kids have pled guilty to underage gambling. The most high-profile sports betting scandal of the day has a different flavor. It involves bookies and gambling debts in a state, California, that has not yet legalized sports gambling. And it involves Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani, baseball’s biggest star and the highest-paid athlete in American sports history. The modern-day Babe Ruth — excellent pitcher and fantastic hitter, like Ruth — is embroiled in a betting scandal stemming from his longtime interpreter taking money from Ohtani’s bank account and sending it to an alleged bookie. The question is whether the translator stole the money from Ohtani’s account, or whether Ohtani was paying the debts for the translator. The case is ongoing, and facts about it are fluid. Ohtani has denied involvement in the controversy. Protecting Sports Those critical of legal gambling are usually characterized as bluenoses, cheek-sucking prudes who want to take the fun out of everything. A better characterization is that they simply want to protect the purity and integrity of the games they love. There are myriad ways for athletes to negatively affect the games they are playing — point shaving, tanking, faking injury, throwing the game. It is difficult to impossible to keep corruption out of sports when gambling is legal and widespread and encouraged by media and society. READ MORE from Tom Raabe: WTF?! Why All the Swear Words?

"1","Last month the House of Representatives advanced bipartisan legislation requiring Chinese company ByteDance to sell its widely used video app TikTok, or have it banned in the United States. Meanwhile, former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced he would assemble a group to purchase the app. However, the Congressional legislation is running into some sharp opposition. The Washington Post reported that a coalition of “small-business owners, educators, activists and young people who use TikTok were scrambling to respond … with many arguing that it plays an increasingly crucial role in the national economy and American public life.” (READ MORE: The Beginning of the End of TikTok? ) That “increasingly crucial role” is exactly the problem. The CCP Controls TikTok Algorithm This recreational app has grown into a national security issue. On one hand, there is the digital privacy angle. Whatever goes onto TikTok goes directly to the Chinese Communist Party. They can access all your posts and information; so if you plan a future in US government service you might want to remember who has been watching you. Your images and other data will be filed in Beijing’s biometric databases, and the CCP can copy all the user info you load in — name, email, phone number, credit cards, and whoever you are linked to. So TikTok — like most apps, frankly — is voluntary spyware. Then there is the algorithm, which ByteDance won’t sell or even allow anyone to view. This could mean bargain pricing for a potential app buyer. But the reason why China keeps the algorithm under wraps is because this is how the People’s Republic of China (PRC) conducts political warfare against the United States. (READ MORE: Xi Jinping’s Persecution of Chinese Christians ) Communist influence operations against the U.S. are nothing new , but the information age and rise of social media platforms gave the CCP new means of pushing out its messaging. In 2021, a RAND study detailed the use of foreign social media by the Chinese military to carry out what they call “cognitive domain operations” involving “subliminal messaging, deep fakes, overt propaganda, and public sentiment analysis.” So TikTok is just the latest and most insidious evolution of this technique. The algorithm is a product of the political warfare that the CCP is waging on this country. Like any algorithm TikTok makes content recommendations tailored to each user, deciding what users will see based on a variety of criteria such as engagement, user interactions, video information like captions and hashtags, device and account settings like country and language, and how long you watch a given video. But it can also push out or suppress messages and images based on other factors, including whatever the CCP wants you to see — or not see. ByteDance, the company behind TikTok, is heavily influenced by the communist party. A study by the Jamestown Foundation found that “a party committee micromanages ByteDance’s operations and decision-making.” The party committee engages “in activities to reinforce party loyalty among its members, including oath-taking ceremonies where employees swear to uphold and never betray the Party’s agenda.” Committee secretary Zhang Fuping “emphasized the importance of the party committee taking a proactive and elevated role in oversight, ensuring that algorithmic decisions [emphasis added] are in accordance with Xi Jinping Thought and promote ‘socialist core values.’” These algorithmic decisions are manifested in different ways inside and outside the PRC. TikTok’s Chinese Cousin Is Heavily Censored Douyin, the domestic Chinese version of TikTok, also owned by ByteDance, promotes socially useful messages about family, hard work, education, intelligence, and loyalty to the Communist Party. These are meant to enhance Chinese national strength, growth and cohesion. And just to make sure, this is all done under the watchful eye of the internal security services. In 2018, Zhang Hong-ye, deputy director of the Cyber Security Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, said that “the influence of short videos on society continues to increase, and the central and local party and government organs have opened official government affairs accounts on the Douyin platform to carry out positive energy propaganda in the form of videos, igniting the enthusiasm of all walks of life to transmit positive energy, and has won the general resonance and full affirmation of netizens and social public opinion.” (READ MORE: Hong Kong Affords a Glimpse of the Future for Taiwan ) In general, the Chinese internet has long been heavily censored. Beijing pioneered the technology of internet censorship, and the Great Firewall bans popular social media like Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter, all of which are American purveyors of negative energy, And most recently Douyin banned AI stating “it is prohibited to use generative artificial intelligence technology to create or publish content that violates scientific common sense, engages in fraud, and spreads rumors.” This is all intended to promote a vision of China’s future as a growing and prospering country under the wise leadership of chairman Xi Jinping. Meanwhile the TikTok algorithm in this country promotes the strange, the bizarre, the controversial and divisive. A Rutgers study from December 2023 showed that highly divisive topics like Black Lives Matter, abortion, and all things Trump, are heavily promoted, while matters the CCP would rather we not think about like the Tiananmen Square massacre, Hong Kong protests, Falun Gong, Tibetan independence, or the genocide of the Uyghurs, are downgraded or censored. Leaked TikTok moderation guidelines from 2019 showed this is intentional, not incidental. A study in Taiwan found Tiktok users tend to have more pro-Chinese views. Other studies showed TikTok spreading violent and sometimes false imagery from Ukraine and the Gaza War. In response, TikTok restricted access to the tool analysts were using to conduct these studies. ByteDance and the PRC want to keep the TikTok algorithm hidden is because it is toxic and destabilizing by design. The Marketplace Can Handle Replacing TikTok Replacing TikTok should not be that difficult. Just ban it and let the marketplace replace it with something American owned and operated. But even a home-grown social medium may not be operated in a way that’s good for this country. Any such app could well echo the same type of destructive, divisive messaging that we see coming from communist China. Look at Google and its woke Gemini AI image generator , specifically tailored to produce the kind of output that Chairman Xi would absolutely love. Google and likeminded progressives are a wrecking crew for American culture. Simply banning TikTok won’t root out the generational harm that the march through the institutions has done to America. Some question whether the U.S. government should be involved in banning an app. They argue that our commitment to free speech should be paramount. That is a valid concern. But there is no reason why the American commitment to free speech and free enterprise should allow a foreign entity operating under the influence of the Chinese Communist Party, or for that matter any other malign foreign actors, to freely exercise their mission to destroy our country. Our adversaries are long term planners executing a strategy to weaken and destroy our freedoms and our nation. They will use every tool at their disposal to achieve these ends. They firmly believe that they are on the right side of history, that time is on their side, and the clock is ticking. You might wonder if that is why they called it TikTok. James S. Robbins is Dean of Academics at the Institute of World Politics in Washington, D.C."
"2","During his time atop the Republican Party, Donald Trump’s lifetime habits of fraud and grifting have fused seamlessly with conservative politics. In 2024 alone, Trump debuted $399 gold sneakers emblazoned with the American flag, sold a $60 “God Bless the USA” Bible endorsed by singer Lee Greenwood, and convinced millions to purchase stock in Truth Social’s unprofitable parent company. Trump is often treated as a political hijacker who rerouted the Republican Party to his own self-interested ends. Surely that’s part of the truth. But at the same time, there’s a decent case that, when it comes to grifting, his hijacking attempt could only succeed due to the conservative movement’s ingrained scammy tendencies. From paranoid anti-Communist lecture series in the 1950s to crowdfunded birther investigations to Alex Jones peddling fake coronavirus cures , there’s a long and storied history of elites peddling fear and paranoia to make a buck. The problem has gotten so bad that, in the past several years, many prominent conservatives have publicly bemoaned the omnipresence of grifts in the conservative ranks. But where did this culture come from, and how important was it to Trump’s rise? These questions are at the heart of The Longest Con , a forthcoming book on the history of right-wing scams and frauds. The book’s author, Joe Conason, is a veteran New York journalist; he personally knew some of the key figures in the scammy right’s history, like mobbed-up lawyer and Trump mentor Roy Cohn . Conason locates the origins of the grift tradition with Joe McCarthy, whose anti- Communist campaign proved that paranoid lies could be a ticket to popularity on the grassroots right. Cohn, who worked for McCarthy, figured out a way to transmute that popularity into profit: exploiting fears of Communism to, among other things, finance a lavish trip to Europe. Donald Trump, right, with Roy Cohn at the Trump Tower opening in 1983. Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images “The template for right-wing grift ... followed in McCarthy’s wake,” Conason writes. “By creating such an atmosphere of utter dread — and then promising that they alone could prevent America’s doom — [hucksters] induced thousands of suckers to hand over large wads of cash.” As the conservative movement grew, the grifts grew with it. Conason pinpoints Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential run as a key turning point. The campaign produced a massive mailing list that scammers could solicit for donations to alleged political causes that mostly lined their own pockets. When these “direct mail” scams proved immensely profitable, they expanded, normalizing an ethos of grifting on the right that, ultimately, would reach its apogee in Donald Trump. I spoke to Conason about this fascinating, hidden-in-plain-sight history: about how it started, why it succeeded, how it paved the way for Trump’s rise, and whether there’s any equivalent grifting culture on the American left. What follows is a transcript of that conversation, edited for length and clarity. Zack Beauchamp So Roy Cohn. He starts his career as this corrupt New York lawyer, bridging the worlds of Democratic politics, high society, and mafiosos. When does he make the jump to the right, and how important is he in the rise of conservative grift culture? Joe Conason I think pretty important. The people who tolerated him for the longest time — William Safire, very respectable, Bill Buckley, very respectable. These people, they knew what Roy was. They knew he was a crook and a con man and a liar and a cheater, and yet, that was okay. To me, that was a sign of something very wrong in conservative culture, looking back, that that guy would be not only tolerated but celebrated. As I say in the book, they would have big parties to celebrate him. Ronald Reagan had Roy to the White House, and when Roy was sick, they bent the rules to get him treatment that nobody knew about, even though he was pretending not to have AIDS. Roger Stone, who became very powerful in the conservative movement, was a protégé of Roy’s. He had some kind of charm or attraction or something for these conservatives, who otherwise I think would’ve told you that they themselves would never contemplate doing the kinds of things that Roy did, which is basically stiffing the IRS for 20 years or 30 years or however long it was, and not paying his creditors, which is a thing that Trump seems to have picked up from him. He was a rogue, and I think [they thought] “Oh, he was a roguish fellow. Wasn’t he fun?” But at some point, you catch a little of the disease yourself. And I think the willingness to overlook Roy’s deep, deep corruption was — let’s just say it was a bad sign. I can’t tell you that that caused anything, but it was not a good sign about the moral character of that movement in its earliest days. Zack Beauchamp Let’s talk about the expansion of this, because obviously, grifting in the conservative movement isn’t just a Roy Cohn story — though he was a pioneer in some of the earliest versions of these ways of grifting, about selling fear of communism. Joe Conason In the aftermath of McCarthy, the impulse and the marketability of anti-communism as an ideology did not go away. To turn it into a business, you would sell lectures. There were a series of them that I profiled in the book that had different ways of marketing a hysterical version of anti-communism to middle- class and upper-middle-class people who were terrified. They would pay a lot to go to a lecture, they’d buy lecture tapes, they would buy books. It could cost them hundreds of dollars, which in 2024 dollars is thousands of dollars. This got so bad that J. Edgar Hoover — who was considered the greatest authority on communism on the right, had a whole apparatus to root out communism in the country — was appalled by these people. I found communications between Hoover and his deputies about some of these individuals they thought of as grifters and con men and crooks, and they investigated them. That’s how bad it was: J. Edgar Hoover thought “these guys are crooks and they’re giving anti-communism a bad name.” Zack Beauchamp During the Cold War period, how central was the grifting and con man stuff to the conservative movement? The standard history is that, sure, maybe there were some cranks on the side, but Ronald Reagan and William F. Buckley defined a new and principled way of thinking about American politics. Your book offers an alternative history, positioning the profiteering and swindling as something that grew with the post-war conservative movement. Just how deeply intertwined is the grift with the more committed side of the movement? Joe Conason What I would say is that the grifting side — the side that doesn’t really believe in anything very much except its own enrichment — has grown. It wasn’t necessarily the dominant portion in the beginning at all. But there’s a point in the book where Richard Viguerie discovers direct mail and how he can use the Goldwater movement [in 1964] to build a huge direct mail industry. I’d say that was a turning point. Richard Viguerie was a guy who had been brought into the direct mail business with the Buckley crowd — Young Americans for Freedom, which was their central organization, aside from the National Review, for raising money. He realized that you could just ask people for money and they would give it to you. Zack Beauchamp You don’t even need to be selling them anything physical, right? That’s the innovation here, you just send them a mailer promising to fight for what they believed in. Joe Conason Yes. But the problem was that in order for that to be really effective on a national level, you needed lists of names. And lists of names of conservatives just didn’t exist until the Goldwater campaign in 1964. Viguerie realized that the donors to the Goldwater campaign comprised a national list of conservatives who would donate money. He said [it] was like a key to Fort Knox. It turned out he was right: Those people would give money. And it built from there. People who are giving you money don’t really know what you’re doing with the money. You’re telling them you’re doing this and that, and maybe you are and maybe you’re not. In many cases not, and they don’t have any way of knowing. What they know is that they have grievances and concerns that you’re addressing, or you’re telling them you’re addressing. They’re willing to give money to make themselves, I guess, feel better about that. Now, it took a while for it to take over. But once that starts, it was impossible to stop. It takes over a larger and larger portion of the conservative movement, to the point where we now have Trump. One of the reasons I wrote the book is you can see how, over time, this impulse to swindle and grift became a bigger and bigger part of conservatism. And the honest conservatism — the ideological and philosophical [principles], what they considered moral virtue — has been stripped away. Zack Beauchamp So you just jumped from Viguerie in the ’60s all the way forward to Trump in 2016. There’s a wealth of time during which this spreading happens. What are some of the key events in between, the ones that fueled the rise of right-wing grift culture? Joe Conason It takes different forms over time. One is the religious right: Jerry Falwell, the Moral Majority, Pat Robertson, the Christian Coalition. Now the Prosperity Gospel types who are around Trump, who are just straight-up grifters. That becomes a big element in it. Then you have the Reagan administration, which I describe as the most corrupt in history — up until Trump at least — in terms of the number of prosecutions and scandals. There were quite a few people who found ways to profit from government programs that they were supposedly going in there to end or reduce. One of the most interesting is Paul Manafort, who turns up much later as Trump’s campaign manager. James Watt was another. A Western conservative who supposedly was against big government, he was just finding ways to get paid off and almost went to prison for it . Then we come to the period just before Trump arises: the Tea Party and the birther movement. That too was a grift: There were certainly grifters getting people to give them money to prove that Obama shouldn’t be president or was not qualified to be president, but the lead figure in that was Trump. And so, logically, Trump becomes a force within the Republican Party, and meanwhile, the Republican Party is kind of losing its way in general and becomes very vulnerable to someone like him. Zack Beauchamp What I think is novel here in your book is seeing this history as laying a unique kind of pathway for Trump. You had these generations of people who built an expanding empire of profit grafted onto conservative ideology, and then Donald Trump comes along and he’s like, “Wait, I can just make the movement fully into that — an extension of my efforts at brand-building.” That’s a core part of what allows him to succeed in Republican politics: that brand-building and profiteering have already been built into it over the course of decades. Joe Conason I would point out that the creator of Trump, in a lot of ways, is Roger Stone, who’s been in the grifting business of conservatism for a really long time. Stone saw that Trump was a really outstanding possibility for the kind of politics that Roger represented, which was a hollow politics of demagoguery with more than a touch of racial paranoia and hate, and that could be perfectly flexible in terms of positions and issues and viewpoints and rhetoric. Roger got to know Trump during the first Reagan campaign through Roy Cohn. And he figured out this was a guy who had real potential. They had a model, a way of conducting themselves politically that was both effective on a certain segment of the public and highly profitable. They had thought about it for many years before Trump finally agreed to run for president. Trump was a perfect candidate [because] he had shown he would get involved in any kind of grift. He’d gotten involved in multilevel marketing. Trump University was a type of scam: the fake real estate investment seminar, which would get people to pay big money and promise them that they would make a lot of profit on real estate themselves. Trump had a perfect brand to get into, and so he did. Roger Stone and others around him realized, “Hey, this is our guy. We can capitalize all of this that’s been built in the past and discard anything that’s inconvenient about conservatism because who cares?” Zack Beauchamp So now, we get the leading Republican presidential candidate hawking multi-hundred-dollar sneakers and an America- themed Bible as a means of making money — a full integration of political party with scam ventures. There’s nothing like this level of mainstream hucksterism on the Democratic side, as far as I can tell. Joe Conason In writing the book, I went out and looked for examples of this on the blue side. I think people get swindled by all kinds of things all the time, whatever their politics are. Zack Beauchamp I think you have some pretty solid examples of people on the left in your introduction who have grifted liberals.

But there are certain themes on the right that seem to lend themselves to these kinds of crooked schemes. Roger Stone said long ago that one of his rules of politics is that hate triumphs over love in politics, that hate is the most saleable thing in politics.

"2","First, the bad news: Netflix’s new show Ripley , based on Patricia Highsmith’s immortal novel The Talented Mr. Ripley , is a snooze. It’s shot beautifully. Under the auspices of showrunner Steven Zaillian (the screenwriter for the movie Schindler’s List , among others) and Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Elswit, Ripley renders its exquisite Italian landscapes and architecture in gorgeous, sinister black and white. The camera is forever panning across a Caravaggio or a palazzo, leaving your eyes time to linger. Each frame is elegantly composed. Yet everything happening within those frames is so boring that it feels like a waste of beauty — not to mention a waste of a more than capable cast. Andrew Scott, who has been so charismatic and emotive in Fleabag and Sherlock and All of Us Strangers , plays Ripley with a careful detachment, as if he’s been warned not to try to make the audience feel anything. Likable Johnny Flynn ( Emma ., Lovesick ), in the less showy role of Ripley’s callow mark Dickie, has himself so reined in that it becomes difficult to understand why Ripley is so drawn to him in the first place. The spark between them that is meant to set the whole plot ablaze ends up feeble and barely visible. (It doesn’t help matters that both Scott and Flynn are over 40, making it difficult to buy them as the sort of just-out-of-college gallivanters whose worried parents might plausibly be keeping a too-close watch on them.) The biggest waste, though, is the waste of the story itself. Highsmith’s The Talented Mr. Ripley is a particularly stylish entry in a highly specific grouping of stories that are currently having a bit of a moment. Besides Netflix’s Ripley , last fall’s Saltburn launched a thousand internet arguments . Donna Tartt’s The Secret History remains the darling of the dark academia readers of TikTok . This is the genre I’ve started to call “striver gothic,” the stories of pretenders striving to make it among the careless and idle wealthy, even if they have to kill to do so. They are stories about how even for the smoothest operator, the sheer force of wanting can eat you alive. Highsmith’s The Talented Mr. Ripley is a perfect iteration of the striver gothic. Netflix’s Ripley does not stick the landing. Looking at the ways it falls apart can tell us a lot about why these stories appeal to us. Toward a working definition of “striver gothic” Striver gothic is a term I developed with my friend Kirsten Carleton to describe stories that pull from a specific set of tropes. Here are the basics: An outsider main character is desperate for inclusion in a rarified upper-class world. He (and this character usually is a he) is the striver, and it is his desire to ascend from the bourgeoisie to the upper class that powers the story. The upper class is represented in metonymy by a friend group or family with intense, almost cultish insider dynamics. Frequently their group dynamic was formed within the cloistered walls of a school, creating some overlap between this genre and dark academia. They are either Ivy League or Oxbridge — or they borrow the aesthetic. A country house or manor represents sanctuary, prize, and inclusion within the group. The main character is obsessed with the leader of the group, frequently with queer undertones: Do I want to be him, or do I want to be with him? Identities are doubled and doppelgängers abound. There will be at least one murder, committed either by the striver or by the group he is trying to infiltrate. The boundaries of this world are guarded fiercely, and any attempt to break them ends in death. The nonnegotiables of the striver gothic are a striver and a murder. Everything else you can fiddle with. For its part, in Netflix’s Ripley , Dickie, his girlfriend Marge, and his friend Freddie are the upper-class friend group that striver Tom longs to penetrate. In his attempt to get there, Tom murders Dickie and takes over his identity, then murders Freddie, too, to cover the whole thing up. Ripley doesn’t quite have a country house (Tom does briefly move into Dickie’s Italian country home, although he prefers city palazzos), but the rest of the tropes are all there. Tom doesn’t have to long for Dickie’s house when he can simply take over Dickie’s whole identity instead. Brideshead Revisited set the template for this genre. It is not a striver gothic in and of itself; it’s not gothic and it contains no murders. It is nonetheless a striver story, with middle-class Charles seduced into a corrupt and decadent wealthy world via his love for aloof, androgynous Sebastian and the enchanted realm they build together at Oxford in the 1920s. In some ways, all the striver gothic stories are attempts to play out the subtext of Brideshead , to bring its suppressed gay longings and its numbed wartime rages out into the light of day. That is in part what happens in The Secret History , perhaps the most complete entry in the genre. There, Richard the pretender makes his way into the rarified world of his college’s classics students by helping them commit and cover up a murder so that they’ll let him stay at their picturesque country lake house. In The Secret History , Richard’s desire for inclusion in the group crosses the line into sexual desire more than once, and the group’s aversion to anyone who betrays the aesthetics of their class is what turns them murderous. Meanwhile, Saltburn wears its derivative nature on its sleeve and straightforwardly places the action of Ripley into the setting of Brideshead . It’s a movie that cannot quite decide if it’s going to be a pastiche, a subversion, or a straight iteration of the striver gothic, which is part of why it’s such a mess. I haven’t made a conclusive list here. Tana French’s The Likeness and arguably Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca are both striver gothics with female strivers. The movie Bodies, Bodies, Bodies parodies the genre, and the most recent season of You sends the murderous Joe Goldberg into a Secret History -style world. Popular culture abounds with strivers. But Tom Ripley is unique. Where Brideshead ’s Charles is too earnest, Secret History’s Richard too opaque, and Saltburn ’s Oliver simply too psychologically improbable, Tom Ripley is endlessly, delightfully fascinating. That’s probably why people have told his story so many times. Tom Ripley is the ultimate striver Patricia Highsmith’s Tom Ripley is a man who is always hunting or being hunted. Highsmith drops us straight into Tom’s paranoid, obsessive head from her first page. Her novel opens with Tom fleeing from one bar to another, certain that he’s being followed by the police and that they’re going to arrest him for one of his many petty crimes of forgery and fraud. Tom’s right that he’s being followed, but his pursuer isn’t a police officer. He’s the father of Dickie Greenleaf, an old acquaintance of Tom’s, who thought he recognized Tom and wanted to come say hello. As soon as Tom understands this, he pivots effortlessly. He stops worrying about what his pursuer might have on him, and he starts thinking about what he might be able to get out of his pursuer. In this case, it turns out that Tom can get quite a lot out of Dickie’s father. Dickie, it develops, has been in Italy for years, refusing to come home to New York, no matter how much his parents beg him. With the gentlest of pushes from Tom, Dickie’s businessman father hits on the plan of having Tom go to Italy to persuade Dickie back home — all Tom’s expenses to be paid for on the Greenleaf dime. That’s how Tom Ripley works. He sees the world in a binary of hunter and hunted, target and prey, and always, he is determined to come out ahead. His philosophy is not to worry about the future because something always comes up, and as such, he burns his bridges merrily and without hesitation. It’s nothing new to Tom to have angry people after him, and someone new will always happen along whom he can use to get himself out of one bad situation and into a new one. There are a lot of sociopaths in literature, but Tom is a peculiar one, an intelligent man who acts almost purely on instinct. He is suave enough to grant the reader pleasure at his exquisite taste, but always wrong on one or two telling details that the truly wealthy observer will inevitably pick up on, marking him as a class pretender. He’s self-aware enough to be funny, but he’s emotionally obtuse enough to miss the subtext in half his conversations and to lie to himself about the other half. Tom’s contradictions, his combination of playfulness, methodical care, and murderous caprice, are part of what make The Talented Mr. Ripley stand out among its peers in the striver gothic. Tom is a striver among strivers, at once fiercely focused on his goals and incapable of considering them too closely. When Tom decides that what he wants, more than anything in the world, is to make Dickie like him, he doesn’t bother to consider closely what it is about Dickie that attracts him, whether he longs for Dickie’s wealth and easy lifestyle or whether he longs for Dickie’s love and admiration for their own sake. He simply identifies his target and acts to reach it. Why Ripley fails Netflix’s Ripley is the third major adaptation of Highsmith’s novel and, in some ways, the most faithful. It is also the weakest artistically. In 1960, the French director René Clément transformed Ripley into Plein Soleil , marketed in the US as Purple Noon . There, Tom becomes a suave and beautiful con artist, more Thomas Crown than Tom Ripley, and he murders his friend less out of frustrated desire than out of rage at his sadism. In Clément’s hands, the story is no longer striver gothic, but it is a sun-soaked and brutal piece of filmmaking. Probably the most successful adaptation is also the most famous: Anthony Minghella’s 1999 The Talented Mr. Ripley , with Matt Damon as Tom and Jude Law as Dickie. Minghella’s film doesn’t match entirely with Highsmith’s version of the characters. After Highsmith’s Tom murders Dickie, he falls asleep that night “happy, content, and utterly, utterly confident,” but Damon renders Tom a vulnerable sweetheart of a character who weeps as he kills. Moreover, while Highsmith’s Tom is utterly isolated, Minghella invents two new characters he can talk to, through which the audience can learn exactly what the enigmatic Mr. Ripley is thinking. Through those conversations, and through Minghella’s ecstatic camera as it pans over his beautiful actors on luminous Italian beaches, we can see exactly how Tom’s obsession with Dickie takes seed and blossoms, until he feels he has no choice but to murder in the face of Dickie’s rejection. Ripley is a straight adaptation. It contains barely a scene that does not appear in Highsmith’s book; hardly a scene that does appear in Highsmith’s book gets omitted. What gets left out is Tom’s sense of playfulness, the fun he finds in lying and deceiving. Where Highsmith’s Tom is prone to giggle fits when he thinks of his crimes, Zaillian’s stays sad-eyed and grim. Under Zaillian’s restrained touch, the emotional connections that drive Tom to kill are barely sketched in. Instead, we spend inordinate amounts of time watching him cover up his crimes: lugging bodies painfully and silently around and then scrubbing up the blood. Highsmith, too, pays attention to the details of Tom’s coverups. But she writes about those details with panache. She delights in the elegance and thoroughness of Tom’s work. She makes it glamorous. Zaillian makes it hard and dull and unpleasant. This is doubtless an emotionally accurate depiction of what it’s like to dispose of dead bodies, but who comes to Ripley for that? We come to Ripley for Tom Ripley himself. Tom’s flair, his playfulness, his social adroitness mixed with profound blindness regarding his own desires for human intimacy — these are the elements that make this subgenre compelling. One of the pleasures of the striver gothic is the deep ambiguity about why, exactly, the striver is working so hard to get in with the group he’s targeted. Is he doing it because he genuinely likes them? Or because he likes their lifestyle? By extension: Is the genre about how much we long for intimacy from the people we admire? Or is it about how much we long for their money and their beautiful things? Well, after all, asks Tom Ripley: Why can’t it be both? Will you help keep Vox free for all?

"1","M ore than 225 years ago, prominent English scholar and political economist Thomas Malthus made one of history’s most spectacularly wrong predictions: continuous population growth arising from human passions will imperil economic growth and lead to people living on a bare subsistence income. Whereupon, England’s Industrial Revolution swept over Albion and far beyond, bringing continuing material prosperity. This is despite the fact that the planetary population has increased roughly eightfold since Malthus’s 1798 An Essay on the Principle of Population . Technological progress arising from human ingenuity, capital formation, and expanded trade overcame the law of diminishing returns. But a virulently new anti-Malthusian phenomenon has arisen. The desire to have children has shrunk dramatically worldwide — to the point that population is starting to decline in populous countries like China and Japan, leading demographers to predict planetary population decline later in this century. Are humans going the way of other species like the dinosaurs, possibly from nuclear holocaust but maybe instead due to the changing economics of having children? Economists say that “the opportunity costs of having kids have risen,” and/or “the costs of preventing children have declined.” Some might even argue that conventional sex has lost its allure relative to new alternative uses of one’s limited time and resources on earth — why have sex when you can be watching Tik Tok with friends while mellowing on some mind-altering substance? (READ MORE from Richard K. Vedder: Why Labor Unions Won’t Save Higher Education ) If a nation’s “total fertility rate” (TFR) is below 2.1 (about two babies per adult woman) and there is no international population movement, its population will eventually start declining. The TFR is extraordinarily low in Asia — below 1.3 in such populous countries as China and Japan, where population is already falling. In the U.S. and most European countries, the rate is between 1.4 and 1.7. With the conspicuous exception of Sub-Saharan Africa and some small Asian countries, the world is just saying no to having many children. The modern world is increasingly rejecting the immediate and long-term satisfaction arising from pregnancies, having children, and raising families, searching for alternative forms of satisfaction. More women are putting their careers ahead of children, and innovations such as abortion pills are accelerating declining fertility. Religious beliefs glorifying family formation are also being weakened in this age of secularization. So what? Let’s look at just four implications for the U.S. First, the aging of the population implicit in low fertility materially increases the strain in dealing with a near bankrupt system of providing pensions and health care for a rapidly growing elderly population. The ratio of workers to non-workers is falling. It is likely just a matter of time when “retirement” for many comes at 70 or even later (this written by someone who is 83!). The monumental recent French battle over ending a standard 62 year retirement age is just the beginning of a much bigger fight internationally. Second, although the statistical evidence is somewhat mixed, by many measures Americans are not saving enough to provide for unanticipated financial needs. In large part public policies discourage savings. For example, why save for college if the federal government provides student loans that they likely will ultimately “forgive?” Why buy stocks if you eventually will have to pay high taxes on “capital gains” that are often fictitious because of continuing inflation? Additionally, annual trillion-dollar federal budget deficits raise the costs of servicing our increasing collective fiscal irresponsibility. Third, we will increasingly need to reallocate resources away from youth- oriented needs like schools towards elderly-oriented needs such as nursing homes, and hospitals, as octogenarians need dramatically more care than those who are younger. We will build more cruise ships and nursing homes, fewer schools. Recently declining college enrollments may continue. Fourth, demographic trends emphasize the need to reevaluate our policies regarding immigration— we need to encourage incoming highly productive young persons with skills to increase the ratio of workers to retirees and ease somewhat the burdens associated with aging. But instead of having two million unskilled individuals annually enter illegally across our southern border, why don’t we let at least that number of productive individuals buy their way into our vibrant labor market (via regular visa auctions), counteracting or at least delaying otherwise inevitable population decline? (READ MORE: Showdown at the Border ) Contra Malthus : The new threat to human well-being is not having too many babies but having too few, accompanying the huge risks arising from a growing number of narcissistic autocrats possessing nuclear weapons capable of creating a debacle similar to that decimating the dinosaurs. I think it is far more likely human stupidity and shortsightedness will do in the human race than global warming.

"1","P art of the divide and conquer aspect of history’s greatest social engineering project, the COVID “ panic-demic ,” was urging workers to stay home. Preferably masked, but whatever. But the panic is long over despite the heroic efforts of some to return to those “halcyon days” and desperate efforts to find a new microbe around which to build another panic, including even monkeypox, which rarely kills and is extremely hard to spread . Yet employers who insist that their telecommuting employees come back generally catch hell from the mainstream media. Microsoft Media, which you’ll note has the same MSM abbreviation as “mainstream media,” recently warned, “Forcing Workers Back to the Office is ‘Dinosaur Management’ — and Companies Risk Losing Out, Expert Says.” Actually, I consider being aligned with dinosaurs a compliment. Including that flying one the name of which I can’t spell. But just off the top of my dinosaur brain it seems to me that if companies want employees back, there’s probably a good reason. Afterall, it’s costly to provide office space and work station, even a cubicle with the various accoutrements and parking spaces, and so on. All other things being equal, it would seem preferable to have workers pay for that themselves. (READ MORE from Michael Fumento: The Buzz on ‘The Great Honey Bee Die-Off’ ) Yes, there can be advantages to remote working — as some conservative publications have noted. But generally speaking evidence indicates it can have severe negative effects for both employer and employee. Most recently the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology of the British Psychological Society says the telecommuting, overall, is mentally harmful. In so many words, the harm inflicted during lockdowns is to an extent still being perpetuated even though we are now free to roam and roam without a muzzle, even to the remarkable extent of going in either direction in supermarket aisles! This needs a bit of perspective. Loneliness is a growing epidemic in the United States, with about half of U.S. adults reporting measurable levels even before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a Surgeon General’s advisory report last year. It’s not just painful; it kills. Loneliness “is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke, depression, anxiety, and premature death,” said the report, “similar to that caused by smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day.” Men bear the brunt. Only 48 percent of men reported feeling satisfied with friendships, according to a May 2021 survey by the Survey Center on American Life ; only 1 in 5 men said they had gotten emotional support from a friend in the past week, compared with 4 in 10 women. And yes, it’s getting worse. Thus 15 percent of men today say they have no close friendships, a five-fold increase since 1990 . Naturally, a great place to not be alone is at work. Personally, since graduating law school I’ve enjoyed every job in an office (with the exception of the one I dubbed, “The Job from Hell.”) far more than telecommuting. Wife or no, I enjoyed the camaraderie of the office and the chance to bounce ideas off of people. And mind, if your boss is the proverbial pr**k, he can be one remotely as well. But lots of influential people think telecommuting, regardless of what the employer wants, is Just This Side of Heaven. Mainstream media’s position has perhaps a couple of explanations. The most benign is that virtually everyone in the media relies to some extent or completely on freelance work. It works for them . Less benign is that the MSM support any and all aspects of “The New Normal.” Certainly for some industries and many individual employees, remote work can be advantageous. But as we saw during the lockdowns, and more so in countries with harsher ones than in the U.S., all sorts of horribles arose from the lockdown isolation, including severe depression and anxiety , alcoholism and other drug use , stress , insomnia , depression , domestic violence , fatigue , and other disorders. Mind, some may have been related to anxiety over getting what often seemed portrayed as the worst disease ever, Covid itself. But clearly much of this was from isolation. Certainly the isolation of telecommuting is not as bad as that imposed by some lockdowns. In the country where I was living people were allowed out only three days a week and even then with a curfew and with not only masks but face shields to effectively make person-to-person interaction outside the home difficult or impossible. We also had to rub our feet on alcohol mats to prevent the dreaded shoe bottom- to-shoe bottom transmission. But it’s isolation nonetheless and post-COVID telecommuting has indeed been associated with causing mental problems or exacerbating pre-existing ones. Likewise for physical ones. (READ MORE: Why Do Conservatives Fear ‘Frankenflesh’? ) And surely a lot of people who think they prefer telecommuting have actually just become accustomed to it and need a shove back into the saddle. As to the “Dinosaur” article from Microsoft Media mentioned above, it relied on the lazy journalist’s ploy of building an argument around a single “expert” as chosen by the writer. (In recent years, this has fallen in popularity behind articles about a single TikTok video and more recently “We asked ChatGPT….” ) That one expert, Cary Cooper, is an organizational psychologist at the University of Manchester and author of “Remote Workplace Culture.” He told Business Insider that insistence on bringing employees back to the office was “appalling,” a symptom of antiquated management strategy, “dinosaur management of the highest disorder,” “micromanagement of the highest order,” and such employers “don’t understand the marketplace for talent.” “They’ll lose talent. And they won’t be able to recruit good people,” he said. “That brand is going to be tarnished,” he said. People will say ‘I’m not even going to apply for a job there because they want me in five days a week.” M ind, it’s Sir Cary Cooper, and neither I nor probably anybody reading this has been knighted. So we’ll give him that. But there’s nothing in his background to indicate he’s ever managed people and he’s not an economist; he’s a psychologist. Further, psychologists and psychiatrists are overwhelming left-wing. One survey of 23 medical disciplines found that while two-thirds of surgeons were registered Republicans, at the other end of the scale a mere 24 percent of psychiatrists were, just beating out one other type of medical professional — infectious disease specialists. Yes, the WHO and CDC types who want to rule the world through disease. Psychologists, without the discipline of medical school, are much more left- wing. An earlier survey found only 6 percent identified as conservative. Sometimes political inclination doesn’t matter. And sometimes it does. There are authoritarians on both political wings, but it was leftist authoritarians who urged the lockdowns and it follows that they will support any and all vestiges of the panicidemic , from muzzles (er, masks) to telecommuting. Leftists also tend to be against Big Business. So when employers say it’s more efficient to have workers actually show up, psychologists, being leftists, will tend to side against employers because … they’re employers. But what do the data show? A 2023 study by three economists at different institutions but published by Stanford found workers perceived their productivity was about 7 percent higher at home, while managers thought it was about 3.5 percent lower. In fact, the Stanford analysis of multiple studies found a 10 percent to 20 percent reduction in productivity. The global warming cabal is infamous for exclaiming, “It’s worse than we thought!” then later going silent when the prediction date comes and goes without change, much less disaster. But sometimes things truly are worse than we think. Again, there are lots of cases where telecommuting is a win for all sides and other cases. I happen to be on the other side of the planet from most of the people I write for, and 35-hour commutes are rather tiring and expensive to say the least. But ultimately, if the boss wants workers back, that’s pretty much the end of it. Do they have an agenda? Yes. It’s called “higher productivity.” And it happens to include the mental and physical health of their workers. (READ MORE: Biden’s Fuelish Hydrogen Giveaway ) Studies show even slave owners realized that maintaining the health of their unwilling workers was beneficial economically , often providing some health care for their slave investments, and employing doctors to check on slaves’ health and give them any needed medicine. Owners also established slave hospitals , as the health of slaves was essential to plantation economies. Granted that slavery is hardly ideal for mental health and there were certainly slave owners who sacrificed economic efficiency for sheer brutality. And here goes: For the record I am not praising the institution of slavery. Nor do I eat babies.) Call your boss a “slavemaster” if you will, but he does have a pecuniary interest in your well-being. Those counseling a New Normal of telecommuting have an agenda, as well. It’s just not quite as obvious.

"1","WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump has a new cause, “migrant crime,” and a new slogan, “Stop Biden’s Border Bloodbath,” as he noted during a speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It doesn’t take a pollster to see why. Just turn on cable news and watch the frequent skirmishes at the southwest border. You quickly realize that U.S. immigration enforcement is outnumbered and under- supported. Over Easter weekend, a clash between migrants and Border Patrol agents along the Rio Grande made the news. Not so much because the Texas Department of Public Safety charged some 220 people, according to the El Paso Times , but because Magistrate Judge Humberto Acosta ordered them released on their own recognizance. (READ MORE from Debra J. Saunders: Who Put Marjorie Taylor Greene In Charge? ) President Joe Biden has made it clear that he’s fine with keeping migrants in the country when they don’t qualify for asylum, so illegal border crossers behave accordingly. They know time is on their side. Rather than stop the surge, the Biden White House is focused on blaming Republicans for not passing a bipartisan immigration bill. Everyone knows that progressive politics and border enforcement don’t mix. You don’t have to buy Trump’s rhetoric — it’s just plain gratuitous when the former president refers to criminal illegal migrants as “animals” — to be concerned that American generosity is being pushed to the limit. Those coming to the United States looking for jobs and an improved quality of life unwittingly serve as shields for cartels and repeat criminals looking for easy targets. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy research for the pro-enforcement Center for Immigration Studies, warned that America is experiencing “historic levels of illegal migration.” Many new arrivals have evaded the Border Patrol and haven’t been screened. We don’t know who they are. Biden can’t escape the story. During his State of the Union address, the president mentioned Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student murdered in February. A Venezuelan migrant has been charged with her death. In Michigan, Trump also spoke of Ruby Garcia, 25, of Grand Rapids, who was killed in March. Her boyfriend, a Mexican migrant who was deported in 2020 yet still managed to return to the United States, reportedly confessed to the crime. Trump won the White House in 2016 after he seized on the 2015 shooting death of San Franciscan Kate Steinle by a repeat offender from Mexico. That awful crime put San Francisco’s “sanctuary city” status in the spotlight — and it was not a good look. Vaughan told me the U.S. border is “wide open”; career criminals know that “they can get through illegally without being detected and live here and hide here. The open border has attracted criminals from all over the hemisphere.” (READ MORE: Showdown at the Border ) If Vaughan is right, America is becoming South America’s South America.

"1","“L earn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be his world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow,” wrote Mary Shelley in her 19th century masterpiece Frankenstein . Would that the militant atheists of the 21st century had heeded her words, for they have brought to life a monster of their own. Famed atheist and self-styled intellectual Richard Dawkins shared in a recent interview that he was “horrified” to find that Oxford Street in London had lit up its public signs and displays to celebrate the Muslim fasting period called Ramadan, just days before Easter Sunday. “I have to choose my words carefully: If I had to choose between Christianity and Islam, I’d choose Christianity every single time,” Dawkins declared, expressing concern over the thousands of Muslim mosques being constructed across the U.K. He added, “It seems to me to be a fundamentally decent religion, in a way that I think Islam is not.” The aging author of The God Delusion — somewhat surprisingly, perhaps — frankly declared, “I do think we are culturally a Christian country. I call myself a cultural Christian.” He explained: I’m not a believer, but there is a distinction between being a believing Christian and a cultural Christian. I love hymns and Christmas carols and I sort of feel at home in the Christian ethos, and I feel that we are a Christian country in that sense. … So I call myself a cultural Christian and I think it would be truly dreadful if we substituted any alternative religion. What Dawkins perhaps fails to realize and certainly refuses to confess is that his entire life’s work has been spent doing just that: substituting Christianity for an alternative religion, relativistic atheism. Now that Dawkins and his ilk have had some success in their efforts, they find themselves rather terrified of the godless, amoral world that they have helped create. Professor Richard Dawkins, meet Doctor Victor Frankenstein. (READ MORE from S.A. McCarthy: We Are an Easter People ) In Shelley’s 1818 work of fiction, the eponymous ambitious young scientist succeeds in realizing the goal with which he has become almost maniacally obsessed and brings to life a creature. Almost instantly, he is disgusted with his handiwork, repulsed by the ugliness of his creation. Just so, now that Dawkins has witnessed a decrease in Christian belief in the West and an increase in relativistic atheism, he finds himself horrified with the fruits of his labors. The single triumphant moment of achieving that goal has ended, and the scientist is now left staring into the blinking eyes of the monster he has made. Even though he railed against it, labelling Christian faith “one of the world’s great evils,” Dawkins has now found that the culture he enjoys and the moral code from which he has benefitted cannot exist without Christianity. The rapid, rampant Islamification of Europe is to Dawkins as the scarred face and yellow eyes of the creature were to Frankenstein. There is now no Christian League to defend Europe against the Muslims as there was at the Battle of Lepanto, there is no savage Vlad Țepeș to stop the equally-savage Muslims in their tracks, no Winged Hussars are coming to the rescue as at the Battle of Vienna. Dawkins and countless other little-minded secularists are now discovering that the Christian world which had once protected Europe and the West from the invasion of barbarians has, by their own hands, been suppressed, silenced, domesticated, and castrated. Too late, they realize that in pruning the branch they called Christianity, they have felled the entire tree. Perhaps if Dawkins had spent a little more time reading the works of serious Christian thinkers and a little less time mocking and belittling them, he might have realized that Christians had predicted the very world he now so fears. Nearly a century ago, the author and apologist C.S. Lewis wrote in his book The Abolition of Man about a world where the ideals of Dawkins would reign supreme, where might would make right because there would be no objective Christian morality to appeal to. Dawkins’s own campaign for relativistic atheism has brought this world to life, as Frankenstein brought his monster to life. Without objective Christian morals — that is, without morals defined by God Himself — who will define morality? Lewis wrote of a class he called the “Conditioners,” who would shape the values of the masses based solely on their own whims. “All motives that claim any validity other than that of their felt emotional weight at a given moment have failed them,” he explained. “But what never claimed objectivity cannot be destroyed by subjectivism.… When all that says ‘it is good’ has been debunked, what says ‘I want’ remains.… The Conditioners, therefore, must come to be motivated simply by their own pleasure.” Perhaps Dawkins and his ilk had imagined they themselves might be the Conditioners. After all, like Frankenstein, they labored long to bring their monster to life, and did things, as Lewis put it, “hitherto regarded as disgusting and impious — such as digging up and mutilating the dead.” Perhaps Dawkins’s “horror” is simply the horror of an effete intellectual who feels that some brute (Islam) has cheated him out of the title for which he has been scheming. (READ MORE: American Catholics Back Trump Over Biden ) Or perhaps Dawkins’s horror really is the horror of Frankenstein, witnessing the terror that he has helped breathe into existence. Shelley’s scientist committed the end of his days to hunting down and slaying the monster he created. Let us hope that Dawkins has at least the same integrity and commitment as his intellectual forefather."
"1","George Orwell fought to save language. I was blessed with a ninth-grade English teacher who assigned us not 1984 but Orwell’s essays. He aimed to make us not only good stylists, as Orwell’s instructions and example teaches crispness and clarity, but also to make us morally strong in our words. Orwell homed in on how the tyrant acts to shut down all thought that challenges him. The most effective way to do that is to subvert language. Words are wrenched free from their significance and made to mean only what the tyrant allows them to mean: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.” Let us look together at one such word and how it is being used to grab language out of our mouths and with the aim of greenlighting the most monstrous of crimes. With access to German internal messages, Winston Churchill agonized over the developing horror the organized Nazi destruction of European Jewry. He could not tip his hand, so as not to clue the Germans that their unbreakable codes had been broken, so he held off public comment until there was enough information from other sources. There was barely controlled passion in his words when he spoke at last on the radio on the topic in 1941: Whole districts are being exterminated. Scores of thousands—literally scores of thousands—of executions in cold blood are being perpetrated by the German police troops. We are in the presence of a crime without a name. A Polish Jew, Raphael Lemkin, who had escaped the horror and had made it to still-neutral America, heard Churchill’s speech. He realized the importance of having a name for this nameless crime and he generated it from the Greek root genos, which can mean when applied to humans a large identifiable grouping of humans, like a tribe or race, and the Latin cide , meaning killing, as in homicide or pesticide . The new word: genocide. (READ MORE from Shmuel Klatzkin: Right Brain, Left Brain, and the Kabbala: Knowing How We Know Matters ) The word “genocide” was created to allow us to speak directly about the crime that the Holocaust instantiated. Lemkin himself applied it as well to the Turkish organized mass murder of their Armenian minority during World War I. He campaigned for an international convention to forbid things that shared the characteristics of these two massive, sustained atrocities whose goal was to extinguish an entire people. Both the Nazis and the Turks had plenty of people who did not care about words at all and brought their own improvised cruelties to bear on the genocidal projects in which their governments employed them. But their regimes were both demolished, and the Nazi name became forever befouled throughout a world that had been so deeply scarred by its crimes. So those who follow its ideology, in particular its all-pervading hatred of Jews as demonic forces that must be exterminated, must escape the infamy that clings still to that Nazi project that they themselves carry on. That has been achieved by them in a satanically brilliant way: they have successfully launched the lie, constantly inflated, endlessly repeated, accompanied by the endless drumbeats and puerile rhythmic rhyming of those who wish not only to no longer think but stop you from thinking — the lie that it is Israel who is committing genocide. The least reflection exposes the lie as the worthless untruth that it is. Israel is waging war to defeat those whose express goal was to murder the souls and the bodies of every Jew they could, sent in motion by a working government and executed by an actual organized army, accomplished by sadistic civilian thrill-seeker camp-followers who enjoyed a few days of rape, torture, and kidnapping. Hamas has announced that it intends to continue to act like this whenever it can. Its ends are expressly genocidal, and its actions are exactly consonant with those aims. Its culture, schooled into the children under their rule by UN confederates, trains them from birth to orient the moral structure of their life around the task of destroying Jewish life, both nationally and individually. This should be pretty easy to be recognized as a gross and criminal lie. And yet, it has captured the children raised with no understanding of what Americans gave their lives to overcome in World War II. Riding that horrifying cultural wave is a political movement that has made its bid to reshape American policy and the world, which not only swallows the lie but becomes its active advocate. (READ MORE: Antisemitism Goes Hand-in-Hand With Societal Decay ) Listen to the news, read and hear the language of Blinken, Biden, and their eager crew. They have not yet explicitly accused Israel of genocide in defending itself, but they are setting it up. It is hinted at clumsily and ponderously — we are ready to deploy that word on you if you do not allow us to rescue Hamas. But Hamas actually practices genocide. That’s what they will do given the chance. Had Israel’s goals ever been genocidal, had it acted with the complete focus on wiping out Gazans with the same devotion of available resources, there would be no one left. Israel’s goals are as ours were in World War II, what the Jews were powerless to achieve in World War II — to defend successfully against genocide and to eliminate the genocidal perpetrators and their culture. But now, in Biden’s America, war is peace. Those who shattered the ceasefire of October 6 are to be spared, rewarded, elevated. Those who fight against are to be demonized. And a sign of the times in Biden’s America, an X post from user Malcolm Harris (@BigMeanInternet) that has since been deleted (thanks to the redoubtable Nellie Bowles for reposting it): Wild that Israel’s genocide has literally reversed the meaning of a swastika on a synagogue, from a Nazi threat to a condemnation of genocide. So has it really come, as at the end of Animal Farm , that the fighters for freedom are indistinguishable from the oppressors? Harris is proud and ready, it seems, to pick up the swastika and its agenda, cleansed by a little bit of Decontructionist magic, and join the exhilaration attending the freefall dive into the Nietzschean abyss. He’s got a lot of company out there, and in many places of power. They are likewise enjoying the ride, so far. The abyss is grinning right back, opening its maw wide to swallow them whole. Hitler is waiting to welcome his own."
"1","One of the most effective methods of manipulation is the age-old technique known as bait and switch. It’s kind of a setup. You offer something that you think the other party might want and after they accept it you then alter it in such a way as to make it undesirable and bingo you’ve put them in a false position. This is what the Biden administration has recently done in offering to build a temporary pier in Gaza. In 2005 after Israel had completely evacuated all of its citizens from Gaza it offered to build a small port for the newly born Palestinian statelet. However, the Palestinians rejected the port. But why? For a state that lies on the sea a port would appear to be a rather desirable piece of infrastructure. Sea transportation is cheaper than any other and supplies in cargo ships could be offloaded there easily and cheaply. Passengers could embark and disembark to stay at the seaside resorts that could have been built along the Mediterranean shore. Why reject a port? (READ MORE from Max Dublin: The Blinken Follies ) The answer would appear to be that for a number of reasons a port was not the right kind of infrastructure that terrorists were looking for at that time because ports are in the open and exposed to surveillance and inspection in the way that tunnels are not. It must be remembered that the elaborate tunnel system that Hamas has for decades been using to wage its terror war against Israel was started by terrorist groups in Gaza even before Hamas came to power in the Strip. Of course, after gaining control of Gaza, Hamas, as we have learned during the present War, elaborated the tunnel system well beyond even the best estimates of Israeli Intelligence. And it has served its terrorist purposes very well, not only for launching attacks against Israel but more generally for clandestine movement and control. Moreover, there was another piece to this set-up which Israel has discovered during the present war and it has to do with Egypt. Although Egypt and Israel have made peace with one another it is what has often been called a “cold peace.” During all these years Egypt has never really deradicalized its population. Perhaps the main reason for this is that Egypt is a failed nation. Vast swathes of the Egyptian population continue to live in extreme poverty and are restive. The popular press in Egypt continues to demonize Israel and for the most part the Egypt street remains hostile to the Jewish state. The upshot of this is that during this cold peace there has been a huge amount of smuggling of arms and other supplies from Egypt into Gaza but it has not been done through the Rafah Gate. Last month Ron Jager reported in the Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom, Military analysts have estimated that in the Rafah border town alone there are hundreds of tunnels, some wide enough to allow transport vehicles to pass through from Egyptian territory into the Gaza Strip, supposedly clandestinely. Egypt was silently complicit and contributed to Hamas’ military build-up, aiding Hamas in becoming a strategic threat to the State of Israel. In other words, Egypt, much as other Moslem nations in the region, has been playing both ends against the middle. This brings us to Biden’s pier idea. Initially the pier was to be built by the U.S. Army and it was supposed to take two months to construct. At first, the Netanyahu government looked favorably upon the idea because it has always been in favor of facilitating humanitarian aid to ordinary Palestinians without interception by Hamas. But then it was announced that Qatar would build and operate the pier, which is an entirely different matter. Qatar has long been one of Hamas’ major paymasters, it hosts Hamas top political leaders and also, through the broadcaster Al Jazeera, is its most important propaganda wing in the Arabic speaking world. If the Pentagon were building the pier, one might expect that there would be effective cooperation between the U.S. and the IDF. But whatever its stated intentions it is inescapable that Qatar will use the pier, one way or another, to support Hamas. As a matter of fact, as soon as America gave Qatar the job of building and operating the pier it immediately exploited this opportunity to use the pier as a Trojan Horse to support Hamas. According to Baruch Yadid, Israel’s Channel 14 Arab Affairs correspondent, The Qataris didn’t only say yes, the Qataris came with an additional demand. The Qataris wanted this port to be built by a company named Al-Hissi from Gaza. This company is the primary supplier for engineering, electricity and infrastructure for Hamas … It is controlled by, and is a subsidiary of, Hamas. As the Biden administration increasingly tries to impose its will on its only democratic ally in the Middle East its favorite game is bait and switch. While Israel is following its wartime objective of destroying Hamas both militarily and politically in Gaza, Biden keeps trying to sneak them back in, first by advocating that the PLO take over control of Gaza at the very moment that they were negotiating unity with Hamas . Now the same with the Gaza pier. It must be remembered that Qatar, like Iran, is a major state sponsor of terrorism not only through its support of Hamas but also Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah and the Al Nusra Front. If it wanted to the United States could put an end to Qatar’s support of Hamas in a heartbeat without firing a shot. All America would have to do would be to threaten to remove its Al-Udeid Air Base, the headquarters of CENTCOM, from Qatar. But the U.S. has recently offered to extend the contract for keeping the base there for ten years while at the same time giving Qatar cover by engaging it as a “mediator” in the Israel-Hamas war. At this point Israel has no choice about what it must do. Already, to counter this subterfuge Netanyahu has announced that Israel will enforce a “security bubble” around the pier. Next, with or without U.S. support, Israel must execute an operation in Rafah to finish off Hamas and rescue the remaining living hostages. It must then destroy the tunnels running from Egypt to the enclave. At that point it will have security control of the Strip and reconstruction can commence. (READ MORE: In Their Words: The Families of Hamas’ Victims ) If the power brokers of the world really care about innocent Gazan civilians, they will then cooperate with Israel to ensure that neither Hamas nor a PLO-Hamas partnership never again rules the enclave. The pier or mini-port was always a good idea for Gaza if used for peaceful purposes and if built would be very useful for facilitating reconstruction and humanitarian assistance. In the meantime, the Israeli naval blockade is still in force and Israel has been cooperating with its ally Cyprus to bring humanitarian aid by sea to Gaza to be distributed by the World Food Program."
"1","Editor’s note: Jonas Greindberg, a German-based journalist who covers conservative parties in Europe, conducted an interview with Mr. Dries Van Langenhove last week after Langenhove was sentenced to one year in jail for memes found in his possession. Mr. Langenhove is a former member of the Belgian parliament, founder of the Flemish Identitarian movement “Schild & Vrienden,” and an influential political dissident in Belgium. Jonas Greindberg: On the 13th of March, a Belgian court sentenced you to one year in prison and gave you a hefty fine. What did you do? Dries Van Langenhove: An undercover journalist discovered allegedly politically incorrect memes in a private group chat. They were then broadcast on public television in Belgium. A huge police investigation followed which took many years, they raided my house three times. They stole my computer, my smartphone, every electronic device, every piece of paper they took away. And after four or five years of investigation, the only thing that they allegedly found was memes and a picture of a flask of pepper spray. That’s all that they found. And they are now using that to send me to jail. The most influential and the biggest political dissident, political opposition figure in Belgium is being sent to jail for memes in a private group chat. Memes, just to be clear, that I myself didn’t even post and most of the time didn’t even see. Our Belgian media and politicians are constantly blabbering about people like Navalny in Russia, but what is happening here in Belgium is the Western equivalent to what is happening in some other states around the world when it comes to the shutting down of political opposition. I myself didn’t do anything wrong, I have just served my nation, I have done my duty as I said to make sure that the lands of our ancestors remain the lands of our descendants. Greindberg: Part of the verdict is that you lose your political rights. So how are we able to this discussion on politics at this moment? Langenhove: Because I appealed the court sentence. So now I have about, I think, six or seven months at maximum to keep doing what I do, to speak the truth, hopefully in an uncensored way. I’ve been pleading to Elon Musk to allow me to freely speak on X to present my case to the world, to let the world know what is happening in Western Europe when you are a political dissident. And after that, I will either be cleared of any wrongdoing or I will be sentenced to a jail sentence and possibly be shut down forever in Belgium. The punishment is one year in jail, an effective jail sentence. It’s a 16,000 euro fine and 10,000 euros in damages, then about an extra 10,000 euros in court fees. And then I also lose my political rights for 10 years, which is the harshest sentence that they could legally give me. And it means that I cannot participate in politics for 10 years, which shows ever more clearly that this is a political case. Greindberg: In June, Belgium will elect a new federal parliament. Is this the opportunity to turn Belgium around? Langenhove: I hope so. I think there is a realistic opportunity, a realistic chance of “Vlaams Belang,” a real nationalist party, getting into power. They are right now getting a third of the votes, which is huge. And we also have a moderate nationalist party that gets about 15 to 20 percent of the votes. So together they could form a nationalist government which could light the fire of nationalism all throughout Europe, I hope, because that would turn the center of Europe, Brussels and Flanders, into a nationalist stronghold that really is our dream, our goal, and something I strive towards with all the projects that I am leading with my media channel, my videos. It sounds cliche, but the coming elections may be the most important elections in the history of our country. Greindberg: On the same day the Belgian parliament is elected, there will be the elections for the European parliament. For the first time in the history of the EU, citizens at the age of 16 can cast their vote. How will the Flemish youth vote? Langenhove: In the past elections in 2019 where I got elected as the youngest member of the Belgian parliament showed that I was the most popular political figure with the Flemish youth. Even though the demographic clock is ticking and many of our youth have foreign backgrounds, “Vlaams Belang” is still by far the most popular political party with the Flemish youth, especially with Flemish young men. With young women more leftwing parties are slightly more popular. That is so across the whole world, across the whole West. Every investigation into voter behavior shows that women tend to lean more to the left, men tend to lean more to the right. Dries Van Langenhove outside his offices in Belgium. Greindberg: Should Belgium stay in the EU? Langenhove: When I speak to people like Victor Orbán , he believes that we can change the European Union from the inside out. I have a slightly more pessimistic point of view. I think supranational and global institutions will end up eventually being leftwing, universalist, egalitarian, simply because these institutions attract people that have this mindset. If you’re at university, for example, you’re a right-wing student, you mostly study economics, business, you study to become a doctor or a lawyer or a businessman, an engineer. But if you’re leftist, you’re more going to study human sciences, political science, international or European studies, stuff like that. And these people end up more in these international institutions. The real power, unfortunately, doesn’t really lie with the European Parliament . I believe that even if the European Parliament would one day end up having a majority of nationalist or conservative or right-wing leaning MEPs, I still think that the bureaucracy, the Eurocracy as we call it in Flanders, will consist of so many leftist thinkers that it will be very hard to really implement right-wing politics in the European Union. Which is not to say that elections don’t matter, we have an obligation to make sure that as many right-wing MEPs get elected as possible. But I think that the real change will come from nation states, from people like Viktor Orbán. He stands alone sometimes in European negotiations, but he does really make a difference. Imagine if there would be five or six Viktor Orbán’s in the European Union, or someday, perhaps even a majority of the European leaders consisting of people such as Viktor Orbán. That would really create the biggest difference, I think.

"1","I was born and raised in New York City and lived there until my early forties. I loved the city of my birth, although from time to time, like many others (even in those last days of the twentieth century, when Rudy Giuliani had restored it to greatness), I thought frequently about moving someplace else — specifically, in my case, someplace warmer. My happiest times as a boy had been during summer vacations in my mother’s small South Carolina hometown and on the glorious Grand Strand; but in the pre-Internet era, being a cultural journalist in North Myrtle Beach was a non-starter. L.A. was a possibility, and once I actually rented an apartment in West Hollywood, only to break the lease two days later and run back to New York. Then there was Cannes: when, in 1990, the American Spectator shipped me there to cover the film festival, I instantly fell in love with the place, and for years thereafter I entertained images of myself walking up one of its hilly, cobbled streets with a baguette under my arm. But, no, I stayed in New York — right up until the late 1990s, when certain life events led me to spend six months in Amsterdam, after which, having fallen hopelessly in love, I abandoned all thoughts of warmer climes and followed my new significant other to Norway, where I’ve lived ever since. Relocating to Europe was a big change. But one thing stayed the same. I remained a writer — and, more to the point, a critic. Living in New York, I’d repeatedly sounded off about aspects of American society, culture, and politics that I found wanting. After moving to Europe, I began to pay more attention to European affairs, notably in my 2006 book While Europe Slept. If I’ve written about Norway with unusual frequency and, perhaps, unusual fierceness, it’s precisely because I’ve felt obliged to cast an especially harsh eye on what’s going on in my own backyard. At the same time, I’ve continued to write about America (as in my 2012 book, The Victims’ Revolution, about identity studies in U.S. universities). My expatriate status, far from making this more of a challenge, has given me a curious combination of an insider’s and an outsider’s perspective that, I think, has enhanced my ability to comment usefully on my native country. (I suspect that many earlier self- exiles — among them Henry James, T.S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein, Paul Bowles, James Baldwin, and Patricia Highsmith — would understand what I’m talking about here.) (READ MORE from Bruce Bawer: Feud’s New Miniseries Recycles Old Truman Capote Gossip ) I’ve now lived in Norway for twenty-five years. During most of that time, it wasn’t possible for me to become a Norwegian citizen without forswearing my U.S. citizenship. Curiously, while the U.S. has allowed dual citizenship since 1967, Norway, until recently, permitted it only in very unusual circumstances. From one angle, to be sure, the thought of exchanging an American for a Norwegian passport was tempting: the U.S. is one of only three countries (along with Eritrea and Myanmar) that tax citizens living abroad. But as someone whose ancestors on my mother’s side fought in the Revolution and Civil War (in both the Union and Confederate armies), and whose paternal grandparents thanked God every day for having found refuge in America from the strife, poverty, and bigotry of eastern Europe, I wasn’t about to forsake my American identity, no matter how much mishigas I had to endure at the hands of the IRS. Besides, during the first decade or so of my residence in Norway — a time when I lived in Oslo and saw that city rapidly being Islamized — I viewed my U.S. passport as a lifeline, a guarantee that there was a place to which, when the time came, my partner and I could flee. As it happens, Norway’s ban on dual citizenship was rare in Western Europe: for decades, Turks who were granted German citizenship, for example, were permitted to remain Turkish citizens as well. A few years ago, inevitably, it was proposed that Norway go with the flow. Debate ensued. In a 2018 op-ed , the leader of the Center Party opposed the idea, maintaining that citizenship involves the kinds of rights and responsibilities that leave no room for multiple loyalties or commitments. Victor Davis Hanson, who made the same argument in his 2021 book The Dying Citizen, contended in a 2022 essay for the New Criterion that “an erosion of citizenship” is the root cause of innumerable social ills, from high levels of crime to increasing tribalism to decaying infrastructure. I’ve written about these matters myself. In a 2019 essay for Commentary, “The ‘Global Citizen’ Fraud,” I noted with displeasure that during the previous decade, the concept of citizenship had become “not only passé but déclassé.” Many bien pensant types now styled themselves “global citizens” — a concept introduced by Diogenes in the fourth century B.C. But in his day Diogenes was an outlier. In ancient Greece, I wrote, citizenship “was inextricable from the idea of civilization”; later, in Rome, citizenship “conferred protection and prestige throughout the ancient world…. It meant, at a bare minimum, a degree of respect and rights and security that was without parallel.” Today, however, we live in the shadow of John Lennon’s “Imagine”: “Imagine there’s no countries.” As if a borderless world would solve everything. Poppycock. “Global citizens,” I charged, pretend to possess, or sincerely think they possess, a loyalty that transcends borders. It sounds pretty. But it’s not. By the same token, to some ears a straightforward declaration of patriotism can sound exclusionary, bigoted, racist. It isn’t. To assert a national identity is to make a moral statement and to take on a responsibility. To call yourself a global citizen is to do the equivalent of wearing a peace button — you’re making a meaningless statement because you think it makes you look virtuous. To be sure, there’s a vast difference between global citizenship and dual — or even multiple — citizenship. When I lived in Amsterdam, I had a friend, Paul, who’d grown up in Canada and Florida with a British mother and American father. When he moved to the Netherlands as an adult he already had three passports — British, American, and Canadian — and soon acquired a fourth. I never thought of Paul as being potentially torn between seriously conflicting loyalties. By contrast, being a dual citizen of a Western democracy and of a Muslim sultanate or emirate with a sharia-based law system is an obvious recipe for conflict. It’s this kind of dual citizenship that has boomed in recent decades. Last year, Hugh Fitzgerald wrote at FrontPage that in 2022 alone “about 70,000 Muslims, from just three countries,” had been granted German citizenship. “How,” asked Fitzgerald, “can a Muslim believer offer a sincere ‘civic commitment’ to the German state, created by and for Infidels, whom he has been taught are ‘the most vile of created beings’ (Qur’an 98:6)?” How indeed? Also last year, Fitzgerald pointed out that 90 percent of the participants in a recent series of destructive riots in France had been identified as “French citizens” — but that 90 percent of those citizens were actually Muslims who, while “milk[ing] the French welfare state of every conceivable benefit,” refused “to integrate into French society” because they “still saw the world through the lens of Islam,” which meant that they viewed French natives as “the most vile of created beings.” In America, the foreign country that has most often, in modern times, been at the center of charges of divided loyalties is, of course, Israel. In the March 1950 issue of Commentary, the columnist Dorothy Thompson fretted at length that American Jews’ attachment to the newly founded Jewish state would diminish their devotion to America. “The American of Jewish religion,” she wrote, has always been, and as long as this nation holds to its basic and Constitutional principles will always be, accepted as a full and equal citizen. But sooner or later the Jewish nationalist, which today means the Israeli nationalist, will have to choose allegiances. ‘One cannot,’ says an old Jewish proverb, ‘sit on one chair at two weddings.’ There is no room in American nationality for two citizenships or two nationalities. In the same issue of Commentary , however, the historian Oscar Handlin replied to Thompson’s arguments by noting that ties of blood to other countries have always informed Americans’ views on foreign relations. “When the Scottish-born Andrew Carnegie or the English-born E. L. Godkin argued for closer American ties with the land of their birth,” wrote Handlin, “there was no suspicion that they were treacherously dividing their loyalties or deviating in the slightest degree from their attachment to the land of their adoption.” Hence, requests by American Jews that their government take steps on their behalf as Jews are not at all unusual…. Now, as in the past, the Jews of this country maintain an interest and, through their government, act in behalf of those across the seas, in Israel and elsewhere, to whom they feel particular ties of brotherhood along with those that bind them to all men. Such actions and such motives are wholly creditable and wholly American. Indeed. I have American and European Jewish friends who have moved to Israel permanently or who at least spend a good deal of time there. The young American-born son of a dear American friend of mine is a member of the IDF. To me, his service, his sacrifice, and his courage are beautiful to behold, and make him, in my view, a more admirable American than he would otherwise be. Certainly his case could not be more different than that of some freeloader from Guatemala or Mauritania or China who, after entering the U.S. illegally, is given ample government benefits that are denied to legal immigrants — and, for that matter, to natural-born Americans, including military veterans — and placed on a fast track to legal residency and, ultimately, a U.S. passport. (READ MORE: No, the 1950s Weren’t ‘Dull’ and ‘Conformist.’ Neither Were the Movies. ) Some arguments against dual citizenship are motivated, quite understandably, by a concern about freeloaders. In one 2018 op-ed , Andreas Christiansen Halse, a former head of the Norwegian Socialist Party’s youth division, made the following case. Among Muslim immigrants who’ve exchanged their original citizenship for Norwegian citizenship, he observed, it’s standard practice to fly one’s teenage daughters back to the old country (where they’re never turned away), force her into an arranged marriage, and hold her prisoner there until she gives birth — whereupon the daughter, husband, and baby are brought back to Norway so that the latter two can enjoy Norwegian welfare benefits, and, ultimately, acquire their own Norwegian passports. On rare occasions, the fact that the bride in question is a Norwegian citizen — and not a citizen of any other country — makes it possible for the Norwegian government to intervene on her behalf; if the Norwegian government allowed such families to retain their original passports, however, it would render itself powerless to act in such cases. Halse has a good argument here — but it’s an argument against awarding Norwegian citizenship in the first place to devout Muslims who seem likely to force marriages on their children and to hold them prisoner in their native lands. One remarkable case , which came to light in 2017, focused attention on the issue of granting Norwegian citizenship to people who come from countries with very different values and who plainly still retain those values: it turned out that the just–elected prime minister of Somalia, Hassan Ali Khaire, was a dual citizen, holding passports from both Somalia and, yes, Norway. Which brings to mind Ilhan Omar, who recently delivered a speech in which she made it clear that her primary loyalty isn’t to America but to her native Somalia. Her remarks served as yet another reminder that many a Western country is granting citizenship these days to people who know and care nothing about its history, culture, and values. Obviously the U.S. erred when it granted citizenship to Omar, because her fierce loyalty to majority-Muslim Somalia — the fifth least democratic country in Africa — is entirely incongruent with loyalty to the U.S. By contrast, my affection for Norway — a founding member of NATO that, like the U.S., is basically a democracy (despite the popularity here of the very same woke ideologies that currently plague the U.S.) — doesn’t seem to me to be dramatically at odds with my attachment to the land of my birth. And whereas my U.S. passport used to feel to me like a lifeline, I’ve felt increasingly that having a Norwegian passport would be very useful to me if the Democrats retained power in the 2024 elections and beyond and continued to steer the U.S. in the direction it’s going. Which brings me to January 1, 2020. On that day, after considerable debate, dual citizenship became legal in Norway. Ultimately, the measure had won support across the political spectrum; among its strongest advocates in parliament was the Progress Party’s Sylvi Listhaug, an outspoken critic of mass Muslim immigration, whose chief reason for supporting dual citizenship was that it would make it easier to withdraw Norwegian citizenship from terrorists and other Muslim miscreants and deport them to their original homelands. After the law came into effect, I wrestled with the question of whether to apply to be a Norwegian citizen. On the one hand, there was the issue of divided loyalty. On the other hand, there were the sights that greeted me every time I set foot in Oslo airport. Inevitably, my blue U.S. passport in my hand, I’d pass Muslim families — the mothers in hijab or even niqab — carrying red Norwegian passports. They invariably had tons of luggage, because they were flying to their native land, where they planned to stay for several months. For that land was their real home; to them, Norway was an ATM, a source of free welfare income. Researchers have shown that not a few people with Norwegian citizenship have actually bought palaces in their native Pakistan with the money they’ve collected from the Norwegian government. Some of them even own slaves. (Yes, you read that right: they own slaves. ) If these leeches deserved Norwegian passports, I found myself wondering, why didn’t I? Hell, forget about the Muslims. A few years ago I took a test online that showed my Norwegian vocabulary to be better than that of well over 99 percent of natives. Didn’t that count for something? Then there was this simple point: during the pandemic, when the U.S. government sent out checks to absolutely everybody, I opposed it vehemently. How better to spike inflation and damage the world economy? But when my check arrived, I cashed it. I’d have been an idiot not to. In the same way, if dual citizenship was on offer, and every rogue, rascal, and reprobate without the remotest sense of national loyalty to any country was eligible, how could I not take what I had coming to me? But it wasn’t just a matter of what I deserved. I’ve lived in Norway for a quarter century. I’ve criticized the hell out of it. The more I mulled over the subject, the more I felt an obligation to take out Norwegian citizenship. Applying for a Norwegian passport would be a token of my respect for, and sense of responsibility toward, the country in which I live and where — I’m 67 now — I expect I’ll spend the rest of my life. Once, a long time ago, I wrote a piece somewhere that was critical of some aspect of Norway — I don’t remember the specifics — and one of Norway’s major newspapers replied with a full-page article headlined, “The man who hates Norway.” Taking out Norwegian citizenship would indicate, once and for all, that whenever I criticize this country (and I’m criticizing it a great deal these days for, among other things, its government’s intense hostility to Israel and affection for Hamas), it’s because I have a vested interest in its well-being and want to contribute, as best I can, to its improvement. So I finally decided to apply for citizenship. This past February 6, I went to the police station in the city of Drammen and submitted my paperwork to a friendly young policewoman. The meeting went quickly. I was told that the average wait time for a decision was two years. So imagine my surprise when, three weeks later, on February 28, I received an email telling me that I was now a Norwegian citizen. Simple as that. How different from America! When you become a U.S. citizen, you get dressed up and attend a moving ceremony at which, along with other brand-new citizens, you pledge allegiance to the flag and swear an oath in which you state that you hereby “absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen” (a rather odd vow, given that the U.S., as noted, has permitted dual citizenship, and therefore joint national allegiances, for over half a century). You also get a certificate suitable for framing. (READ MORE: The Whole Ugly Hustle of Globalism: Itxu Díaz’s I Will Not Eat Crickets ) But in Norway, there’s no ceremony, no oath, no certificate. You receive the email and that’s it. If you want a Norwegian passport, you wait at least a week after getting the news about your citizenship, then go to your local police station and have your picture taken. (I did that on March 5.) It’s not that Norway doesn’t take citizenship seriously; it’s just that Scandinavians are more prosaic, more matter-of-fact, about such matters, than Americans. But I have to admit that I wasn’t. When I read the email telling me that I was now a Norwegian citizen, I was surprised by the intensity of my reaction: I bawled like one of those little boys in YouTube videos who’ve just been given a new puppy. And no, I don’t think my honest acknowledgment of my sense of belonging to Norway, in some way and to some degree, detracts in any way from my undying loyalty to the country of my birth. Truth to tell, I tear up at both “The Star-spangled Banner” and the Norwegian national anthem, “Ja, vi elsker.” So sue me."
"2","Of all the pop stars currently working in America, Beyoncé is undoubtedly the most visually sophisticated. Every new album comes with a lush, rigorously staged set of images, dense with allusions and Easter eggs, that act as an elaboration and a commentary on the themes of the album. In the Lemonade era around 2016, Beyoncé made herself into a goddess of many identities: the Christian Virgin Mary, the Roman Venus , the Yoruba Oshun . With 2022’s Renaissance , she became a disco diva celebrating the pleasures of the dance floor as a safe space for queer Black joy. Now, in Cowboy Carter , the country-inflected album she dropped at the end of March, Beyoncé has reinvented herself in perhaps the most difficult transformation of all. She’s transformed herself from American goddess into goddess of America. Let’s decode the imagery of Cowboy Carter together. Sweetheart of the rodeo The album cover for Cowboy Carter sees Beyoncé sitting sidesaddle on a white horse, in red, white, and blue leathers. In one hand she’s holding the horse’s reins, and in the other, the American flag. Together, her upraised arms and her head and neck create a sort of W shape. “It’s such an awkward and specific gesture,” says Sonya Abrego, a design historian specializing in the history of American fashion. “I really don’t think Beyoncé and her team did that accidentally.” Abrego sees Beyoncé’s pose as echoing the posture of a woman in an illustrated map called “ Evolution of the Cowboy ,” created by artist Jo Mora in 1933. The full illustration charts the way cowboy gear and techniques changed over time, along with a rundown of the different cowboy archetypes of various territories. In the center top of the chart, though, we see a woman in a cowboy hat and riding leathers, standing with her arms upraised so that, together with her head and neck, they create a W shape. Behind her, a legend reads “sweetheart of the rodeo.” Flowers blossom in the air where she gestures; she is the bountiful source of the rodeo and all that it signifies. Mara’s sweetheart of the rodeo became the cover of a Byrds album. Columbia via Wikimedia Commons The sweetheart of the rodeo has appeared on album covers. The Byrds used her on the cover of their 1968 album, tellingly titled Sweetheart of the Rodeo . It was known as one of the first country-rock albums, a crossover country album from a band that, like Beyoncé, built their name on a different genre. The horse of a different color The horse Beyoncé is riding on the cover of Cowboy Carter looks white, but it’s not just any white horse. It’s a Lipizzaner , a breed that is usually born with a brown or black coat that grows in gray and then white over time. This transition is common among gray horses , but it’s a telling choice here — especially given the themes of the album, with its name-check to Linda Martell, the first solo Black woman country artist to play the Grand Ole Opry . The title Cowboy Carter , too, nods to the whitewashed work of Black artists in the history of country music. The Carter Family was one of country’s weightiest acts, and they developed their distinctive sound under the influence of Black musician Lesley Riddle . Riddle taught them his innovative style of guitar picking, and he got the Carters entrance to Black spaces, like churches, to help them gather songs from Black communities that went on to help form the basis of the white country songbook. Cowboy Carter is a history lesson on the Black musicians who helped build country music and whose contributions were swiftly whitewashed. It’s fitting, then, that Beyoncé ride a horse that was black at its birth but is now considered white. The All-American girl On the album’s vinyl cover, Beyoncé channels Lady Liberty. Beyoncé/Blair Cardwell via Instagram On the official album cover, Beyoncé’s wearing the colors of the American flag on her body and holding the American flag. On the vinyl cover, she’s standing in a Statue of Liberty pose with a Miss America sash around her torso and her hair in red, white, and blue beads. She’s playing with one of the common visual motifs of country music, which is Americana kitsch. In country and Western music, the West acts as a synecdoche for America itself: Western iconography is American iconography because the West is America. “If you go around the world and ask people for a symbol of the United States, it’s the cowboy that people say,” says Josh Garrett-Davis, H. Russell Smith Foundation curator of Western American history at the Huntington. The cowboy becoming a symbol of America is not an accident, Garrett-Davis points out. In 1893, historian Frederick Jackson Turner posited the frontier thesis , claiming that the distinctive American character was rough and independent and that it came from the nation’s constant movement westward. Theodore Roosevelt, a wealthy East Coaster who needed to add some grit to his image, picked up on the ideas and began to make much of his time in North Dakota. “All these indicated that just a touch of sort of wildness on the Western frontier could kind of give America its character and refresh,” says Garrett-Davis. “It’s in a sense masculinizing because they were worried that, in the Industrial Age, the country was becoming too feminized.” The heroic myth of the cowboy was also a deeply white supremacist idea. “They erase the fact that a good portion of the working cowboys in the American West were Indigenous, Mexican, and African American,” says Garrett-Davis. “This was a fiction that was created using these icons of the cowboy, but not really the truth of what cowboy life was like. Cowboys were migrant agricultural laborers in terrible conditions being underpaid.” By placing her Black female body in the poses and costumes of Western Americana, Beyoncé disrupts that mythology. She evokes the lineage of the erased people of color who came before her — in the West, in country as a genre — and she insists on her right to be there now. Whatever else happens, Beyoncé is always a goddess Let’s go back to the vinyl cover, with Beyoncé standing in the pose of the Statue of Liberty, replacing the statue’s torch with a boss-man cigar and the statue’s crown with beaded braids. It’s worth remembering that the statue is also a goddess — she’s the Roman goddess Libertas , or Liberty. Beyoncé is pulling from the Lemonade playbook here to evoke a classical goddess while keeping the details specifically Beyoncé. She’s also added a touch of masculine swagger with that cigar, reminding us all that before she was a goddess, Beyoncé crowned herself King B . On the pageant queen sash around her torso, Beyoncé’s name appears to be misspelled: Beyincé. The apparent error references a painful family episode. Beyoncé’s name comes from her mother, Tina Knowles, born Celestine Beyoncé. On her birth certificate, though, Tina’s last name was misspelled as “Beyincé.” On a recent podcast , Tina says she asked her mother why she didn’t get the birth certificate corrected. “And she said, ‘I did one time. The first time, and I was told, ‘Be happy that you’re getting a birth certificate,’ because, at one time, Black people didn’t get birth certificates,” she added. In the same image where she re-establishes herself as a goddess, Beyoncé references a moment where the very infrastructure of America seemed designed to inflict humiliation on her family because of their Blackness. The play between those two ideas is part of the play of this whole album: placing Black people back in the center of a genre and aesthetic that erased them, and making the moment beautiful.

"2","Have you ever been invited by a friend or a family member to a coffee shop or a lunch date, and when you get there you realize that they don’t just want to catch up? Instead, it turns out they’ve got a great business opportunity for you. All you have to do is spend a little money on the front end, maybe buy a package of protein supplements or meal replacement smoothies, and pretty soon you’ll be your own boss and living the dream. If that sounds familiar, it’s because this is an enormously popular business model, called multilevel marketing (MLM), in which sellers make money either by selling products or recruiting others to sell those products. Millions of people in America participate in MLMs, and while the people at the top make billions and wield a lot of power, roughly 99 percent of the people who join up don’t make — and often lose — money. For that reason, MLMs have — rightly — been controversial and a target of regulators. Critics see them as little more than legal pyramid schemes. One of those critics is Jane Marie, the host of a podcast series called The Dream and the author of a new book, Selling the Dream , both of which investigate the intersection of MLMs and pyramid schemes and the broader “wellness” industry. I wanted to know a little more about the history of these businesses and why they persist despite their track record, so I invited Marie on The Gray Area to talk about it. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. As always, there’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Stitcher , or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday. Sean Illing What’s the simplest definition of multilevel marketing? Jane Marie Basically, if you picture a triangle, there’s people that own it at the very top. Then they recruit, say, five people, and the way the scheme goes is those five people are supposed to recruit five more, and then those five are supposed to recruit five more, and the idea is that it keeps expanding exponentially. And the way multilevel marketing companies differentiate themselves from straight-up pyramid schemes is that there’s some sort of product or service involved. It gets sold to people being recruited into it. Almost all of them have a sign-up fee. They usually have a kit or a collection of products that you have to purchase right away when you join. And that money is what flows up the pyramid. The people at the very bottom often quit pretty quickly because they’re not making any money, and then they’re replaced by more eager, hopeful folks who buy what the company is selling, which is false hope. Sean Illing Is there actually a meaningful distinction between a pyramid scheme and an MLM? Jane Marie I don’t think so, but the legal difference, which is debatable, is that there’s a valid product or service involved in an MLM. But when you dig a little deeper, the products are typically overpriced. They’re not something unique. They’re things you can find in the regular marketplace for a lot cheaper, or the service is offering something that’s cheaper and works better. Sean Illing Do we have any idea how many active MLMs there are now and how many billions the industry brings in every year? Jane Marie One in 13 adults in America have participated in an MLM, which is a lot. And they’ve expanded into developing countries. So there’s a huge MLM presence now in Southeast Asia and in Mexico and South America. It’s just a guess, but I’d say the industry is probably worth $40 billion or $50 billion. Sean Illing MLMs disproportionately target women and they seem to thrive in rural areas and on military bases where spouses are often alone with the kids. In many ways, that’s not all that surprising, but how do you explain it? Jane Marie Well, they’re feeding on the idea that we’re all raised on in America, which is that if you work hard, try hard, you’ll get rewarded. The world is your oyster — that whole thing. But it just isn’t true. The promise is still very attractive, though. The appeal of the American dream, it doesn’t ever really go away. And the architects of these schemes understand that that’s all you really need to appeal to. This is what they sell. Do you remember how when you were growing up, you were told that you should be able to achieve anything you want? We’re going to be the only company that gives you that opportunity. And even better, they don’t ask if you have a high school diploma. They don’t care if you’re a felon. You can do anything and be anything. And they’re specifically going after groups that need that opportunity or that feel they need that opportunity and aren’t given that opportunity by the mainstream marketplace. Sean Illing The thing that really drove me to your book is how you draw a straight line between what we think of as the “wellness industry,” which includes the vapid world of online “life coaches,” and MLMs. Can you tell me about the connections here? Why is the story of MLMs also the story about the rise of wellness hucksters and life coaches? Jane Marie It’s kind of an endless chicken and egg thing, but I’ll tell you the elements that I see. One thing is that MLMs, wellness, and life coaching all preach this idea that they — the big “they” — don’t want you to know that there is in fact a cheat code to life. They don’t want you to know that you don’t have to go to therapy. You just need a life coach. They don’t want you to know that you don’t have to do chemotherapy, you just need to buy this vitamin or this oil. They don’t want you to know that you don’t have to go to college, you can just sell Tupperware. So it’s the same mindset with all this. There’s an “us versus them” mentality and it feeds on the idea that there’s a shortcut and a cheat code to financial prosperity, to achieving the American Dream. Sean Illing I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of time on Instagram surveying the whole life coaching space and the amount of bullshit on offer is just incredible. I realize not all life coaching is like this, but there’s a guy I used to know a long time ago and I discovered recently that this is what he does. And he’s not just a “life coach,” he’s the coach of aspiring life coaches. He was always charismatic and now he’s shifted into some kind of New Age douchebag Socrates, and it appears to be working very well for him. But it looks like a straight-up pyramid scheme to me, a lot like the classic MLMs, because it relies on this fantasy that there’s an infinite supply of clients out there for these potential life coaches. And maybe there is, in theory at least, but the reality is that almost every one of these people are going to spend thousands of dollars taking this stupid guy’s stupid course and they’re not going to make any of it back! Jane Marie Unless they develop their own course, which is also what he’s teaching them. He’s showing them the way to make money selling the course! Sean Illing Right, that’s the pyramid! But the music is going to stop and the people at the bottom of the pyramid won’t have chairs to sit in. Jane Marie That’s absolutely right. But the people who traffic in these schemes think that’s fairness. They believe that not everyone’s going to have a chair to sit in and that makes sense to them. Not everyone gets to be a billionaire. Only the smartest, most hardworking people are billionaires, which we all know isn’t true. But that is a mindset. Sean Illing The other side of the wellness industry is also bullshit but it’s a little different. It’s the world of essential oils and supplements and tinctures and alternative therapies and that kind of stuff. Is someone like Gwyneth Paltrow patient zero for this particular disease, at least the modern version of it? Jane Marie In the modern era, yeah. I would say she is the poster woman for the wellness industry, and even she’s gotten in trouble for peddling garbage. She had that whole jade egg thing that you were supposed to put in your vagina. Sean Illing Why doesn’t the FDA regulate any of this stuff in the wellness supplement space? Could they do it even if they wanted to? Jane Marie They put boundaries around it a few times. We’ve created laws over the last hundred years or so around what constitutes food and drug. This distinction is important. What’s a food and what’s a drug? Well, a drug is something that is proven to treat, cure, or alleviate an ailment, and that has to be proven a certain way according to their guidelines. And then foods are things that keep you alive. So that leaves a lot of stuff out there that people can just make up and say, This’ll help with this or that. It’s not a drug and it’s not a food, but you probably want to drink it. Because it’s going to make you feel better, or in some way help . They do get in trouble every once in a while when people get sick. There’s been plenty of them that have been found to have high levels of lead or other poisonous metals, and then they get closed down after that. But the FDA doesn’t really have the bandwidth to check out every single bottle of vitamins. The trickiest thing about the vitamin stuff is you don’t know actually what’s in them. So if I’m going to buy vitamin C, vitamin C does nothing. I mean, you need it, but you don’t need thousands of milligrams a day and it’s not going to get rid of your cold. And so if that was what’s in the bottle, it’s fine to take it. It’s not going to kill you. But there is no agency that tests every different factory’s vitamin C or says, this is how much vitamin C is actually in that pill. And there have been plenty of cases of someone finally testing some bottle of vitamins from the grocery store and finding out, actually, there’s no vitamin C in here. It’s sugar or whatever. It’s like something else entirely.

"2","On Tuesday, a group of 2,000 Swiss women won a significant ruling on holding governments accountable for addressing climate change . The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found that Switzerland failed to implement sufficient climate policies — violating the women’s human rights. The case could influence other European countries, as well as other international bodies, in their decisions about the legal ramifications of inadequate climate policies. KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz , a group of women climate activists all over the age of 64, initially brought the case against Switzerland in November 2016. After eight years of litigation, Tuesday’s ruling establishes a pathway for European citizens and civil society groups to successfully sue their countries for better climate policy. That’s important because there are several pending climate change cases at the Court, which is based in Strasbourg, France, including a case against the Norwegian government alleging oil and gas exploration licenses violate citizens’ human rights. Establishing a precedent in the ECHR means that it could apply to the 45 other countries that are party to the European Convention on Human Rights. “We keep asking our lawyers, ‘Is that right?,’” Rosmarie Wydler-Wälti, a leader of KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz, told Reuters . “And they tell us, ‘It’s the most you could have had. The biggest victory possible.’” How did KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz win? The women’s strategy relied partly on their medical vulnerability as senior citizens to excessive heat caused by climate change. Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , among others, show that the Swiss population of senior women — especially those over 75 — are more prone to heat-related medical problems like “dehydration, hyperthermia, fatigue, loss of consciousness, heat cramps and heat strokes,” according to the group . Within Switzerland, they are also the most vulnerable to exacerbated health problems, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and kidney problems in excessive heat. “We are aware that older men, people with diseases as well as small children also suffer from heat waves and other climate effects,” the group wrote on its website . “By focusing on the proven particular susceptibility of us older women we are simply enhancing our lawsuit’s chances of success which is ultimately good for everyone.” Though the women’s suit only affects the law in Switzerland, their win could support similar frameworks to hold countries accountable in the Global South, especially in Latin America . The group, supported by Greenpeace, spent nearly eight years litigating its case in Swiss courts before going to the ECHR. “There is a principle [in international law] called the exhaustion of domestic remedies, which is that you’re supposed to have gone through the domestic system first,” Catherine Higham, a policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, told Vox in an interview. “The reason that the Court found that it could give an opinion there is that it found that ... the [Swiss] legal process had failed to give a remedy for what it identified as these violations of the convention rights.” That’s in contrast to another climate case rejected by the Court on Tuesday, in which six Portuguese young people went straight to the ECHR without going through the Portuguese legal system first. The children, who have suffered extreme heat waves and wildfires in their home country , also tried to sue 32 other nations in addition to Portugal. “It’s a plausible argument,” Higham said. “ And we’ve seen another international human rights body, the UN Committee on Climate Change, say that states could have extraterritorial obligations in the case of climate change, because it’s kind of fundamentally transboundary in nature.” The ECHR, though, found that the statute was applied too broadly. What happens now? Switzerland will now be obligated to update its climate change policies, but the ECHR can’t tell the Swiss government what policies must be implemented, Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told Vox. “It doesn’t provide a specific injunction or any specific direction — it just says that you have to be more consistent with what the climate science says, but with deference to the policy prerogatives and democratic processes of the Swiss government.” Switzerland has tried to curb its greenhouse gas emissions, introducing an amendment to its CO2 Act which would halve them by 2030 in comparison to 1990 levels. But a referendum to approve that amendment failed in 2021 . Voters later approved a measure to move away from imported oil and gas toward green energy alternatives in an effort to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. “The decision affirms that European Human Rights law ... requires governments to pursue a high level of climate ambition,” Burger said. Switzerland is likely to take the court’s decision seriously, Burger and Higham said, and it could encourage more domestic cases in countries that are party to the convention. It could also influence other international bodies, specifically the Inter-American Court on Human Rights , which is due to discuss an advisory opinion on climate change and human rights in the coming weeks. That could eventually create a legal framework for the body, which includes many Latin American and Caribbean countries significantly affected by climate change, to pursue cases like the KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz just won.

"2","Donald Trump has an abortion problem. The presumptive GOP nominee boasts an advantage over President Joe Biden on most of today’s most salient issues. In a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll , voters said that they trusted Trump over the president on the economy , inflation, crime, and immigration. Biden, meanwhile, enjoyed a double-digit advantage on only one issue: by 47 points to 35 points, voters said they trusted the president over Trump to handle abortion policy. It is not hard to see why. Trump’s presidency left relatively few lasting marks on American public policy. But as he has repeatedly boasted since the Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, it was his judicial appointments that enabled the overturning of Roe v. Wade — and thus, the avalanche of abortion bans that followed its demise. The most recent of these bans might be the most politically significant. On Tuesday, Arizona’s Supreme Court ruled that a 160-year-old law banning virtually all abortions in the state is enforceable. That statute predates Arizona’s existence as a state and was rendered irrelevant by Roe in 1973. For these reasons, the state’s Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs had declined to enforce the ban following Dobbs . But her state’s high court has now abruptly placed all abortion providers at risk of imprisonment; the law mandates two to five years of incarceration for anyone who aids in an abortion, unless that procedure is necessary to save the life of the pregnant person. In practice, this will shutter clinics across the swing state. And since Republicans control Arizona’s state legislature, it is unlikely that lawmakers will do anything to reverse the law before November, despite its extraordinary unpopularity (in a 2022 poll , 91 percent of Arizonans said abortion should be legal in all or some circumstances). A referendum on adding abortion rights to Arizona’s state constitution will likely appear on the ballot this November. The state supreme court’s decision is liable to increase both support and turnout for that ballot measure, while increasing the salience of abortion policy in the state — both developments that should aid President Biden’s campaign. Trump’s abortion problem isn’t limited to Arizona. When Texas forces a woman pregnant with a fatally ill fetus to carry it to term — even at the risk of suffering uterine rupture and infertility — that is a consequence of the Trump presidency. When a 10-year-old rape victim in Ohio must travel across state lines to have an abortion, that is a testament to Trump’s legacy. When Alabama disrupts fertility services by declaring that embryos have the same rights as people, those frozen bunches of cells have Trump to thank. Trump understands that all this is a major political liability. And on Monday, he tried to address it, releasing a video in which he details his vague — yet ostensibly moderate — new stance on abortion policy. If voters want to know what a second Trump administration would actually mean for abortion rights, however, they’d be better off looking to Trump’s past actions and current alliances, rather than his cheap words. The mogul avoided taking a clear stance on abortion throughout the 2024 GOP primary . Behind closed doors, he told his advisers that he liked the idea of a 16-week national abortion ban with exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. But in front of the cameras, he prevaricated, saying he could “live with” the procedure being banned nationwide or only in some states, while expressing opposition to Florida’s six-week abortion ban. Now, with the Republican nomination firmly in his grip, Trump is finally spelling out his official position on abortion — or at least, the line he plans to take into the general election. “My view is now that we have abortion where everyone wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both,” Trump said Monday morning in a video post on his social media platform Truth Social . “And whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.” The Republican went on to say that “many states will be different” and some will be more conservative than others, but “at the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people.” In other words, Trump suggested that he does not support a national abortion ban. He did not say precisely what abortion restrictions he would like to see his own home state of Florida implement. Trump did specify that he doesn’t think doctors should be allowed to kill newborn infants (although even in blue states, doctors are already legally prohibited from committing infanticide). And he evinced moral opposition to abortion in “the later months.” But exactly which months qualify as “later,” he didn’t say. Trump did, however, make clear that he believes that victims of rape or incest — or women at risk of dying in childbirth — should be exempt from all abortion restrictions. At the same time, the former president told viewers that he is “proudly the person responsible” for ending Roe v. Wade . Perhaps this was meant to remind his supporters on the Christian right that they owe him gratitude, his present complacency about the supposed mass murder of fetuses in blue states notwithstanding. But it was the one massively unpopular note in his carefully calibrated statement. The Biden campaign immediately clipped it . This said, Trump’s argument against Roe v. Wade rested on the idea that it was legally suspect, not morally wrong. This is not how most conservatives view that decision. Taken as a whole, Trump’s statement constitutes a sound political gambit. Given the constraints imposed by his coalition and record, “I think abortion policy should be left up to the states, although rape victims should always be able to get an abortion, and newborn babies shouldn’t be executed” is about the most expedient stance that Trump could take. It gestures at the median voter’s discomfort with late-term abortions without committing Trump to either a national ban or any specific state-level week limit. Ideally, the press would not allow Trump to sustain this strategic ambiguity. The likely GOP nominee is registered to vote in Florida, which will hold a referendum this November on whether to enshrine a right to an abortion until fetal viability (generally, around the 24th week of a pregnancy). Trump has said that he considers his state’s six-week abortion ban too extreme. He should tell voters whether he considers 24 weeks even more radical. Further, although Trump suggested that he doesn’t think abortion should be banned nationally, he did not say that he would veto a national abortion ban, if one made it to his desk. The media should keep asking what he would do in that circumstance. Of course, Trump’s word is less trustworthy than an email from a Nigerian prince . Once in office, Trump will face no binding political constraints, as he will be ineligible to run for another term. In the event that Republicans find a way to get a federal abortion ban through Congress , there is every reason to believe Trump will reward the Christian right’s loyalty. There is cause to doubt that the GOP will have the votes to pass such legislation (doing so would require the party to either abolish the legislative filibuster or assemble a 60-vote Senate majority). But a second Trump presidency would likely encroach on abortion rights nationwide through other means. As the New York Times reported in February, anti-abortion activists with close ties to Trump’s campaign have developed a wide array of plans for restricting reproductive freedom through executive action. Today, more than half of all abortions in the United States are induced by pills such as mifepristone . The existence of such drugs makes it more difficult for conservatives to fully stamp out abortion, even in red states. But Republicans believe that existing law gives the executive branch the authority to ban such pills nationwide. Some aim to achieve this by directing the FDA to rescind its approval of abortion-inducing drugs. Others are eyeing a little-known 1873 law called the Comstock Act. Long rendered a dead-letter statute by Roe , Comstock bans the delivery of “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.” Conservative legal scholar Jonathan F. Mitchell — who represented Trump before the Supreme Court last year — has suggested that Comstock bans not only the delivery of abortion pills , but of all the equipment required to conduct an abortion procedure. “We don’t need a federal ban when we have Comstock on the books,” Mitchell told the Times. Mitchell went on to say that he hoped Trump “doesn’t know about the existence of Comstock, because I just don’t want him to shoot off his mouth. I think the pro-life groups should keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the election.” Trump’s abortion messaging Monday is consistent with Mitchell’s advice. Voters should know that his administration’s policies would likely be the same.

"2","Editor’s note, April 9, 1:15 pm ET: On April 9, the Norfolk Southern railway company announced that it agreed to pay $600 million to settle a class-action lawsuit stemming from a February 2023 derailment of a train carrying hazardous materials in East Palestine , Ohio. The derailed train was carrying a variety of toxic chemicals, including vinyl chloride, which is used to make plastics. When the train derailed last year, hundreds of people were evacuated. Today, many residents remain concerned about contamination and say they do not trust the assurances they have received from Norfolk Southern; Norfolk Southern didn’t admit to any liability or wrongdoing as a result of the settlement. The settlement, which still needs to be approved by a district judge, will be used in part to support upgrades to drinking water infrastructure, community- directed projects, and economic development. The following article, published in March 2023 in the wake of the derailment, explains the fears that continue to preoccupy thousands of East Palestine residents. —Paige Vega, climate editor EAST PALESTINE, Ohio — The smell doesn’t hit you right away. On Market Street, the main commercial road in town, it smells of doughnuts and McDonald’s and exhaust. It’s only when the wind picks up, or you walk toward the western edge of town, that you can catch a whiff of the chemicals. Some say they smell like nail polish remover or super glue. To me, the odor was sweet, like a cheap fruity air freshener, with a bitter aftertaste. It has been over a month since a large train derailed here, sending up flames taller than buildings and spewing more than 100,000 gallons of toxic chemicals into the environment. Federal and local officials have been trying to clean up the mess. And for weeks, they’ve been assuring residents that the air and water are safe, according to monitoring. It won’t put the health of residents at risk, health officials have repeatedly said. Yet for many of them, East Palestine, a village of roughly 4,700 people, still doesn’t feel safe at all. You can’t blame them. In some parts of town, the scent of chemicals still hangs in the air. You can see pollution in the streams, which appears as an iridescent sheen on the water’s surface. Independent analyses complicate the scientific side of the story. Meanwhile, a large number of people have been complaining of headaches, coughing, and other symptoms in the wake of the derailment. This has many residents asking: How can East Palestine really be safe? A rainbow sheen is seen in a creek that runs through East Palestine called Leslie Run. Courtesy of Sam Hall And for some locals I talked to, East Palestine will never feel safe again — even as the smells dissipate, the creek clears up, and the throngs of neon-vested officials return home. East Palestine has been permanently tainted for them. “Feel safe in East Palestine? I don’t think it’s going to happen,” Wayne Bable, a retired mechanic who’s lived in town for the last three decades, told me one morning last week. Making a place feel safe after an environmental disaster like this is not just about analyzing the air and water, psychologists and risk communication experts said. Peace of mind requires building trust between residents and public officials and understanding that a sense of safety is rooted in feelings, emotions, and experiences — not just in data. That trust has been lost in East Palestine. And it’s far from the first case of environmental contamination to undermine faith in public services (see: Flint, Michigan ). So, what can we learn this time? The unsurprising reasons residents still don’t feel safe in East Palestine The smell of chemicals worsens as you approach Brushville Supply, a store on the eastern edge of town that sells hoses, sanders, and other tools. It’s just over 500 feet from the tracks and in eyeshot of where the train derailed. I could see some of the derailed cars from a hill just outside the shop. “I get headaches every time I come over here,” said Austin Huffman, who works at Brushville Supply, his family’s business. “During the weekends, it goes away.” There is a strong scientific case that the air and water are safe in East Palestine. Many of the chemicals that spilled into the environment, such as vinyl chloride, can indeed be dangerous, but testing of indoor and outdoor air quality has consistently indicated that they’re not present in harmful quantities. The same is true for the village’s drinking water. But that doesn’t match the experience of Huffman and other residents. Medical professionals recently surveyed 168 East Palestine residents who visited a local health clinic, and nearly three- quarters of them reported having headaches in the wake of the wreck. More than half of them reported coughing or skin irritation. The enormous gulf between official statements and how people are feeling is one reason why the dozen or so residents I talked to simply don’t trust anything public health officials are saying. Further eroding that trust (and adding confusion) are results from independent air quality testing that detected levels of a potentially harmful chemical called acrolein that “occasionally rose above safety thresholds for long-term health concerns.” Dead fish found in Leslie Run, a creek that runs through East Palestine. Courtesy of Sam Hall A dead frog in Leslie Run. Courtesy of Sam Hall Another daily reality making residents feel unsafe is what they’re seeing in the water. One afternoon last week, I visited Bable’s property south of town, which is situated adjacent to a creek called Leslie Run that snakes through East Palestine. Using a hoe, Bable turned over a large rock in the stream. A rainbow slick bloomed on the surface. Those are chemicals from the derailment, Bable said. (I wasn’t able to verify that those iridescent slicks were chemicals, but they align with similar reports .) This creek is normally teeming with minnows and crayfish, Bable told me, as he continued to pick up rocks. We didn’t see any. “They’re all dead,” he said, as a result of the spill. So far, wildlife officials estimate that the chemical spill has killed more than 43,000 aquatic animals including fish, frogs, and crayfish. Wayne Bable, a longtime resident of East Palestine, stands near Leslie Run, just south of town. Benji Jones/Vox These visual cues that residents are witnessing are incredibly powerful in shaping the perception of risk, according to Paul Slovic, a risk psychologist at the University of Oregon. “People are responding to their senses,” he said. “The smell is bad, there’s stuff in the water. That creates a feeling of vulnerability, of exposure, or lack of safety.” Some locals see East Palestine as permanently tainted As spring carries on, the stench of chemicals in the air will continue to subside. The fish will likely return to the creeks (I saw a small school of minnows far downstream). More complete chemical testing is likely to continue to indicate that the environment is free of harmful levels of contaminants. Nonetheless, some residents may never feel safe. Wayne Bable’s wife, Gail, has resided in East Palestine for more than four decades. They live about a mile and a half from the derailment, though she can see the train tracks from her kitchen window. “I’ve been up since 3 o’clock in the morning listening to the trains go by,” she said. Gail says she won’t feel fully safe unless she moves out of town. Nearly everyone I spoke to knew at least one person who moved away and doesn’t plan to come back. (Gail and Wayne own three properties in the region, which makes it hard to just pick up and leave, she said.) Several of the derailed cars can be seen on the western edge of East Palestine. AP East Palestine is a conservative town; you can see Trump signs everywhere. In the 2020 election , the former president won nearly 72 percent of the vote in East Palestine’s Columbiana County. That could influence their feelings of safety: Polling data shows that Republicans have very little trust in the federal government, compared to Democrats (though neither political party reports feeling a large amount of trust.) “I don’t trust our government,” Wayne Bable said. “I will never trust our government.” But regardless of someone’s politics, Slovic said, their sense of safety often has more to do with feelings and emotions than it does any data analysis. That’s why more scientific data may not return the sense of safety to town. “Risk exists in us mostly as a gut feeling, not as a calculation,” he said. “They feel that their community is contaminated. When you have that image in your mind — of contamination — you can’t be comfortable. People are relying on thoughts and feelings that are very hard to get rid of.” “When you have that image in your mind — of contamination — you can’t be comfortable” A better way to deal with environmental disasters It’s hard for residents to feel safe after a severe environmental disaster like this, no matter how public officials respond. But critics say that those officials also made mistakes that sowed distrust — mistakes that we can learn from. A few days after the train wreck, Ohio officials ordered many East Palestine residents to evacuate before burning off a large amount of vinyl chloride that they said was at risk of exploding. The controlled burn created an apocalyptic scene: a giant tower of thick, dark smoke rising above the village. Just two days later, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced , along with the local fire chief, that residents could safely return home. Air quality monitoring, he said, didn’t detect harmful levels of pollution in the air around the derailment. A plume of dark smoke rises over East Palestine from a controlled detonation of vinyl chloride. Gene J. Puskar/AP That announcement — that it’s completely safe — made some residents suspicious and untrusting of health officials. The decision was based on preliminary testing, which many residents and outside experts consider incomplete. Some scientists have also questioned whether those early tests were sensitive enough to capture low quantities of chemicals that could be harmful, especially when present alongside a melange of other compounds. And again, people were experiencing a range of symptoms when they returned home, including headaches. One problem was that the announcement lacked nuance and transparency, according to James Fabisiak, a toxicologist and public health expert at the University of Pittsburgh. It wasn’t clear what officials knew and what they didn’t, and what that might mean for residents. Transparent communication is essential following any environmental disaster, added Ellen Peters, a decision psychologist and communications expert at the University of Oregon. “Treat people respectfully as adults who can make decisions in their own lives,” Peters said. “People are being patted on the head and told everything is fine, [but health officials] haven’t provided enough information for people to believe that it’s fine. To discount what it looks like compared to what the experts presumably believe doesn’t go over well with people.” Daniel Tierney, a spokesperson for Gov. DeWine, told Vox that claims that the February 8 announcement lacked transparency are “hogwash.” The decision was ultimately made by the East Palestine fire chief, Tierney said, though the governor agreed with it. There were air and water experts available to address questions at the press conference, he said. Tierney confirmed that the testing prior to the announcement was preliminary, though he said that “we’ve never had a test that’s come back [since] with any level of concern for short-term exposure.” Tierney said that the tests were sensitive enough to detect chemicals at levels of concern in the short term. Following a disaster like this, it’s also important to give residents plenty of opportunities to voice their concerns and include them in the decision-making process, said Alison Adams, an environmental risk expert at the University of Florida. Communication should be flowing both ways, not just from public officials to residents, she said. The challenge now facing public officials in East Palestine is building back trust. Better communication can help, experts say, but it probably won’t go far enough to reinstate a feeling of safety. Perhaps, Slovic says, officials can give residents access to independent experts who have their interests at heart and can carry out independent testing. “That’s the only hope for this,” he said. Ultimately, disaster response needs to extend beyond cleaning up chemicals, Slovic said. Officials should be more mindful about the communication of risk and the psychology of residents. “There’s a need to integrate the psychology and sociology here with the scientific analysis,” Slovic said. “You can’t divorce the two.” Eventually, the feeling of safety may return to residents who’ve lost it, without much intervention. People will follow their senses, Peters said. “What they hopefully are going to start to see is that things are getting cleaned up, that things are starting to look more like normal, that their headaches are going away,” she said, and “that other people are saying, ‘I feel okay.’” Will you support Vox today?

"2","Just outside St. Louis, in the inner-ring suburb of University City, there’s a little neighborhood often called the region’s unofficial Chinatown. Growing up in the area, it was one of my favorite places to be; reflective of the city’s diversity and vitality, it opened up the world to me. This past December, when I went home for the holidays, I discovered that what was once a beloved strip of immigrant- and minority-owned businesses there — a Korean grocery, a pho shop, a Jamaican joint with vegetarian options, a Black-owned barber shop — had been bulldozed and replaced by a double-lane drive-through Chick-fil-A. Part of the strip of small businesses in University City’s Jeffrey Plaza that were torn down to build a new development. Aubrey Byron for Vox The new Chick- fil-A. Aubrey Byron for Vox Across the street, another strip was torn down to make way for a Raising Cane’s and a Chipotle, both also equipped with drive- throughs. This part of town was never exactly the height of urban design; it had long been sprawly, car-oriented, and not great for walking. But the redevelopment gave it another character entirely. Before, the businesses there were destinations you could walk to if you wanted. Now, an enormous concrete retaining wall was built outside the Chick-fil-A, closing it off from sidewalk access like a fortress to fast food capitalism. The place had become so hostile to anyone outside a car that no one was going to get in there on foot. It was not a destination, but a place meant to be driven through — which is to say, no place at all. A Chick-fil-A drive-through in University City, Missouri. Aubrey Byron for Vox Although this particular city block had sentimental value to me, there’s nothing unique about what happened to it; it’s a pattern taking place across the country. Post-Covid, drive-throughs are proliferating among traditional fast food restaurants (Burger King, Taco Bell, KFC) as well as more upmarket brands not traditionally associated with that way of doing business, like Chipotle , Shake Shack , and Sweetgreen . Dining rooms are out and two-, three-, and even four-lane drive-throughs — mega drive-throughs — are in. “Drive-throughs have been around a long time,” Charles Marohn , a former traffic engineer and well-known critic of America’s car-dependent urban planning, told me. Today, he said, “they’re becoming bigger and more obnoxious.” That trend conflicts with a key objective that US cities are increasingly prioritizing : creating a safer, cleaner, walkable, livable urban environment that’s less dependent on cars. St. Louis and its suburbs, for example, in recent years have been building out bike lanes and walking and biking paths , including a segment that runs right up to the site of the new fried chicken and Chipotle drive-throughs. Where, exactly, are the people walking or biking that path supposed to go when they arrive at a development designed to be navigated only by car? Drive-throughs, perhaps more than any other single building style, work against these livability goals. They worsen traffic congestion and release climate-warming air pollution from cars idling in line. They force cities to devote more land to asphalt, contributing to costly and unproductive sprawl. And they increase the chances of collisions with pedestrians and cyclists —in a country that already has one of the highest car crash death rates among peer countries — because they require cuts in the sidewalk to accommodate cars going in and out. “Every time you have a curb cut, you’re creating an additional vehicle-pedestrian conflict point,” Minneapolis planning director Meg McMahan told Vox. “So there’s very real impacts to pedestrian safety.” 20 people showing up at a coffee shop by foot, bike, or transit, and it's good business and place you might want to hang out. 20 people showing up by car and it's a disaster, not a place you want to be, and will probably incite some road rage/frappuccino incident. pic.twitter.com/xuLWIGjgwq — Maris Zivarts (@emveezee) November 23, 2021 On top of everything that’s already suboptimal about what urban planners call the American built environment, “the drive-through just kicks you in the nuts,” Marohn said. “It’s like, we’re going to actually add the added bonus that you can’t walk here at all because it’s really dangerous. ... That’s what the drive-through does: It magnifies the negativity.” Why the fast food industry loves drive-throughs Drive-throughs have long made up a large volume of fast food businesses’ sales, but when Covid-19 caused dine-in options to shut down, even more Americans flocked to them. “A brand like McDonald’s or Wendy’s, they generally have like 70 percent of business flow through the drive-through. And then it became 90, then it was 95,” Danny Klein, editorial director of QSR, a trade magazine covering the quick-service restaurant industry, told me. “You had this wave of consumers go to the drive-through and be introduced to it, and it’s just held as a bit of a habit that hasn’t gone away.” In 2022, drive- throughs accounted for about 75 percent of fast food restaurants’ revenue, Vox’s Whizy Kim reported last year. For the drive-through haters, this highlights an uncomfortable truth: Drive-throughs are widespread and growing because tons of people use them. In a society that’s already built around driving everywhere, there’s some logic to this. They’re fast and convenient, and they can have a certain Americana charm . The National Restaurant Association reports that half of Americans use them at least once a week. I occasionally use a drive-through pharmacy because it’s so easy to do when I’m already en route to the grocery store; I’ve used drive-throughs to get tested for Covid multiple times (including one occasion, also in St. Louis, when I tried to walk up to a drive-through window and was refused service). In the quick-service food sector, drive-throughs are now practically a requirement for staying competitive, and more businesses are adopting them. Chipotle started experimenting with drive-throughs, which it calls “Chipotlanes,” in 2018 and has been aggressively expanding them post-pandemic. The company is on track to open its 1,000th Chipotlane this year (out of its 3,400-some locations), according to an emailed statement attributed to chief brand officer Chris Brandt. Chipotle just reported one of its best quarters ever, Klein told me, managing to increase its guest count, which is rare in the fast food industry. “Part of that is the accessibility that they’ve opened up across the country with these Chipotlanes,” Klein said. Chipotlanes are digital-only, meaning that rather than ordering food on arrival, customers place orders online ahead of time and just arrive to pick them up, allowing the line to move much more quickly than at conventional drive-throughs (and, Brandt said, helping avoid traffic pile-ups). It’s like a take-out order, except you pick it up in your car. This drive-through system also makes business run more smoothly from Chioptle’s perspective; orders are filled on a separate assembly line where staff can “quickly and efficiently execute online orders without disrupting throughput on the front line,” Brandt said. The rise of online order-ahead systems helps explain why drive-throughs have become even more popular in recent years: It’s made it even faster and more frictionless to pick up food. Some brands that have long offered traditional drive-throughs, like Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell , are adding dedicated lanes for mobile orders made in advance — part of what’s causing mega drive- throughification. For chain restaurants, it’s easy to see why these developments look like progress: They make fast food consumption in car- dependent regions more efficient. But that efficiency is achieved at a heavy cost to people and communities. The hidden costs of drive-throughs One way of looking at the economics of a drive-through is that it derives its value from sucking value out of everything else. Drive-throughs consign land that could otherwise be put to more productive use to be slabs of asphalt for car lanes. Many US municipalities have parking minimums, so building a drive-through on top of the legally mandated number of parking spots means “you have to essentially double the amount of space that’s dedicated to vehicles,” McMahan, the Minneapolis planning director, told me — and that’s just for drive- throughs with a single lane. Because drive-throughs wrap around a restaurant, they usually only work with businesses housed in detached standalone buildings — rather than stores lined up together along a strip — wasting even more land. They depend on road infrastructure that’s expensive for cities to maintain, and they’re notorious for backing up onto streets, stalling traffic, and creating hazards for other road users. “If you put a drive-through on a good street ... you’re wrecking the walkability of that street, you’re wrecking the financial productivity of that street, you’re wrecking that street as a place,” Marohn said. And it’s no coincidence, he added, that drive-throughs are almost invariably linked with large fast food chains that siphon wealth out of local economies. “The types of businesses that do well in a drive- through environment are the types that mine capital from a community.” Some of the remaining businesses (near the new and still-expanding redevelopment) in St. Louis’s unofficial Chinatown. Aubrey Byron for Vox A bus stop outside Chick-fil-A. Aubrey Byron for Vox For small businesses without massive amounts of capital to invest, drive-throughs generally don’t make economic sense, Klein explained. “You’re competing with the Starbucks of the world if you’re trying to get that kind of lot [that can accommodate a drive-through]. Most smaller brands aren’t even willing to attempt that,” he said. The technology to make drive-throughs work is also costly, like speaker boxes and headsets. “If you’re someone like Chipotle, it’s just a different game of money. They’re really not worried about that upfront cost to the degree that a smaller brand would be.” When I asked urban planner Joe Minicozzi what he thought about drive-throughs, he told me I was asking the wrong question. “What about them?” he said. “They suck.” And he’s right: Drive-throughs are not single-handedly responsible for the design choices that have made much of the US so dependent on cars, to the detriment of our safety, our quality of life , and the planet. If we got rid of all drive-throughs tomorrow, American communities would still be defined by sprawl, perilous roads , and massive parking lots . The more fundamental problem, as Minicozzi sees it, is the system that allows and even encourages developers and big business to waste so much precious land on economically unproductive sprawl, ultimately forcing the public to pay for it in the form of road maintenance. “Why are we just trashing big chunks of our city as economic wastelands?” he said. Still, if you’re looking for a totem of America’s “heinous land uses,” as the urban planning YouTuber Ray Delahanty put it , drive-throughs are not a bad choice. “They’re really significant design drivers,” McMahan said, requiring cities to build in a way that’s highly car-centric to accommodate drive-through traffic. It adds up to an urban landscape that is, almost paradoxically, vast yet dominated by placelessness. Americans spend much of their days traversing non-places — settings for the movement and storage of cars rather than for humans to linger — making social connection “exhaustingly difficult,” as Muizz Akhtar put it in Vox, and contributing to our loneliness epidemic . “A good part of any day in Los Angeles is spent driving, alone, through streets devoid of meaning to the driver,” Joan Didion wrote in 1989 of the consistently temperate region that somehow represents the apotheosis of car dependence and drive-throughs . “Such tranced hours are, for many people who live in Los Angeles, the dead center of being there.” Cities are increasingly wary of drive-throughs In 2019, Minneapolis became the most high-profile US city to ban construction of new drive-throughs, as part of its plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. “We knew based on studies that had been done nationwide that there are higher rates of air pollution in places where vehicles are idling,” McMahan said. Residents had long complained about drive-through lines spilling out onto city roads, she added, and they were more broadly at odds with the city’s livability goals. Before the city banned new drive-throughs (and parking minimums , which were eliminated two years later), McMahan said, “probably 50 percent of the time that we spent on a site was spent figuring out how vehicles were going to get in, be stored, and get out. And now we spend zero percent of our time thinking about that. ... That means that time gets to be allocated to things like good-quality design and creating a better urban fabric.” Atlanta recently prohibited new drive-throughs near its BeltLine, a system of walking and cycling trails, as a pedestrian safety measure. Some smaller cities and suburban communities, like Orchard Park, New York, have also banned them; in San Luis Obispo, California, they’ve been illegal for more than 40 years. Other cities are weighing drive-through bans and partial bans — a question that may become more urgent as drive-throughs expand their reach. Last year, the National Restaurant Association reported on local drive-through bans as a “developing issue.” But big city restrictions may not end up mattering much, Klein told me, because the fast food industry sees its future in regions that are friendlier to the drive-through style of development. “They all want to go to the suburbs now,” he said. “That’s where I think you’ll see the very, very vast majority of their growth going forward.” That’s consistent with what Brandt of Chipotle told me about the company’s expansion plans. “Small towns have been a major focus of our growth strategy over the last few years,” he wrote. “Chipotlanes allow us to enter these markets with a familiar and convenient access point for suburban families.” This leaves suburban communities that are in the fast food industry’s crosshairs, like University City, with hard choices to make about what they want their future to look like. The city’s 2013 Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan had set a goal of making “University City the St. Louis region’s premier walk-able and bike-able city by creating a community with universal accessibility and transportation alternatives that enable residents, no matter their age or ability, to walk and bike to their destinations.” The new Market at Olive development will eventually be a larger, sprawling complex. Aubrey Byron for Vox This is hard to reconcile with a development pattern that’s tearing down local businesses to build fast food drive- throughs. Individual businesses will always come and go — and that in itself isn’t a problem — but city leaders have a duty to think deeply about what kinds of places they want to foster. Reached for comment, Bwayne Smotherson, a University City council member who represents the ward where the new development opened, pointed to the economic benefits he believes it will have for the community (the city committed $70 million in tax increment financing to subsidize the project). He added that he wasn’t familiar with the environmental concerns with drive-throughs but that he considers the development accessible to pedestrians and cyclists. “The wall is simply a design and function feature and not at all a barrier,” Smotherson wrote in an email, referring to the retaining walls in front of Chick-fil-A and Costco. It’s technically true that pedestrians can access the businesses if they’re very determined — but that really stretches the definition of walkable. Drive- throughs are wildly popular in the US, Marohn said, because Americans are already traveling through environments where it feels unnatural and unpleasant to be outside a car; the drive-through just represents the logical culmination of building places for cars rather than for humans. The University City local businesses had already been hemmed in by such non-places that didn’t help them realize their potential, making them vulnerable to replacement. A genuine alternative, Marohn said, would go a lot deeper than ditching drive-throughs. It would mean creating places where no one would think to miss them — places where people actually want to be.

"2","Jorge Vargas’s family has always wanted him to be the first to go to college. They left St. Paul, Minnesota, for their home country of Honduras last year, but Jorge stayed behind with an aunt to pursue higher education. But recently, the 18-year-old senior at St. Paul’s Washington Technology Magnet School has been considering another option: the military. “Just because it would be a decent paying job straight out of high school, that’s the only thing I like about it,” Jorge told me in a recent interview for the Today, Explained podcast. “I’ve never been much of a patriot.” Lots of young people are looking for college alternatives these days. A recent Gallup poll found that just 36 percent of Americans had confidence in higher education, down from 57 percent in 2015. The reasons for that shift are complicated but according to Inside Higher Ed reporter Liam Knox, it’s largely been driven by exactly what’s on Jorge’s mind — higher education’s ever-increasing price tag. “There’s a lot of hay made about college’s political perception problem … The things that dominate not just right-wing media, but mainstream media and liberal media as well, [like] campus culture wars,” Knox told Today, Explained. “But when most Americans say they don’t feel confident in the value of college, they’re not talking about those issues. They’re talking about money.” Undergraduate enrollment nationwide has fallen by about 15 percent since 2010 , though much of that decline has been driven by demographics: 2010 was the peak of when millennials, America’s largest living generation , went off to college. But for Jorge — and Americans like him who share his concerns — one state has taken steps to make a college degree a little more attractive. How Minnesota put its money where its mouth is Up until last year, enrollment trends at Minnesota state universities pretty much mirrored national ones. Enrollment there peaked in 2011, then started gradually falling. “That rather steady decline then hit Covid,” said Minnesota State Chancellor Scott Olson, “and institutions like ours were impacted pretty strongly by that.” Between 2018 and 2022, the number of undergraduates enrolled at Minnesota State four-year institutions fell by nearly 10,000 — 20 percent of their total undergraduate enrollment. The community colleges also lost 20 percent of their undergraduate enrollment, totaling more than 20,000 students. (The University of Minnesota, which is more selective, is operated independently; undergraduate enrollment there stayed steady until around 2020, then began declining as well.) But then something unexpected happened: in November 2022, Minnesota Democrats flipped the state’s Senate and retained control of the House and the governorship, giving them a legislative “trifecta” for the first time in a decade. The Democrats’ majorities were thin, but the Minnesotans managed to avoid the bickering that bogged down Joe Biden and the national Democrats during that time. Instead they went on a progressive speedrun , passing legislation that enshrined abortion rights, legalized cannabis, and mandated paid sick time . They also utilized the state’s budget surplus to pump a historic amount of money into higher education. It will pay for tuition freezes at many of the state’s public colleges and universities, and the North Star Promise Scholarship program , which pays tuition and fees for every Minnesota resident whose household makes less than $80,000 a year to go to an in-state public college or university after all other scholarships and grants are applied. “We have a crying need in Minnesota, and I think across the United States, for workers in all sorts of jobs, whether it’s nursing, doctors, teachers, we need skilled employees,” state Rep. Gene Pelowski Jr., who chairs the Minnesota House’s Higher Education Finance and Policy Committee, told Today, Explained. “So how do we turn this declining enrollment around? How do we invest in a way where we’re going to get skilled workers?” North Star Promise won’t start paying out until this fall, but state leaders believe it’s already having an impact. Enrollment is up slightly across the Minnesota state system this year. And applications are up nearly 20 percent for next fall. Olson said those schools are leaning into the cost cuts in their marketing. “You will see lots of billboards and social media with perhaps the mascot of a particular school with icicles coming off their nose or beak and the words ‘tuition freeze’ being tied-in,” Olson said. “And that undoubtedly has an effect on those applications that we’ve seen go up.” Colin Peters, a college coordinator with the Career Pathway Center at Washington Technology High School, said many of the students he works with who are eligible for North Star Promise are also eligible for other scholarships, but the simplicity of the new program makes the whole process a lot less intimidating. “Instead of walking through the nuance[s] of Pell Grant, state grant, institutional aid, I can say if your family makes under $80,000, public institutions of higher learning in Minnesota will be covered fully. So that is just an easy access point.” Minnesota’s moves are making waves with its neighbors, too. North Dakota recently announced its own version of the North Star Promise program , while South Dakota i s lowering tuition for Minnesota residents. “Any time that we can tick off one of our adjacent states and have them forced to do a program we’re doing, I think we’re having great success,” Pelowski said. Jorge’s dilemma Jorge Vargas’s financial aid offers are finally starting to roll in. And he got good news: If he chooses to study in-state, his tuition will be covered 100 percent through the North Star Promise program. No need to join the military. But he’s still having trouble making a decision. His heart is set on college at Loyola Marymount University, in sunny Los Angeles. “My parents want me to stay in the state. They’re like, ‘why would you put yourself in thousands of dollars in debt?’ But I really want to get out, so I don’t know.” Jorge said. “I wish the North Star Promise covered the whole country … particularly LA.” Be sure to follow Today, Explained on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Pandora , or wherever you listen to podcasts.

"2","In another major licensing grab for Netflix , HBO’s juggernaut Sex and the City officially landed on the platform this month. Older fans of the show are already anticipating the possibility of Gen Z’s horrified reaction to the raunchy and, in some ways, culturally outdated show. Can today’s youth stomach Carrie’s confusion over bisexuality or the women’s obsession with thinness? Will “ puriteens ” be scandalized watching Samantha Jones hook up with a random delivery guy? Lest we forget, Sex and the City has been available to stream for years . So the idea that teenagers and early 20-somethings have never engaged with the series before is a little presumptuous. (They’ve surely encountered some fashion inspo TikToks .) Rather, it seems like this move to Netflix has given everyone a chance to reignite the now-decades-long discourse about the show’s storylines and characters. It’s only natural then that social media users are already firing off takes about Carrie Bradshaw . To be fair, fans are never not discussing the show’s polarizing protagonist. In the years during and after the show aired in 1998, Carrie was largely celebrated as a feminist triumph — the rare single, childless (and messy) woman in her 30s portrayed in a (somewhat) aspirational light. “We had never seen female characters date this way or talk this way before on television,” says Jennifer Keishin Armstrong, author of Sex and the City and Us: How Four Single Women Changed the Way We Think, Live, and Love . “Carrie was at its center, which is a position often reserved for the sane, grounded, most relatable one.” However, the 2010s saw a wave of essays and criticism reevaluating her character — mostly by emphasizing her more annoying qualities — which the show occasionally downplayed. Was Carrie ever the ideal image of female independence, or just a self-absorbed, self-destructive nightmare? In 2024, the latter opinion has become more of a default perspective , and the primary lens through which many fans seem to enjoy the show. How did this anti-Carrie sentiment come to consume so much of the discourse surrounding SATC — a lighthearted but textually rich show with an abundance of interesting talking points, a slew of actual villains, and three other complex main characters? Is Carrie Bradshaw really that bad? On one hand, the nonstop Carrie criticisms feel a bit reflexive, more like a meme than an actual analysis of merit. On the other hand, she’s given audiences a lot to be frustrated with over six seasons, from her surprising prudishness to her pathetic longing for her main love interest, Mr. Big. Critics tend to highlight her self-centered tendencies, including cheating on her boyfriend Aidan and having an affair with Big while he was engaged to another woman. Vox’s Alex Abad-Santos writes that Carrie’s essentially the blueprint for what the internet has labeled “main character syndrome,” citing a season four episode — one I consider useless plot filler — where she expected her friend Charlotte to sell her engagement ring to loan her thousands of dollars. More recent TikToks and tweets have used Carrie as an informal case study in insufferable and even “toxic” behavior. In one TikTok , songwriter and content creator Kady Brown (@KadyzRoxz), who makes videos about relationships and mental health , argues that Carrie surpasses the threshold of a “complicated character.” Rather, she considers her a “master manipulator” and “narcissist.” @kadyroxz What if I told you Carrie & Big were equally yoked? #satc #carriebradshaw #femalefriendship #narcissisticabuse ♬ original sound - KadyRoxz Brown, 30, tells Vox that she first watched SATC when she was 22. However, in revisiting the show in her late 20s with a “fully developed frontal lobe,” she was met with “an undeniable ick of Carrie.” “I love the series,” she says. “I love most of the women. But, as a proper adult who believes she’s done her healing work, nothing could divorce me from the idea that Carrie has to be stopped!” Brown says, in her rewatch, she was mainly struck by the way Carrie argues with her friends, and she sees the character as an “externalizer.” “Carrie’s weaponized Miranda’s trust issues to avoid accountability in conversations about Big,” she said, referencing a season three episode. “And when Charlotte told Carrie it was a mistake to have dinner with her ex-boyfriend while married to Big, Carrie brought up Charlotte’s fear of being cheated on.” Other fans, like 30-year-old Katherine D. Morgan, an author and SATC watcher since her teens, argue that Carrie’s bad qualities are overstated within the fandom, especially compared to other faulty characters like Charlotte and Samantha — the latter of whom she says is also an “asshole.” Additionally, she says the term “narcissist” is “thrown around way too freely.” “Carrie’s the main character, so, of course, she talks about herself a lot,” Morgan says. “She’s a flawed human being,” she says. “Some people are bad at handling money. Some people date people who aren’t the best for them. Sometimes, those people are your best friends. So if you’re saying this person is terrible, you could also say the people you associate with are terrible.” Davis, Parker, Nixon, and Cattrall in Sex and the City: The Movie on September 21, 2007. Brian Ach/WireImage The harsh reactions to Carrie’s antics are particularly interesting to see today. In 2024, the “unlikable” protagonist whose life is in shambles is a common leading archetype in many female-driven television comedies, like Sam in the Bridget Everett vehicle Somebody Somewhere or Brooke Dubek in the recently concluded The Other Two . In 2022, the New York Times noticed an increasing appetite for female protagonists “who undermine their own growth” and are “more likely to be mired in failure than striving toward wedding rings and corner offices” — much like Carrie throughout SATC. Love her or hate her, Carrie Bradshaw and her no-good decisions are responsible for some of our favorite irresponsible women on TV. Subsequent HBO shows like 2013’s Girls and 2016’s Insecure — as well the Emmy-winning Prime Video show Fleabag , which also premiered in 2016 — relied on this archetype and gained popularity for their honest, sometimes brutal depictions of youngish womanhood. This expectation has taken over reality TV , too. People tune into Bravo’s Real Housewives franchise primarily to watch women make bad decisions and behave in transgressive ways. Morgan notes that the way viewers are trained to watch SATC, compared to other shows, could also have to do with this strong repulsion toward Carrie. The famous question of “Are you a Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, or Charlotte?” can make consuming the show a more self- reflective experience, like filling out a personality questionnaire. “People think that if they can identify with Carrie that suddenly means they’re a godawful person,” Morgan says. Viewers who initially approach the show this way may misunderstand Carrie — and the rest of the women — as characters who are solely meant to be aspirational, relatable avatars as opposed to categorical “antiheroines.” The “antihero” title is often more readily thrown at male protagonists who are violent and/or less morally ambiguous, such as Tony Soprano, Walter White, Dexter Morgan, and Don Draper — even though Carrie, as Keishin Armstrong says, came before all of them. “She was one of TV’s first, if not the first, true TV antiheroine,” Keishin Armstrong says. “She smoked. She drank. She was absolutely excruciating to watch as she chased after Big.” “I was longing for more flawed female characters at the time, which was still very much the era of sunny chick lit and rom-com heroines,” she says. “Their worst flaws were that they were clumsy or shopped too much.” (In Carrie’s case, being an occasional klutz and a shopping addict were the least of her problems.) Carrie sucks. So what? That said, it’s hard not to attribute at least some of the compulsive nitpicking of Carrie to sexist attitudes. Compared to the male mobsters on The Sopranos or Don Draper — who are babygirlified online and met with lighthearted takes about their sex appeal — there seems to be an expectation that Carrie should have a strong moral character. (When weighed against murderers and serial misogynists, she does.) She even somehow gets a worse rap than the terrible men on SATC , like Big, a middle-aged fuckboy, or Aidan, who took her back after she cheated on him just to emotionally torment her. Overall, these repeated declarations of Carrie’s “awfulness” seem to misunderstand her flaws as a bug and not a feature of a show about a group of rich, solipsistic white women. There’s a valid argument that it’s pleasant to watch characters grow and reflect on their mistakes. For example, Carrie’s continually misguided antics in Sex and the City 2 and the Max reboot And Just Like That… feel like legitimate failures in the progression of her arc. However, watching the original series solely through anti-Carrie goggles is missing the point and half the humor of the partly surreal and ridiculous show. Likewise, would a more refined, less “delulu” version of Carrie result in an equally compelling and outrageous series? Morgan argues no, claiming that “nothing would’ve happened” if it weren’t for Carrie acting out on her insecurities and constantly ignoring red flags. At the very least, Carrie gave viewers something to talk about and debate together. There’s also a fine line between a character being unlikable and unwatchable. Based on the sheer amount of people who love and repeatedly watch SATC, Carrie seemingly doesn’t fit into the latter category. That also rings true for content creator Brown, who says that Carrie doesn’t entirely spoil the show for her. Maybe this is because Carrie’s less pleasant attributes largely result in self-sabotage — which she miraculously tends to bounce back from — rather than causing harm to her friends. While she’s occasionally gotten into tiffs with the other women, as they all have, she remains a well-qualified lead character in a love story about the ups and downs of female friendship. Similarly, Morgan believes that Carrie is mostly a “good friend,” recalling how she supported Samantha during her breast cancer diagnosis and Charlotte after her miscarriage. “Everyone reaches out to her. ” On a more basic note, Keishin Armstrong says that Carrie just seems like an amusing person to have in your friend circle. “I think of Carrie as that friend whose choices you always roll your eyes at, but you’re friends with anyway,” she says. “She gets you into good parties and clubs and always has some entertaining story about how much her life sucks, even if it’s probably her fault.” Will you support Vox today?

"2","Today, the parents of the 2021 Michigan school shooter will cross a grim legal threshold: They will be the first parents in American history to be sentenced for their own criminal responsibility in relation to a mass shooting committed by their child. In separate trials held earlier this year, Jennifer and James Crumbley were each found guilty of four counts of involuntary manslaughter after their son opened fire in the hallways of his school, Oxford High School, in Michigan on November 30, 2021 — just hours after school administrators had summoned the Crumbleys to campus to alert them that their son seemed to be having violent fantasies. The Crumbleys face up to 15 years in prison for their roles in the crime. Their son, who was 15 years old at the time of the shooting, was sentenced in December to life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have asked the judge in the trials to sentence both Crumbleys to at least 10 years. Although the case is precedent-setting, gun rights advocates haven’t really embraced it as a cause, likely due to the troubling circumstances that led up to the shooting. Prosecutors had argued that James and Jennifer Crumbley, both strident gun enthusiasts, enabled their son to commit the shooting in three key ways: by continually ignoring what should have been warning signs regarding his mental health , by purchasing a firearm they intended for him to illegally own, and by failing to secure the gun away from him — even after school officials alerted them to the problem. In other words, the very facts that made prosecutors charge the Crumbleys and handed them their precedent-setting convictions might also limit that precedent’s reach. The Michigan shooter’s parents ignored an alarming series of warning signs — and arguably enabled their son’s violence According to an independent report released by the school district in October, multiple people failed at multiple points to prevent the 2021 shooting. For months prior, the Crumbleys’ son, Ethan Crumbley, repeatedly asked his parents for help handling his mental health and showed signs of depression and mental illness. In texts sent to them, for example, he exhibited growing paranoia and complained multiple times of seeing ghosts or demons in their home when he was alone. But the Crumbleys ignored or dismissed his concerns. “I actually asked my dad to take [me] to the Doctor yesterday but he just gave me some pills and told me to ‘Suck it up,’” Ethan texted a friend in April 2021. “My mom laughed when I told her.” James and Jennifer Crumbley at the time of arrest. Courtesy Detroit Police Four days before the shooting, James Crumbley took his son with him to buy a gun, a Sig Sauer 9mm that prosecutors argued they intended for their son’s personal use, despite him being well under 18, the legal age for gun ownership in Michigan. One day before the shooting, Ethan was caught at school looking up bullets to use with the gun and was disciplined. Instead of expressing concern, his mother joked over text, “lol I’m.not mad. you have to learn not.to.get caught.” The morning the shooting occurred, Ethan accessed the gun and took it to school in his backpack. Later, a schoolteacher alerted authorities after he drew a collection of disturbing images on a math worksheet, including a gun very similar to the Sig Sauer his father had just bought. Next to the gun, he sketched a person who appeared to be riddled with bullet wounds. Below it, he wrote, “The thoughts won’t stop — help me,” along with other messages like “blood everywhere” and “my life is useless.” Despite these indicators, neither James nor Jennifer alerted the school to the fact they had just purchased a gun similar to the one shown in the drawing. They left him at the school and went back to their jobs, without returning home to make sure the gun was still secured. School administrators neglected to search Ethan’s backpack, where the gun was still hidden. A few hours after this meeting, the Crumbleys received reports of the school shooting and immediately began frantically messaging him. “He must be the shooter,” Crumbley texted her boss. By then, however, it was too late to intervene. The Crumbleys are the first parents to be held criminally responsible for their role in a child’s mass shooting Again, this is a precedent-setting case. Michigan prosecutor Karen McDonald told CBS News after James Crumbley’s trial in March that she hadn’t initially been thinking about what precedents did or didn’t exist, but that the facts of the case led her to the decision to prosecute. “The very first question I asked was, ‘Where did he get that gun, and how did he get it?’ And that question led to some really disturbing facts,” she said. “I think it’s a rare set of facts, but I also think that we don’t ask the question enough.” vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Subscribe The Crumbleys’ lawyers fought the case’s legality from the start — arguing there was no justification for bringing charges against parents for the actions of their son, and that the decision to press charges could lead to overzealous prosecution of gun owners in the future. But a state appellate court ruled that the trials could move forward, pointing out that Ethan Crumbley’s actions were “reasonably foreseeable.” Even as it did so, however, the court acknowledged it was an unusual case. Prosecutors argued that both parents failed to exercise “ reasonable care ” of their son, and went even further in failing to restrict his access to the gun. The Crumbleys have never admitted to buying the Sig Sauer for their son’s use, but in any case, they seemed to make only a token effort to secure the gun away from him. Gun safety experts recommend that considerable care be taken when storing a gun away from family members — in particular, making sure the gun and the bullets are kept locked and separate from each other. “Securing the gun is the whole thing,” James Crumbley’s anonymous jury foreman told the Detroit Free Press after his verdict in March. While the extraordinary circumstances of this case make it unlikely that every parent of a school shooter could face prosecution, the Michigan shooter shares plenty of common red flags with other school shooters that parents should be alert to. The Crumbleys have claimed ignorance, but they’ve also reportedly shown a lack of remorse, with James Crumbley claiming to be a “martyr” for the cause of gun rights. Jurors clearly disagreed. “It’s not gonna fix nothing,” James Crumbley’s jury foreman said after his verdict. “It’s just a start ... it’s a start of things.” This story appeared originally in Today, Explained , Vox’s flagship daily newsletter.

"2","Moyle v. United States should have been a very easy case. A federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), requires nearly all hospitals to provide “such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition” of “any individual” who arrives at the hospital’s ER with an “emergency medical condition.” Though the law does not specifically mention abortions, EMTALA is written in capacious terms — requiring covered hospitals to perform an emergency abortion when that is the appropriate treatment to resolve a patient’s medical emergency. And yet, last January, the Supreme Court effectively nullified EMTALA , at least for patients who require abortion . Moyle , which the Court will hear the last full week of April, asks whether this nullification should be made permanent. The case involves a conflict between the federal law and Idaho’s unusually restrictive anti- abortion statute, which permits physicians to perform an abortion when “ necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman ,” but not when a patient’s pregnancy only threatens to disable or seriously harm them. EMTALA, meanwhile, requires most hospitals to provide whatever care is necessary to stabilize a patient who is at risk of “serious impairment to bodily functions,” “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part,” or other nonfatal consequences that are defined as medical emergencies by EMTALA . So, for example, if a patient’s uterus could be destroyed, but she is likely to survive if untreated, EMTALA requires hospitals to perform an abortion if terminating the pregnancy would stabilize the patient’s medical condition. When federal law conflicts with a state’s law, the Constitution provides that the federal law “ shall be the supreme Law of the Land” — and thus the state law is “preempted.” EMTALA also contains a provision stating that state and local laws must give way “ to the extent that the [state law] directly conflicts with a requirement of this section .” So, again, Moyle should be an easy case, and a federal district court ruled in 2022 that Idaho’s abortion ban must give way to EMTALA when a pregnant patient has a medical emergency that must be treated with an abortion. Last January, however, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked this district court’s order, reinstating Idaho’s sweeping abortion ban while the justices ponder the Moyle case. That’s a strong sign that, despite EMTALA’s clear text, the justices could permanently neutralize the federal law’s protections for people who must have an abortion to avoid catastrophic medical consequences. (No justice publicly dissented from this temporary order, but justices sometimes disagree with the Court’s orders but do not note their dissent.) Moyle is a test of whether these justices will follow the text of a clearly drafted law EMTALA is a reasonably straightforward statute. It only applies to hospitals with emergency rooms, and only to those hospitals that accept Medicare funds. That’s most hospitals because Medicare provides health coverage to Americans over the age of 65. The primary purpose of this law is to ensure that hospitals provide emergency medical care to patients who may not be able to pay for it . But the law is also written in expansive terms. It states that “if any individual ... comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition,” the hospital typically must “stabilize the medical condition.” (In limited circumstances, the hospital may transfer the patient to another facility.) EMTALA also defines the term “emergency medical condition” to include not just life-threatening medical conditions , but also conditions that place a patient’s health in “serious jeopardy” or that threatens serious harm to a patient’s “bodily functions” or “any bodily organ or part.” Faced with this fairly explicit text, Idaho’s lawyers (and a separate team of lawyers representing the state’s GOP legislature ) offer several arguments to justify leaving its broad abortion ban in place. One of their main arguments is that EMTALA should be read only to prohibit “ turning away indigent patients with serious medical conditions .” The Justice Department agrees that preventing hospitals from turning away such patients was Congress’s prime motive when it enacted EMTALA in 1986. But the text of the statute does not support such a narrow reading of its effects. Both the state’s brief and the state legislature’s brief also lean heavily into a provision of federal Medicare law which provides that EMTALA should not be read “to authorize any Federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided.” They claim that this provision prevents EMTALA from being read to alter which medical procedures can legally be performed in Idaho. But this argument also conflicts with the text of federal law. Even if the Court agrees that requiring doctors to perform medically necessary abortions constitutes “supervision or control over the practice of medicine,” the statutory provision Idaho points to only prohibits “any Federal officer or employee” from exercising such supervision. No federal officer or employee — meaning, a member of the federal executive branch — has decreed that Idaho hospitals must provide emergency abortions. Rather, the Biden administration argues that Congress made this determination when it enacted EMTALA. The anti- abortion briefs also point to several provisions of the EMTALA statute which require hospitals to offer stabilizing care to a pregnant patient’s “unborn child” if a medical emergency endangers the fetus’s life. They claim that reading the federal law to require emergency abortions would “put it at war with” its provisions protecting fetal life. But this argument is also at odds with EMTALA’s text. The federal statute provides that a hospital meets its obligations under EMTALA if it “ offers ” a patient medically stabilizing treatment and “informs the individual (or a person acting on the individual’s behalf) of the risks and benefits” of that treatment. Thus, when a pregnant patient faces a medical emergency that endangers both the patient and their fetus, the hospital’s obligation is to offer treatment that will stabilize both patients. And, in the tragic case where a patient is forced to choose between an abortion, which would stabilize their own condition, or a treatment which would save the fetus but leave the mother at risk, EMTALA requires the hospital to offer both treatments, and inform the patient of the terrible choice they must make. And then the hospital must honor the patient’s choice, even if the state does not approve of it. Idaho also wants the Supreme Court to fundamentally alter the balance of power between Congress and the states Idaho’s two legal teams also make a pair of arguments that seek to weaken Congress in fundamental ways and to place novel new limits on the federal government’s ability to preempt state laws. The first of these arguments is that EMTALA — or, at least, the Biden administration’s textualist reading of EMTALA — violates something called the “major questions doctrine.” The major questions doctrine claims that Congress must “speak clearly” if it wishes to give a federal agency the power to decide a question of “vast ‘economic and political significance.’” This doctrine is not mentioned in the Constitution or in any federal law , and appears to have been made up entirely by Republican appointees to the Supreme Court. Even if you accept this made-up doctrine as legitimate, however, it is not at all clear why it is relevant to the Moyle case. By its own terms, the major questions doctrine only applies when a federal agency claims the authority to decide an important policy question. But no federal agency — meaning, an agency within the Executive Branch — has made any policymaking decision of any kind in Moyle . Rather, the question is whether a law enacted by Congress requires Idaho hospitals to perform emergency abortions. Idaho, in other words, is arguing that a made-up legal doctrine, which appears in no legal text and that was fabricated entirely by judges, should be read to limit Congress’s ability to decide important policy questions. If the Court agrees, that would be an extraordinary transfer of power from an elected Congress to an unelected judiciary. The state’s strongest legal argument, meanwhile, turns on the fact that EMTALA’s obligations only apply to hospitals that accept federal Medicare funds. The Supreme Court has long held that, when Congress spends money, it may impose conditions on the recipients of that money — including on state governments. So, for example, the Court held in South Dakota v. Dole (1987) that Congress may require states that accept federal highway funds to raise their drinking age to 21 (Congress thought that the roads would be safer if there were less underage drinking and driving). In Moyle, however, the question is whether private hospitals that accept Medicare funds must perform emergency abortions. Idaho claims that, because it has not weighed in on whether to accept that funding, it has not consented to having its own state law overridden by EMTALA. And it argues that such consent is necessary for a federal spending program to override a state law. Idaho actually does have some legal support for this argument. In Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman (1981), the Supreme Court said that a state’s decision to accept federal funds is “much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.” So that does suggest that a state need not comply with “federally imposed conditions” if it did not “agree to comply” with them. But the Justice Department also cites many Supreme Court cases holding that Congress preempted a state law when it enacted a federal spending program that does not provide grants to states. Thus, in Coventry Health Care v. Nevils (2017), the Court held that the federal government’s decision to offer its own employees health plans that violate Missouri law preempts that state law. And in Bennett v. Arkansas (1988), the Court held that federal Social Security law overrides an Arkansas law that allowed the state to seize an incarcerated person’s Social Security benefits. Indeed, as recently as last year, the Court held in Health and Hospital Corporation v. Talevski (2023) that private plaintiffs may sue to enforce provisions of federal Medicaid law that impose obligations on institutions that accept Medicaid funds. Talevski rested on the proposition that conditions attached to federal grant programs are “laws” just like any other federal law, and thus can be enforced using the same mechanism individuals would use to enforce a different law. So, while Pennhurst offers some legal support for Idaho’s claim that EMTALA cannot modify a state law without the state’s consent, there are myriad cases supporting the opposing proposition. A justice who is determined to deny emergency abortions to patients who need them could rely on Pennhurst to achieve that result, but such a decision risks undermining countless other acts of Congress that override state laws. The Court’s decision in Moyle is likely to determine whether some women live or die Theoretically, Idaho’s law permits abortions when necessary to save a patient’s life. Many other states with abortion bans have broader exemptions on the books, which theoretically permit an abortion when a patient faces serious health consequences that may not be life- threatening. In practice, however, women in many states with strict abortion bans have struggled to obtain lifesaving or otherwise medically necessary care . In one case, a Texas woman with a nonviable pregnancy was told she had to wait to receive an abortion even though her body was discharging blood clots and a strange-smelling yellow liquid , Her doctors eventually agreed to induce labor after her vagina started to emit a dark, foul-smelling fluid. This happened, moreover, despite the fact that Texas law permits abortions when a patient “has a life-threatening physical condition” or faces a “serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function” that relates to their pregnancy. Incidents like this are common because many state legal provisions permitting emergency abortions have never been interpreted by any court, or have been interpreted largely by Republican judges who are hostile to abortion. So hospital lawyers often cannot know in advance when their state’s courts will allow doctors to perform an abortion, and doctors who guess wrong risk very serious criminal charges. If the Supreme Court reads EMTALA to say what it actually says in Moyle , that would relieve some of this uncertainty. It would mean that doctors or patients who cannot obtain a state court order permitting an emergency abortion could also seek such an order from federal court. It would also mean that, over time, a body of case law would develop establishing when federal law entitles someone experiencing a medical emergency to an abortion. But all of that depends on whether these justices, a majority of whom voted to overrule Roe v. Wade , will set aside their personal opposition to abortion and read EMTALA to do what it actually says.

"2","House Speaker Mike Johnson could be facing the most perilous threat to his leadership yet as Congress once again debates Ukraine aid . Johnson recently made clear he wants to hold a vote on sending more funding to Ukraine after the House returns from recess on Tuesday. That stance has infuriated far-right members like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) , who has vocally opposed the provision of such funds. Greene’s dissent over Ukraine — along with far-right members’ dismay over bipartisan government funding deals — has prompted her to issue an open threat to Johnson’s job . “Mike Johnson is not working for Republicans, he’s not helping Republicans, he’s not even listening to Republicans. Mike Johnson is doing the Deep State’s dirty work,” Greene said in an X statement last week . “We need a new Speaker of the House!” Mike Johnson is not working for Republicans, he’s not helping Republicans, he’s not even listening to Republicans. Mike Johnson is doing the Deep State’s dirty work. We need a new Speaker of the House! Watch my full segment on Steve Bannon’s War Room. pic.twitter.com/q5ac2OfIGg — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (@RepMTG) April 2, 2024 For now, Greene’s threat is just talk. Although she has filed a resolution regarding Johnson’s removal, it isn’t an expedited measure , meaning it isn’t guaranteed an immediate floor vote just yet. Additionally, Democrats have signaled that they could well help Johnson if he supports Ukraine aid . Given the House GOP’s two-seat majority, any Democratic assistance would likely thwart an attempt at removal if enough members of both parties banded together to save Johnson. Still, the threat adds to the competing pressures Johnson is facing on Ukraine — and spotlights the deep fracturing of the Republican conference and the dysfunction that’s plagued their tenure in the majority. In practice, that’s meant they haven’t been able to get much done — even compared to prior Congresses with similar party breakdowns — leaving them with few achievements as they attempt to retain their hold on the House in November’s elections. And it’s also meant that Ukraine aid, support that could have a major impact on the country’s defenses against Russia , is far from guaranteed. The far right is furious about Ukraine aid In an interview with Fox News in early April , Johnson said that the House would “be moving [Ukraine aid] right after the district work period,” a two-week span that began on March 25. That statement spurred a renewed wave of anger from far-right members, who’ve called for these funds to be used domestically at the southern border instead. It’s a position that echoes isolationist stances held by former President Donald Trump , who’s similarly cautioned against more Ukraine funding given the national debt and an “America First” mentality. As of mid-January , the US has provided roughly $74 billion to Ukraine in security assistance, weapons, and humanitarian support. Greene’s latest warning to Johnson only reiterates these sentiments. The Republican members who are against Ukraine aid have also grown in number over the past few months: In May 2022 , 57 House Republicans voted against an aid package for Ukraine. In September 2023 , 117 did the same. “It’s absurd that overnighting more tax dollars to Ukraine is even a consideration. It should be totally off the table and replaced with a push for peace talks,” Rep. Eli Crane (R-AZ) told Fox News in April. To assuage some of these concerns, Johnson has said the Ukraine package that the House will consider contains “important innovations” that address conservatives’ concerns. These include providing some aid to Ukraine via a loan, which the country would pay back to the US. (It’s not clear whether this loan would include interest, with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) urging that such fees be waived.) That’s a measure that’s gained traction among Republicans because it means US funds would be returned as part of aid efforts. Johnson has also alluded to adding provisions from the REPO Act, which would allow the US government to transfer Russian assets it has seized to Ukraine for the country’s reconstruction. “If we can use the seized assets of Russian oligarchs to allow Ukrainians to fight them, it’s just pure poetry,” Johnson said in his Fox News interview. Johnson has yet to detail exactly what the House Ukraine package will contain, but has made clear that it will differ from the $95 billion aid package the Senate approved in February, which includes $60 billion for Ukraine as well as funds for Israel and Taiwan. Johnson has also said that the package must include US- Mexico border security provisions , an idea Democrats have chafed against. Despite these concessions, certain members on the right still aren’t pleased. “Funding Ukraine is probably one of the most egregious things that he can do,” Greene emphasized last week . Their views aren’t indicative of the entire conference, however. Multiple centrist Republican leaders have stressed the importance of backing Ukraine as Russia’s invasion continues into its third year. “I am hopeful that the speaker will put the bill on the floor … so that we can once and for all ensure that our allies have the aid and support that they need,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) said in a CNN interview . Conservative dysfunction has real consequences The conflict over Ukraine aid and threats about Johnson’s leadership are just the latest chapter in Republican drama this term. Internal clashes — like the one that cost Johnson’s predecessor his job — have impeded their ability to make progress on their priorities, and on Congress’s ability to govern. When they took power after the 2022 midterms , House Republicans had big plans on everything from bringing state-level battles over schools to the national stage to lowering the cost of prescription drugs. They made virtually no progress on any of those goals. And when it comes to must-pass legislation, far-right pushback on the debt ceiling, for example, pushed lawmakers down to the wire to get it done, rattling markets and leading to a downgrade of the country’s credit rating . In the case of Ukraine aid, Republican infighting has already delayed funds, a hold-up that’s contributed to supply shortages and potential losses on the battlefield. The delay and uncertainty about this aid is also making it tougher for the US to coordinate with its allies when it comes to a cohesive strategy to support Ukraine, writes Dan Baer , a senior vice president of policy research at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. If Congress is unable to provide more aid, that could have even more serious consequences for the war, emboldening Russia and hurting Ukraine’s ability to defend itself. According to Max Boot, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , Ukraine could face shortages of ammunition if US aid stalls, likely increasing the casualties it experiences. And in the long term, the absence of this aid could have a decisive impact on its ability to fend off Russia completely. “Make no mistake: without US aid, Ukraine is likely to lose the war,” Boot writes.

"2","Nearly a year since the conservative majority on the Supreme Court struck down the Biden administration’s sweeping attempt to forgive student loans , the White House is now announcing more specifics on its Plan B . This second attempt is less all-encompassing than the first, which would have forgiven up to $10,000 in debt for most borrowers, but it’s still pretty ambitious. Plan B invokes a different legal authority than the one used in 2022, builds off existing programs that haven’t faced the same kind of legal pushback, and is much more targeted, all in an attempt to avoid the fate that the first loan forgiveness plan faced at the Supreme Court. Still, the Biden administration is likely to face opposition from Republicans and conservative critics, who may try to use the federal court system again to derail the plan. It’s also unclear whether voters, especially younger ones, will give Biden credit for this attempt since it largely applies to borrowers who have had debt for a long time, like millennials and Gen Xers. Combined with other loan forgiveness plans implemented during President Joe Biden’s term, Plan B would, according to the White House, relieve debt for more than 30 million Americans. Under this new plan, more than 4 million Americans will have their entire debt canceled and 10 million more would see at least $5,000 of relief. Another 23 million would have their accrued interest, the additional debt that borrowers have been saddled with on top of the principal, wiped away. Any relief is likely at least a few months away. The plan announced Monday is the result of a regulatory process that started a month after the Supreme Court struck down the first plan and it still requires a public comment period before anything can go into effect — meaning that the earliest that debt relief would begin is likely this fall. Who would get student loan forgiveness under Biden’s plan? This plan would target five kinds of borrowers, and in most cases it would not require them to fill out an application; the Education Department would use data it has on hand to implement the forgiveness once the plans are finalized. People who now owe more money on their loans than they originally borrowed . These borrowers would have up to $20,000 of debt from interest erased, regardless of their income. They would still have to repay the original amount they owe. Individuals making less than $120,000 a year, or couples making less than $240,000, would qualify to have full forgiveness of their interest. People who have owed on loans for at least 20 years . If a borrower entered repayment for undergraduate debt 20 years ago or more, they would qualify for full forgiveness. If a borrower of graduate school debt entered repayment 25 years ago or more, they would also qualify. People who took out loans to enroll in “low-value” academic programs . These borrowers took out loans for institutions or programs that were deemed by the federal government to have low financial value. The White House defines this as programs or schools that “lost their eligibility to participate in the Federal student aid program” or were deemed to have cheated their students, or left graduates with loan payments on earnings after school that were not better than what someone with a high school diploma could earn. People who would qualify for a preexisting loan forgiveness program but aren’t enrolled in one right now . This option would automatically enroll borrowers who qualify for forgiveness through the revamped income-driven or public service forgiveness programs. People experiencing financial hardships . This option is a little vaguer, but it is meant to apply to borrowers for whom other forgiveness and repayment programs don’t apply. Hardships include medical debt, expensive child care , and those at risk of default. What makes this approach to student loans different is the focus on accrued interest, or what the White House and Department of Education call “runaway interest.” Like all loans, student loan debt consists of a principal (the amount originally borrowed) and interest. When the cost of interest is higher than the amount you’re making in payments, the interest gets added to the balance of the loan. Then you end up with the amount you owe over time, which can keep growing, even if you’re making regular payments. That additional interest is often added to the principal, making future interest charges even larger. The White House has already implemented changes to the way interest is capitalized — or added to the principal balance and generating even more interest — and this plan builds off those regulatory changes to forgive interest entirely. Biden and his administration are spending Monday touting this new plan in key cities, including in swing states. The president is in Madison, Wisconsin, while Vice President Kamala Harris is heading to Philadelphia, her husband is traveling to Phoenix, and Miguel Cardona, the secretary of education, is meeting with borrowers in New York City.

"1","WASHINGTON — “From day one, my administration has been committed to fixing the broken student loan system,” President Joe Biden said to begin a video about his latest attempt to buy the college-graduate vote. Whenever Biden calls something “broken,” reach for your wallet. According to the White House, Biden’s student-loan forgiveness package should result in 4 million Americans seeing their college debt wiped clean; more than 10 million enjoying a reduction of $5,000 in debt relief; and the elimination of accrued interest for 23 million additional borrowers. I said I wouldn’t back down from using every tool at our disposal to get student loan borrowers the relief they need. That’s why today we’re announcing new plans that, if implemented, would cancel student debt for millions more. pic.twitter.com/rNiCxzzlU3 — President Biden (@POTUS) April 8, 2024 Forget, just for the moment, the cost to taxpayers. What frosts me is the Left’s apparent belief that loans shouldn’t be treated like, well, loans — at least for folks who went to college. To liberals, it is just plain mean to argue that adults who benefit from higher education should pay off the loans they accepted with open eyes. They don’t seem to notice that college grads expect to make more money than most Americans, who never saw the inside of a college classroom. During President Barack Obama’s tenure, newspapers discovered people who had borrowed huge amounts of money to go to college; after they graduated, they had an ugly run-in with reality about the heft of their monthly payments. That was an especially painful revelation for those who enrolled in college only to drop out. Obama himself complained in 2012 that his wife, Michelle, a fellow Harvard Law School graduate, and he had not paid off their loans until eight years earlier. Well, that can happen when you choose the Ivy League. “Forgiving loans,” House Education and the Workforce Committee chair Virginia Foxx noted in a statement, is a “nonsensical term,” since the loans “don’t disappear but instead are forced upon taxpayers.” These forgiveness schemes send the message, Foxx added, that “loans will never have to be paid back.” The result is a vicious cycle of colleges raising prices and students borrowing more. When you add room and board, the cost of attending some name schools already is approaching $100,000 per year. One thing the Left doesn’t seem to appreciate is that higher education is a choice. Ergo, going to an expensive school isn’t something you should expect other people to bankroll. High school graduates are free to apply not only to pricey universities but also to more affordable institutions, including community colleges. And really, the quality of an education is a function not only of a school’s reputation but also of how much work students put into their studies and how well they challenge themselves. The other affront to Democrats’ sensibilities is the notion that some people should go to community college. According to the highly regarded NAEP test, just 37 percent of U.S. high school graduates were proficient at reading in 2019. I know the president wants to take on “income inequality,” but that’s not done with the wave of a wand when so many students graduate unprepared for college. As November approaches and young liberals have shown themselves unenthusiastic about the incumbent, Team Biden is spinning this scheme as a noble effort opposed by Republicans, who stopped Biden’s first effort to “forgive” student loans unilaterally by executive order. All I can say is: Go, GOP. The right should fight against welfare for the better educated. Contact Review-Journal Washington columnist Debra J. Saunders at dsaunders@reviewjournal.com .

"1","I was a freshman in college in the Boston area in the spring of 1970, and a solar eclipse was coming to Nantucket Island. A bunch of us guys piled into my friend George’s beat-up Plymouth convertible early in the morning to be first in the ferry line. Ha ha. Not a chance. We were stuck outside totality. But we had a shot — at the very point of the elbow of Cape Cod, at the beach near Chatham, it would be 99.99 percent total — so off we went to the beach. I had seen pictures of a solar eclipse first in a kids’ book on astronomy that I loved early in grade school. I was so disappointed that they were rare and small. I had to make do with lunar eclipses, which I thought were pretty cool. Now at last I was going to see the big time — a real solar eclipse was in reach. It was more than I had expected. It was more than just the sun going dark — it was the stars coming out. It was the sudden silence of the birds as gulls came wheeling in over the ocean with no sound. It was the cold wind that blew in with it. The dark was over quickly. It didn’t matter. In the past seven years, it got easier to see them. In 2017, it took me only a five-hour ride to see the eclipse. My wife and I pulled into a McDonald’s crammed with about 100 people. People were tenting in its parking lot as well. It was in southern Kentucky, a mile or two from the Tennessee border. Folks with no frills, lots of kids — it was a country get-together. When totality came in, everyone clapped and cheered. We drove away having felt among friends (and then it took about 10 hours to drive home to Ohio). Today, I could just go out on my front stoop. Almost three full minutes of totality — well, maybe two and half or so. Didn’t matter too much. Eclipse at 3:10 p.m. (Shmuel Klatzkin/The American Spectator) A friend stopped by for some eclipse shades; neighbors sat out in their lawn chairs. I snapped some pics, having gotten a filter for the purpose. Everybody all over the town today was excited in a calm kind of way. Lots of smiles, not party smiles, but a different sort. The local radio chat show was all about the eclipse — how the birds started to sing their morning song as the sun reappeared, and then, in response to a question, a farmer phoning in to say that the roosters crowed just like at dawn. What got to people? It was as if the darkness in the middle of the day brought light. Suddenly, this ordinary world was shown as a majestic and beautiful. There is more to it that a watchmaker’s mechanism, left to run by itself. Isaiah’s reflection seemed a lot closer to home: “ Lift your eyes up on high and see who created these!” We can’t afford to shut out the numinous, the awesome, to choose to give our attention only to the machines that clamor and insist they are all there is. As the astronomer Arthur Eddington once said in gentle irony, “Show me the square root of a sonnet.” We are in the midst of something far greater than ourselves. In the midst meaning that we are of it and within it, for all that we are unique and individual. That we are merely observers of this great reality is an indulgent fantasy masquerading as wisdom. We are, rather, participants, choosing to attend to it, and our attention shapes the world we live in, for better or worse. A little bit of darkness interrupted the day today, but it brought much to light. People are thinking and talking. In a grim year of war and belligerent politics, the eclipse seized our attention effortlessly. God is here too, even in the darkness. He beckons us through that darkness, to emerge from that darkness together into a new light."
"1","O n March 21, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a “ sweeping ” lawsuit accusing Apple, one of the Big Tech companies the Biden administration loves to hate, of engaging in business practices that violate the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act. Joined by the attorneys general of 16 states, the DOJ’s complaint alleges that Apple’s exclusionary tactics have allowed it to “monopoliz[e]” the U.S. market for smartphones or, keeping its legal options open, perhaps a submarket for “performance” (high-end) smartphones. According to the DOJ , Apple’s iPhone accounts for about 65 percent of the former market and 70 percent of the latter. Those market shares, however, may be larger among younger smartphone customers (Americans born after 1996). Put another way, 30 to 35 percent of the U.S. smartphone market, as the DOJ defines it, is served by Apple’s competitors, the two most “meaningful” being Google (parent Alphabet) and South Korea’s Samsung Group. Meaningful indeed. Apple is not a monopolist as economists understand that concept because it does not control anything close to 100 percent of the antitrust-relevant smartphone market. Apple may be big, and the iPhone may now dominate U.S. smartphone shipments, but large market shares today do not guarantee future market supremacy. Rewind the tape to May 18, 1998. On that date, the DOJ filed a complaint against Microsoft alleging that the company “possesses (and for several years has possessed) monopoly power in the market for personal computer operating systems.” At the time, Microsoft shipped roughly 90 percent of “Intel- compatible” computer operating systems. Sales of desktops running Apple’s MacOS were then so small that it was excluded from the DOJ’s market definition. United States v. Microsoft Corp. , one of the few legal precedents cited in the DOJ’s just-issued Apple filing, ultimately was decided in the government’s favor. One of the key issues raised at trial was that Microsoft’s monopoly was built in part on its inclusion of a web browser (Internet Explorer, or IE) in its Windows 95 operating system (OS) at no additional charge. Although supporters of the Microsoft case argued that competition would be restored only if the company was forced to separate IE from Windows 95, the presiding federal judge did not impose that remedy. Never mind! Internet Explorer has given way to Edge, released in 2010, and it too is bundled with Windows 11 OS. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s share of the U.S. desktop OS market has declined to about 60 percent ; the market share of Apple’s OS X (formerly Mac OS) has climbed to just under 28 percent; nerdy open-source Linux, ignored by the DOJ in 1998, nowadays represents about 2 percent of desktop computer operating systems. Microsoft’s “anticompetitive” bundling strategy evidently has not seriously undermined its rivals’ ability to enter the market for desktop operating systems and to expand their sales. That’s to be expected in marketplaces characterized by so-called network effects in which the value to consumers of joining a network goes up as the number of others connecting to the same network rises. In network industry after network industry (from telephones to video-recording and video-playback technologies to computer hardware and software), we observe what might be called not monopoly but “serial market dominance.” Because of product quality or functionality that was unknown previously or that consumers deem superior to available alternatives, one or a few sellers rise to a market’s commanding heights. But continuous innovation (Schumpeter’s “gale of creative destruction”) threatens such market dominance. The threats can arise beyond a market’s current boundaries or from the players on its “competitive fringe.” That fringe was tiny in 1998, composing just 10 percent of “Intel-compatible” computer operating systems. In 2024, Apple’s rivals account for 35 to 40 percent of the smartphone market, as the DOJ defines it. And those rivals, Google and Samsung, are no shrinking violets needing protection by the Justice Department’s antitrust lawyers, who apparently think they know better than smartphone buyers and sellers what the market should look like today and tomorrow. Antitrust law enforcement processes have morphed over the past few years into an ersatz industrial policy that pays lip service to consumers’ welfare but ignores consumers’ choices in favor of indulging the preferences of bureaucrats.

"1","Editor’s Note: When asked why, after thousands of years and millions of words, he felt that the world needed still another book arguing the case for God’s existence, Evan Sayet said: I wanted to write a book for the lay-reader and non-believer; a book that was not only factual and persuasive but fun to read. Most of the others are so darn earnest as they attempt to litigate the case. To me, attempting to litigate against atheism is like attempting to litigate against the emperor’s clothes; once you begin to discuss hemlines and stitch- counts, you’ve already given the emperor too much credibility. With atheism, there is simply no “there” there, and this needs to not so much be debated as pointed out, ridiculed and laughed at. Sayet, a longtime television writer ( Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher ) and popular political speaker, seems to have accomplished just what he set out to do. Jeremy Adams, the bestselling author of Hollowed Out: A Warning about America’s Next Generation and a recent California Teacher of the Year, concluded his review of Sayet’s new book, Magic Soup, Typing Monkeys, and Horny Aliens From Outer Space: The Patently Absurd, Wholly Unsubstantiated, and Extravagantly Failed Atheist Origin Myth , by saying: Believers often purchase C.S. Lewis’s Mere Christianity to help convince their unbelieving friends and family that there is an “unmoved mover” somewhere betwixt time and eternity. That book is a classic. So, too, is this one, or at least it deserves to be. Buy it for anyone searching for answers who also has a sense of humor. They might do more than laugh—they might just be saved. ***** Even if someday scientists were finally able to use their combined intelligence to create life from insentient materials, all that this will have then served to have proved is that life is even possible. But no one doubts that life is possible. We’re here. In fact, the only people who still wonder if life is possible are those Woke thirty-somethings who are still living in their parents’ basements. The question isn’t “can life exist” but rather “how did life first come to be?” and, after all of these years, the Materialists still don’t have even the very first clue. Do you know who else didn’t have even the very first clue? Whoever it was who came just before the world’s second caveman. Dawkins, the Oxford University professor, considered by many to be the single most effective spokesmodel for the Atheists’ various origin myths, was once asked for his expert understanding as to how life might have first come into being without God. Dawkins, who likes to be called an “evolutionary biologist” even though the chair for “propagandist” is in the history department, took a moment to compose himself and then, with that very same look of chagrin on his face that my friend Ed had had, he said that it was all just a “happy accident!” “Happy accident” is not a scientific theory. It’s how a fifty-year-old describes his newborn child through gritted teeth. In fact, not only is “happy accident” not a scientific theory; it is the very opposite of one. It is just yet one more way the professional Atheists have for saying “Duh, I dunno…shit happens.” We are now a full third of the way into the Big Questions upon which all of science itself is based, and while the Bible has given us the very laws and constants upon which all other science is contingent, the Atheists can still do nothing more than just point and grunt, albeit in Dawkins’ case, with a relatively charming British accent. It’s not as if the Atheists don’t have any other theories about the origin of life on earth besides “happy accident.” After ten thousand years, of course they do. They, in fact, have exactly one left that hasn’t yet been totally debunked by that which is already known. The Atheists call their last remaining viable theory “Directed Panspermia.” The concept behind the theory of “directed panspermia” is that a horny drag queen from outer space came to earth on a transit beam and then…oh, wait. I’m sorry. That’s The Rocky Horror Picture Show . In the Atheists’ theory, the horny space aliens came to earth on a rocketship . Seriously, this is the Atheists’ latest, best and, since “shit happens” isn’t actually a theory, only remaining theory as to how life might have begun on Earth without God. According to the Atheists, the horny space aliens then somehow impregnated the planet and, in doing so, became not only Earth’s baby-daddies but also the universe’s very first deadbeat dads. While the notion of horny aliens from outer space having had sex with the earth is just as absurd as is the “Flying Spaghetti Monster” that Dawkins has cynically compared to the God of the Bible, the difference is that while Jews and Christians don’t actually believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster, the world’s leading Atheistic “scientists” — including Dawkins — really do say that they believe in flying horndogs from outer space who then had sex with the earth. If you think I’m kidding, here’s Hargon’s comments on Overbye’s report: The most startling revelation in Overbye’s article is that scientists have resuscitated a proposal once floated by [Francis] Crick. Dissatisfied with conventional theories of life’s beginning, Crick conjectured that aliens came to Earth in a spaceship and planted the seeds of life here billions of years ago . Crick is no crank. He is, in fact, the legendary geneticist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for co-discovering the DNA’s double-helix design. Crick didn’t propose the Atheists’ Flying-Horndogs-from-Outer-Space-Having- Had-Sex-With-the-Earth theory because he’d just seen a starship racing away at warp speed when Earth’s husband returned home early from work, or because he’d suddenly discovered remnants of alien sperm on the arctic ice sheets. In fact, the only evidence that supports the Atheists’ theory of horny aliens from outer space having had sex with the earth is the fact that the aliens haven’t called once since. Crick didn’t propose FHFOS because there was any evidence for it; he proposed it wholly by default. Just as the Atheists’ totally made- up their alternative universes and additional dimensions only after having concluded that there is simply nothing in ours that could possibly provide the Materialists with an answer that would allow them to keep their prior political commitment, Crick understood that there is simply nothing on earth a Materialist can use to possibly even begin to explain how life might have first come from the lifeless without God. Once again — and as always — when you’re an Atheist, no evidence is always your best evidence, because all of the known evidence has fully debunked your every other effort. Crick, then, only did what all good scientists do; he simply proposed the next, least implausible theory that hasn’t yet been totally debunked by the known facts, which, at this point for the Atheists, is flying horndogs from outer space having had sex with the earth. That’s it. That’s all they have left. When Crick first proposed FHFOS in 1973 it was, of course, rejected out-of-hand by the scientific community as the wholly unsubstantiated, patent absurdity that it is. A full half-century later, though — with the quantum leap forward in technological capabilities having only further confirmed that no materialistic answer can possibly ever be found on earth without God — Crick’s theory of the Flying-Horndogs-from-Outer-Space-Having-Had-Sex-With-the-Earth is now the leading theory amongst Atheistic scientists. In fact, since “happy accident” isn’t actually a theory, FHFOS is the only remaining theory that the Atheists have left for how life might have begun on earth without God. Here’s how Dawkins explains the “scientific” method that the Atheists use to arrive at their theory about flying horndogs: Given the weaknesses of all theories of terrestrial genesis, Directed Panspermia should be considered a serious possibility. That’s it. That’s the entirety of the evidence for the Atheists’ only remaining theory as to how life might have begun on earth without God; all of their previous theories were even worse. Not only is Atheistic “science” a joke; it’s actually an old one: This guy was just such a miserable human being in every conceivable way that when he died no one could think of even a single kind word to say about him at his funeral. Finally, one of his neighbors made his way to the altar, cleared his throat and said: “His brother was even worse.” The entire “scientific” basis upon which the Atheists’ current, best and only remaining theory as to how life might have begun on earth without God is that all of their other theories are even worse. Even worse than horny space aliens having humped a flying rock? Just how bad must those other theories be? Well, we’ll soon find out. Meanwhile, with FHFOS having in no way advanced the scientific case for atheism, the Atheists have, once again, further made the case for God. Even when they’re just totally making up stories wholly unconstrained by the need for such pesky things as evidence and reason, the Atheists still can’t even conjure a tale that doesn’t require preexisting life (the aliens) with, in this case, the intelligence to have designed rocket ships capable of intergalactic travel. You’d think, being that advanced, they’d have also have invented the condom. Not to be missed, then, is that just as the Atheists have already conceded the most essential elements of the science of Intelligent Design with regard to the first of the Big Questions by admitting that the universe simply had to have been created by something or someone outside of our physical laws and/or perceivable dimensions, they have now conceded the most essential element of the second question as well. By their embrace of FHFOS, the Atheists have admitted that life could not have started on earth without a preexisting and intelligent lifeform from somewhere else. Once again, then, both sides are in total agreement about what it is that the known science shows and where it is that that science leads; the only difference is found in the fact that, while believers in the science of Intelligent Design and the revelations of the Bible are convinced that that preexisting intelligent life is from one of those universes and/or dimensions that the Atheists have already been forced to concede, the Atheists’ combined efforts, cutting edge technology and many and massive computers has led them to conclude that it must have been a couple of horny aliens, cruising the galaxies in their rocketship, until they took sexual advantage of a planet that they saw was looking a little blue.

"1","Last night, during the eclipse, I was having a few drinks. That’s not the news. The news is that I was having drinks with a retired paratrooper who put his life on the line during various special operations in the ’80s and ’90s, especially in the Yugoslav wars, stationed in Bosnia and Kosovo. He spoke to me with a mixture of envy and sadness as he compared the treatment given to veterans in the United States with that given in Spain. He told me that it was not just a question of economics, although that, too; it was also a question of social indifference toward past merits. He was engrossed in the recital of his stories of impossible jumps in the midst of savage combats, he became emotional upon recounting the death or mutilation of his entire unit, and he seemed genuinely happy to finally be able to tell someone about it. “Almost 20 years have gone by without anyone showing even the slightest interest in hearing these stories,” he confessed to me. One of the most interesting topics of conversation has to do with the precision of operations in a war. Surgical precision in operations and other exaggerations are something we journalists have made fashionable, and we are the only ones who are idiot enough to talk about a “surgical strike” when you are talking about launching missiles loaded with hundreds of kilos of explosives. The only thing surgical happening there comes after the explosion, in the nearest hospital. Obviously civilized countries try to minimize damage and stick to the target. But even though technology has advanced infinitely, comparing a Tomahawk to a scalpel is a sick joke that could only be invented by some idiot who has never set foot on a battlefield. We were talking about all this when I was reminded of what happened in Gaza a few days ago, when seven members of the NGO World Central Kitchen , who were delivering food, were killed when they were hit by a misdirected bombing from Israeli forces. This was a regrettable event, and Israel has responded by punishing five of its army commanders for the mistakes that led to the fatal outcome and has also ordered an internal investigation. It is always a tragedy when an aid worker or journalist dies in a war, but my friend is absolutely right: It is something that can happen. It’s a possibility. It sounds like a stupid comment, but it’s true. Sometimes we forget the bottom line: that when you’re somewhere that’s at war and bombs, explosions, and bullets graze your skin on a daily basis, the chances of you becoming a collateral victim are very high. This is the first generation in history to whom this needs to be explained. Be that as it may, what happened in Gaza has served to reactivate the usual anti-Semitism, and as an opportunity for the Western Left — there is no longer any distinction between countries here — to feel a little closer to Palestinian terrorism. And, of course, the first one who did not want to miss the party was Nancy Pelosi. It doesn’t matter what issue you’re facing. If you want to get it right, look at which side Nancy Pelosi has taken, and take the opposite one. Now 36 Democratic congressmen led by Pelosi have sent a letter to Joe Biden. They ask him to stop sending arms to Israel, after the “strike against aid workers.” In fact, they are misleading right from the very beginning of their letter. Israel did not organize any attack against aid workers. That is just a fantasy of the extreme left. Israel missed its target, and those who intervened in the operation grossly bypassed the usual protocols and behaved negligently and really stupidly; and for that they have been punished. You will never see a Hamas leader ask for an explanation from his terrorists for the murder, torture, or rape of Israeli civilians. It’s not that Pelosi and the 36 Democrats are outraged by the accident and have decided to reposition themselves now against Israel and in support of Palestinian terrorism. It’s just that they were dying to do it. Because the post-modern Western Left is far left, and this means they hate democracies and free nations (including their own) and sympathize with dictators and terrorists. Error is a possibility. The death of innocent people is terrible. But using a military accident for your political gain quite simply defines what kind of person you are. Or animal. Translated by Joel Dalmau.

"1","I f you hang around on Xwitter long enough, you’re going to run into some of the DNC’s paid trolls who vomit forth the usual propaganda about their candidate, the decrepit pervert Joe Biden who deserves blame for misgoverning a country three-quarters of us believe is on the wrong track. (Except that it isn’t really Biden doing the misgoverning, is it? He’s more like Ron Burgundy reading off a teleprompter than Lyndon Johnson directing bombing runs over North Vietnam.) Most of these people are right out of Central Casting. Oh, look — here’s the stylish Gen Z soy boy. Here’s the Navy vet granddad. Here’s the very bright, very enthusiastic Asian-American teenager. Here’s the angst- ridden 20-something obsessed with her right to off her offspring right up until the day the kid is born. And, magically, these uninteresting, bot-like “influencers” all happen to say the exact same things on the exact same days. But they’re all Totally Individual, You Guys. A recurring theme among these people — I’m being generous, mind you; maybe I give AI too much credit to think there’s a computer out there calling itself Harry Sisson and dumbing itself down to the level of that account’s tweets — is that Joe Biden is a decent man. He’s a decent man, all right. He supposedly takes very decent showers naked with his teenage daughter. And he very decently sniffs the hair of other people’s kids when they make the mistake of letting him get close enough. And the only thing more decent than the Chinese bribes he and his family have taken were the Ukrainian bribes. And the Romanian bribes were, of course, the very pillar of decency. Speaking of decent bribes, is it not strange that Biden Inc. couldn’t find any Americans to take bribes from? In any event, you do have to give the DNC trolls a little bit of your sympathy, because it’s hard to do this kind of work for Joe Biden. How do you tout this guy when he goes to Wisconsin and makes an abject fool out of you? I’m speaking about this, of course: Joe Biden just said in a speech in Wisconsin “I, like an awful lot of people in this audience, was the first in my family to go to college.” That is a lie. One of the reasons we know it’s a lie is because Biden has bragged several times in the past about how his grandfather… pic.twitter.com/1ppP90RDnD — Greg Price (@greg_price11) April 8, 2024 Joe Biden has told this lie about how he’s the first member of his family to go to college so many times and had it debunked so many times that it’s time to call the shrinks in. Of course, lying to the American people from the campaign trail is something Joe Biden has done perhaps more shamelessly than any politician in memory. It absolutely never ends with him. And it goes back four decades. For example, this was an all-time favorite: Every element of those claims was fraudulent, and Biden was eviscerated for them. That and when it became evident that his stump speech had been plagiarized from a leftist British politician named Neil Kinnock. (RELATED: Joe Biden Is Not Senile — He’s Stupid ) And part of Kinnock’s shtick was that … he was the first one in his family to attend college. Biden is a third-generation college man. He had a grandfather who went to Santa Clara College, as Biden claims, and may or may not have been an All-American football player. One of Biden’s lies about his own college background is that he played football at the University of Delaware when there is no record of his ever appearing in a game. And his father didn’t just go to college; he went to Johns Hopkins. Which is a lot more prestigious institution than either Delaware or Syracuse University, where Biden went to law school. You would think that continuing to make such a repeatedly debunked claim wouldn’t happen anymore. You’d think that he’d have learned to leave it alone. And yet Biden can’t. He can’t because he’s told so many lies, and he’s shown so much contempt for the voters he’s taken a podium to address for so long, that Joe Biden can’t differentiate between his lies and reality. His lies have become his reality. He believes his own bullshit now. And he’s so demented, so senile, that it’s all a cloud in his head that he can’t see through. So a claim he made when running a failed campaign for president in 1988 is just as true to him as something that actually happened. That’s why you have stories about Corn Pop, and that’s why he acts like it’s inconceivable he and his family might have done something wrong in taking all that money from those sketchy foreigners. In the cloud, it’s all true. Or none of it is. And so, he picks and chooses what he wants to believe on a given day. Reality? The world? Consequence? Those things have never mattered to Joe Biden. His is a song sung by a fool to an audience of idiots, and he’s never known any real trouble for singing it. Sure, he was disqualified as a presidential candidate multiple times for his lies and the grotesquely insignificant record of achievement they papered over. It didn’t matter. Barack Obama made him vice president and then president anyway. And those bribes, the classified documents he stole and squirreled away — or used for whatever sketchy purpose he might have intended — none of it ever mattered. It never mattered because Joe Biden is a decent man. Or, at least, so say the new generation of liars."
"1","Former President Donald Trump thinks he made the right political decision when he announced Monday that he will not back a nationwide ban on late-term abortions. He thinks this stance will make it easier for political independents to support him and that few conservatives will fail to vote for him because of it. But Trump did not make the right decision. This choice will instead come back to haunt him. It is true that, following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade , the anti-abortion position has played poorly at the ballot box, particularly when voters have been asked to address the issue head-on. While some conservative governors who imposed strong restrictions on abortion, such as Georgia’s Brian Kemp, have been reelected, other Republican politicians, such as candidates for the Virginia statehouse, have lost elections because of their positions on abortion. However, Trump’s response to this political dilemma for the Republican Party will not be a winner. This is because his stance amounts to retreat on an issue that has animated national American politics for the past five decades and galvanized conservative support at pivotal moments. In fact, abortion was the key reason Trump won the presidency in 2016. According to the Washington Post , 26 percent of Trump voters in 2016 said that his ability to nominate conservative Supreme Court justices — who would be opposed to Roe v. Wade — was the reason for their decision . Additionally, the issue of abortion motivated Republicans more than Democrats in 2016: According to a CNN exit poll , of those who said Supreme Court nominations were “the most important factor,” 56 percent voted for Trump while only 41 percent voted for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Of course, there is a difference between voting for a candidate who pledges to appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade and voting for one who pledges to ban late-term abortions nationwide. The motivation underlying both of those decisions, however, is opposition to the proliferation of abortion. And now that Roe is dead, the way for the Republican Party to take advantage of its side of the issue — the pro-life side — on the national level is to seek nationwide restrictions. If Republicans bow out on this most salient issue, they will hand all momentum on it to Democrats, who are pressing for full legalization. Now is the time to stand firm and keep rank so that this most contentious issue can be used as a wedge to drive conservative support in the long-term. It is not the time to back out on one of the foremost issues in America — if not the foremost — thus ceding all ground on it at the national level to Democrats. True, Trump can put forward plans to reduce access to abortion through alternative measures and claim that he would be better than Biden on the issue. But in taking the position that the states should decide, he has effectively removed himself from the debate and relinquished the leverage that the abortion issue would have provided him. Since he is not even willing to stop the abortions that are as vividly barbaric as those that kill children right before birth, he has removed himself from the debate. Trump’s political style has long been characterized by his strategy of taking strong stances on issues ahead of others and, in doing so, compelling voters to his side. This has been true on his protectionist trade policy, America First approach to foreign policy, staunch opposition to China, and advocacy for immigration security. Retreating and leaving Democrats to stand alone on a critical issue is contrary to his political tactics. It will make him into a weak politician when he wants to be perceived as a strong one. Trump’s decision to abandon the issue of abortion seems to be founded on bitterness and fear. As for the first, the Washington Post has reported that Trump feels pro-lifers have been ungrateful for the political victory he handed them through the appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. When conservative activists were pushing for him to adopt a national ban on abortion, Trump asked them “why they were not more thankful for what he had already done,” the Post reported . As for the latter motivation, fear, Trump seems to have succumbed to the mainstream media’s endless propagandizing of the idea that support for restrictions on abortion cannot possibly be a politically smart move to make. (READ ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE: Trump Made the Right Call ) Trump has abandoned the issue of abortion now that he believes its political expediency has passed. “You must follow your heart on this issue, but remember you must also win elections to restore our culture,” he said in his video on Truth Social announcing his position. This is simply wrong. If Trump wants to rally conservative support and passion — and turn the 2024 election into the moral mandate that was the 2016 election — he should demand nationwide restrictions on abortion. Driving a movement for the abolition of abortion, the evil that murders millions of Americans, would be much more powerful than tepid retreat."
"1","“W e are deeply disappointed in President Trump’s position,” Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, reacted to Donald Trump revealing his post- Dobbs , 2024 position on abortion. Trump, rather than pro-life activists, gets it right here. After foolishly floating a national ban on abortions that take place after the 15th week of pregnancy, Trump embraced the logic of the Dobbs decision: leave the question to the states where the Constitution dictates it belongs. (RELATED: Trump Weighs In on the Abortion Debate ) “My view is, now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” Trump reasoned on Truth Social. Dobbs , of course, was the great compromise on abortion. It did not do the opposite of Roe , meaning that it did not impose a uniform ban on abortions the way Roe uniformly banned states from banning it. Instead, it, in its middle (and constitutional) course, told Alabama to make laws for Alabama and not Massachusetts and Massachusetts to make laws for Massachusetts and not Alabama.

"1","It’s moments like these when Pope Francis’ pastoral attitude and openness to secular liberals is beneficial. On Monday, the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith released a major doctrinal declaration on human dignity. Titled Dignitas infinita , the document addresses numerous violations of human dignity, including abortion, violence against women, human trafficking, war, poverty, euthanasia, sexual abuse, and the marginalization of people with disabilities. The document has captivated the attention of Western media due to its statements on issues that have emerged as major controversies in the 21st century: surrogacy, “gender theory,” and “sex change.” The Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, which is headed by Cardinal Víctor Manuel “Tucho” Fernández, confronted these topics in accordance with the longstanding teachings of the Catholic Church — and with a forcefulness that is unusual for Francis’ papacy. “[A]ny sex-change intervention, as a rule, risks threatening the unique dignity the person has received from the moment of conception,” the document states. This declaration that so-called phalloplasties and vaginoplasties threaten a person’s “unique dignity” drew consternation from self-identified transgender activists and Western media outlets. Mara Klein, who identifies as both “nonbinary” and “transgender” and was a delegate to the Synodal Way in Germany, told the Associated Press that the Vatican’s statement on “sex-change intervention” was “dangerously ignorant.” She said, “The suggestion that gender-affirming health care — which has saved the lives of so many wonderful trans people and enabled them to live in harmony with their bodies, their communities and (God) — might risk or diminish trans people’s dignity is not only hurtful but dangerously ignorant.” Meanwhile, New Ways Ministry, a fringe American activist group that advocates for the Catholic Church to adopt progressive ideology, claimed that the document “fails terribly by offering transgender and nonbinary people not infinite, but limited human dignity.” In addition, the New York Times declared in the middle of its reporting on Dignitas infinita that the Vatican is engaged in a balancing act between respecting people’s dignity and proclaiming Catholic doctrine. The Vatican, it said, “took pains” in the document “to strike a balance between protecting personal human dignity and clearly stating church teaching.” This is a “tightrope” that Francis “has tried to walk” throughout his papacy, the newspaper claimed. Contrary to what these outlets have reported, the Vatican is not saying that undergoing a phalloplasty diminishes the infinite dignity that a person possess by means of his or her creation in the image and likeness of God. Rather, the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith is saying that a “sex-change intervention” creates undignified “life conditions” for a person and can diminish a person’s moral dignity, which occurs when a person “exercis[es]” his or her “freedom against the law of love revealed by the Gospel.” This argument follows from Dignitas infinita ’s elucidation of “a fourfold distinction of the concept of dignity.” In this understanding, human beings possess indelible “ontological dignity” simply by their existence and creation by God that “can never be annulled,” but a person’s “existential dignity,” “moral dignity,” and “social dignity” can be lessened. The document explains: “Every individual possesses an inalienable and intrinsic dignity from the beginning of his or her existence as an irrevocable gift. However, the choice to express that dignity and manifest it to the full or to obscure it depends on each person’s free and responsible decision.” Moreover, while a person’s ontological dignity cannot possibly be lessened, it is violated through so-called sex-change surgeries. The document explains the Church’s opposition to “sex-change interventions” by asserting that humans “are inseparably composed of both body and soul” and that the body “serves as the living context in which the interiority of the soul unfolds and manifests itself.” It then quotes Pope Francis’ earlier teaching that humans are to accept God’s creation as it was given to us. “[C]reation,” said Pope Francis, “is prior to us and must be received as a gift. At the same time, we are called to protect our humanity, and this means, in the first place, accepting it and respecting it as it was created.” ***** In spite of the vocal opposition to the Vatican’s denouncement of “gender-affirmation surgeries,” it is not being disregarded. This is partly because the Vatican under Francis has garnered greater attention from secular liberal elites due to the perception that the pope is seeking to liberalize the Church. For example, even the White House was asked to respond to the Vatican’s document. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to give Joe Biden’s assessment of the document but stated, “[T]he president will continue to be an advocate for the rights, safety and dignity of the LGBTQ+ community, including transgender people here in the U.S.” In addition, some outlets blasted out articles mischaracterizing the document as the Vatican’s decision on whether to permit sex-change surgeries — a confusion that partially stems from Pope Francis’ liberal image. For instance, the U.K.’s Independent headlined its article on the document : “The Vatican issues declaration on sex change operations after five years of deliberation.” Pope Francis’ outreach to people who identify as transgender helps to frame the document as an effort to safeguard human dignity rather than as an attack against them. “Francis has made it a hallmark of his papacy to meet with gay and transgender Catholics,” noted the New York Times in its coverage of the document, while CNN’s Vatican correspondent said, “We should also state that Pope Francis has shown a pastoral welcome to those who are transgender Catholics, to the LGBTQ community more broadly.” Additionally, the pope’s strong opposition to laws that criminalize homosexuality as well as his advocacy for nondiscrimination against people who identify with the LGBTQ community, both of which are reiterated in Dignitas infinita , ease how the document is perceived by LGBTQ activists. For example, Father James Martin’s only response to the document was to state that he was “grateful that the Vatican has reiterated its official condemnation of every kind of violence against LGBTQ people.” In this way, Dignitas infinita represents Pope Francis’ effort to leverage his status as a liberalizing, pastoral pope to proclaim the Church’s message on crucial yet contentious topics. It is Pope Francis at his best. While some, such as the Washington Post , have interpreted Dignitas infinita as an “olive branch” to conservatives following a series of progressive declarations, notably including the statement on same-sex blessings , a more charitable and perhaps more accurate reading is that the pope independently wishes to denounce these controversial modern evils. The fact that Dignitas infinita has been in development for five years, and Pope Francis has long forcefully condemned issues like gender ideology and surrogacy, serves to support this interpretation. Still, it is likely that the document was strategically timed for this moment when outreach to conservatives is critical. ***** If this is the moment when Pope Francis is cashing in on his good will with secular liberals to denounce modern evils, he is not holding anything back. Pope Francis’ Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith says on surrogacy that every child “has the right to have a fully human (and not artificially induced) origin” and that surrogacy is “a grave violation of the dignity of the woman and the child.” On euthanasia, the Vatican department states that “there are no circumstances under which human life would cease from being dignified and could, as a result, be put to an end.” On abortion, it quotes Pope John Paul II’s declaration that “procured abortion is the deliberate and direct killing, by whatever means it is carried out, of a human being.” On gender theory, the document says that it “intends to deny the greatest possible difference that exists between living beings: sexual difference,” which it describes as “not only the greatest imaginable difference but … also the most beautiful and most powerful.” At a time when “surrogacy” is increasing rapidly, the legalization of euthanasia is proliferating, abortion is increasingly accepted around the world, and radical gender ideology is sweeping cultures, a strong and definitive disavowal by the Vatican was sorely needed. Credit goes to Pope Francis for bringing it about."

"2","Are young voters abandoning Joe Biden ? And, if so, are they flocking to Donald Trump ? Just about every national poll seems to show that Biden is underperforming with young people compared to his 2020 results as well as polls at the same point in the 2020 cycle. But the crosstab results of some of these surveys also suggest that Biden is not only losing ground; Trump is gaining support. That’s an especially surprising result for the famously progressive and Democratic-leaning youth vote. What gives? The debate can be broken down roughly into two camps. There are those who believe Trump and Republicans are gaining with this group, telling you to trust the data. There are just too many polls and surveys, they say, reporting favorable conditions for Republicans and for Trump to not believe that young voters are swinging his way. Polling aggregates show Republicans making gains with younger voters, they point out. The skeptical side is splintered. There are those who say the pro-Trump shift exists but is being overstated, noting polls specifically of younger voters still show a Biden edge — albeit a diminished one. There are others who question the validity of the polling, saying wild swings between surveys suggest there may be methodological problems. And others say third- party support shows Biden has room to win back voters in a way that Trump doesn’t. The reality is still a warning sign for Biden and Democrats. Something is happening to their support from the youngest voters, and they’ll need to win back these folks or make up any deficit with support from other voters. Let’s dive in. The case that there’s a real pro-Trump youth shift happening Look at what the polling aggregates tell us. Instead of looking at any single poll, take their sum view, conveniently updated every month in this cross-tabulation tracker from the former Democratic pollster Adam Carlson. Regardless of whether you look at the 18–34 or 18–29 subgroups that are often used in polling young voters, it’s clear that Biden is underperforming his 2020 numbers . In March 2024 polls alone, that shift from 2020 for those adults aged 18–29 was about 13 points toward Trump, even though Biden still holds an overall advantage of 11 points in the aggregate. Among adults aged 18–34, Trump holds a slight lead of about 1.5 percentage points. And this has generally been consistent when looking at the aggregate results of January and February 2024 polls as well. Trump is also viewed more favorably among young voters. Another consistent picture has emerged over the last few years: Trump’s favorability rating among the youngest cohort of voters has been steadily increasing. As of the end of 2023, that improvement has brought his standing with adults aged 18–34 back from a post-January 6 low point right to the same support he had on the eve of the 2020 election , according to Gallup polling. Other polls, like the Economist/YouGov’s surveys , found that by February 2024, Trump’s favorability among those under the age of 30 had finally turned positive, improving about 30 points since February 2021. Are there issues that are motivating this? Looking under the hood at what might be motivating a pro-Trump youth shift also reveals that Trump might be getting support from younger voters who trust him on specific issues. The Harvard Youth Poll in December, for example, showed Trump had an edge over Biden on a range of key issues with younger voters. On the economy , Trump had a 15-point lead; on national security , he had a 9-point lead; on the Gaza war, Trump led by 5 points; and on “strengthening the working class,” Trump had a 4-point advantage. Biden, meanwhile, had an edge on climate change , abortion , education, and “protecting democracy,” among a few other issues. It might not be isolated to Trump. Republicans have also seen gains in voter registration numbers with younger voters, most recently in North Carolina, as well as in swing states like Nevada and Pennsylvania, per tracking from the analyst Michael Pruser . In North Carolina, for example, younger voters are currently a larger share of all new registrants than at this point in the last two electoral cycles — but Democrats have lost a net 40,000 registrants in that time, while new young Republican registrants outnumbered new young Democratic registrants. So while both parties are gaining new voters, the Democratic advantage with this age cohort is narrowing quickly. The case that Republican youth support is overhyped or nonexistent Skepticism is healthy. Polls this far out, this side of the argument says, are unlikely to fully and accurately capture what is happening with demographic groups that are harder to reach and less engaged and aware of politics. This caveat applies both to polls taken before and during the primary — when plenty of voters aren’t even sure that the two choices they are being presented with will end up being the eventual nominees — and for polls of young voters specifically, who are notoriously uninformed about or disengaged with national electoral politics. Trump’s support may be overstated; just look at third-party support and his favorability. Polls specifically of young voters, like the Harvard Youth Poll, continue to show a large Biden advantage with younger voters (it was 11 points in December). They show that among the youth most likely to vote, Biden has an even bigger advantage (24 points). But they also show the threat of third- party candidates, which may be artificially dragging down Biden’s support. Adding those independent candidates, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., brings down Biden’s support tremendously in both the Harvard poll and in the election tracking site Split Ticket’s recent poll of young voters. Biden has an edge with them over both Trump and RFK, and that lead grows when looking at those most likely to vote. But RFK is still pulling a “non-trivial” amount of support from young Democrats and independents, groups that went for Biden in 2020, in both the Harvard Youth Poll and the Split Ticket poll. Complicating the picture for Republicans and Trump is the problem of favorability. Yes, Trump has recovered from his low point in 2021, but he consistently hits a roof of support in Split Ticket’s polling. Though both Biden and Trump are viewed unfavorably (65 percent for Biden, 70 percent for Trump), those who hold a “strongly unfavorable” view of Trump drastically outnumber the same category for Biden: 61 percent of young voters view Trump very negatively compared to just 44 percent who feel like that about Biden. “If young voters are defecting from Joe Biden, they’re not doing so out of any affinity for Donald Trump,” write the Split Ticket authors. So instead of a Trump youth rise, we’re seeing a collapse of youth support for Biden. We’re forgetting who we’re talking about. Younger voters tend to be more progressive and align with Democratic positions on a range of social and economic issues; they’ve voted for Democrats by overwhelming numbers; and they’re continuing to support Democratic positions in a variety of elections during midterms, off-year races, and special elections. Younger voters are especially likely to register or identify with neither political party, opting to be independents or unaffiliated voters when they register to vote, helping to explain why in some states, like North Carolina, Nevada, and Colorado (per Pruser’s analysis), unaffiliated registrants are outpacing Democratic and Republican registrants. With this context, it does seem hard to believe that we’re heading toward a generational realignment. Is it just too early? The answers here aren’t easy, most notably because polling seems to be extra noisy and sending conflicting messages. Even this month, the results of two high-quality national polls, one from Quinnipiac University and another released by Fox News , showed conflicting realities. In Quinnipiac’s survey, the results for young adults aged 18–34 gave Biden a 20-point advantage over Trump. Meanwhile, Fox’s survey showed that adults aged 18–29 backed Trump with an 18-point margin. This 38-point gap seems illogical, even if there are some discrepancies with the cohorts used in the surveys. And that leads us to a methodological question hanging over all of this. The way pollsters conduct their operations , as we have detailed before , has been evolving to address difficulty with telephone polling and non-response bias (when the results of a poll are affected by the unwillingness or absence of a specific kind of voter). In 2016 and 2020, for example, this non-response bias affected how pollsters were able to measure Trump’s support and therefore underestimated it. 2024 could very well be the reverse, but it’s much too early right now. The answers will reveal themselves after Election Day. One thing, though, feels certain: If the polls are right, Democrats have a problem with young voters. They have time to fix that, but they have a major problem if they can’t. Will you support Vox today? We believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.

"2","If the United States had a public transit problem, Washington’s Metro was a good case in point. In the years leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic , DC’s transit system — widely considered to be one of the best in the nation — found itself plagued by frequent delays, safety concerns , and falling ridership . Other US cities were struggling, too. America’s public transit agencies often fall victim to a vicious cycle that looks something like this: Politicians slash budgets, agencies cut their services, riders look for alternative ways to get around town, and fare revenues take a hit — eventually leading to even more cuts, fewer riders, and so on. Over the last couple of years, despite being bogged down by some safety issues , DC has tried to break out of that cycle. Flush with cash from federal pandemic aid, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA) doubled down on an “if you build it, they will come” strategy. It improved bus and train services and, in some cases, made fares more affordable in order to lure riders back. While other transit agencies took similar approaches — including reduced fares for riders or handing out signing bonuses to hire more workers — many still imposed service cuts rather than expansions . WMATA’s strategy has been successful so far: In February, ridership across the system was at 83 percent of pre- pandemic levels, and DC has now seen a faster transit recovery than any other major metro area with a comparable public transportation network. “It’s a risky approach, because it means they’ve spent more money more quickly,” said Yonah Freemark , a researcher at the Urban Institute who often focuses on transportation policy. “At the same time, the process has paid dividends.” For transit agencies like DC’s Metro, Covid relief funds created a new paradigm Fares alone never cut it. In 2019, for example, fare revenue covered less than a quarter of the operating costs of the country’s 100 largest transit agencies — nowhere near enough to keep the trains running. And that was before the pandemic. “Transit is not a money-making endeavor,” said Jarred Johnson , executive director of TransitMatters, a public transportation advocacy group in Massachusetts. “There’s really very, very few places in the world where transit makes money, and where it does, driving is extraordinarily expensive.” That’s why federal Covid relief money was so transformational for agencies like WMATA. It freed them from worrying about revenue — at least in the short term — and gave them the ability to focus on providing a good and affordable service. Had there been no federal aid, DC’s transit agency wouldn’t have been able to invest in hiring staff, improving train and bus frequency, or reducing costs for riders. And ridership would likely be nowhere near where it is today. Despite this obvious lesson, transportation agencies across the country will still have to overcome a deep-rooted culture in government that deprioritizes transit, dating back to Ronald Reagan and his crusade against welfare and public services. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter proposed a $50 billion spending plan to “reclaim and revitalize America’s transit systems.” But “that initiative fell apart during the Reagan years due to austerity politics,” Freemark said. The Reagan administration swiftly abandoned Carter’s idea and cut transit funding by over 30 percent. During those years, the idea of meaningfully subsidizing public transit was under attack. David Stockman, Reagan’s first director of the Office of Management and Budget, for example, considered subsidies for transit agencies’ operating costs a “special abomination.” Since then, the federal government has largely steered clear of subsidizing operating costs of public transit, particularly in large urban areas, and has focused its money mostly on capital improvement projects. So instead of cobbling together funds for necessities like hiring more bus drivers to provide more frequent service, cities end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars on splashy projects like an isolated streetcar line that comparatively serves very few people. Covid funds changed all of that. Through the various relief packages, the federal government injected $14 billion into transit agencies to make up for lost revenue and pay for day-to-day operations. Agencies like WMATA showed Americans just how much federal subsidies can achieve when they are directed toward operational costs: In 2023, Metro announced that it would run more train service than at any point in its history. Transit shouldn’t just prioritize 9-to-5 commuters One of President Joe Biden’s successes has been getting the federal government to invest in America’s infrastructure. The Federal Transit Administration, for example, says the bipartisan infrastructure law is the “largest federal investment in public transportation in the nation’s history.” Still, throwing more money at America’s public transit problem alone isn’t going to fix it. Transit agencies and elected officials also have to embrace a different culture around public transit and reimagine the purpose it serves. Historically, transit networks have been designed around a 9-to-5 work schedule, shuttling people from residential areas into downtowns and back. With remote work sticking around, it’s unlikely that 9-to-5 commuters will fully return to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon. If transit agencies hope to bring in new riders, they have to start catering more deliberately to nonwork commuters. “We have to move away from transit serving work trips,” Johnson said. “Transit needs to be useful for doctor’s visits, for going to see friends and family, for going to a play.” In order to get there, Johnson says transit agencies have to provide better schedules throughout the day, not just during rush hours, and to rethink when they schedule repair work. It also means getting creative with pricing. WMATA reduced fares on weekends , added more service during off-peak hours, and discounted passes for seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income riders. According to the Brookings Institution, off-peak and weekend ridership in Washington, DC, has seen a better recovery than rush-hour transit commutes. Weekend ridership has also surpassed pre-pandemic levels by 17 percent on Saturdays and 28 percent on Sundays, according to Metro . Changing the culture around using public transportation, however, can’t fall on transit agencies alone. One of the biggest impediments to maximizing service is that most systems still mostly revolve around office buildings that have only become more vacant since Covid. “The problem with the US that we face is that our downtowns have historically been, and most cities continue to be, quite monofunctional in form,” Freemark said. American downtowns are “almost entirely devoted to office uses.” One fix would be for cities to redevelop their downtowns to be more residential. And while that’s not necessarily an easy — or inexpensive — task, it’s a critical step toward encouraging people to be less reliant on cars. Some cities, including DC , are trying to do just that. Earlier this year, for example, Boston announced that it would offer tax credits to developers seeking to convert empty offices into housing. Governments should recognize that public service isn’t a business The federal government has long imposed unrealistic standards for agencies to operate like businesses. But transit is a public service and ought to be treated as such. That means accepting that it will require investing a lot more taxpayer money — from both the federal and state governments — to make it run efficiently and serve people well. As Randy Clarke, WMATA’s general manager, put it in an interview with NBC4 Washington last year: “We are a public service, right? So whether it’s people five days a week, three days a week, every day of the week, it doesn’t matter. We have to value public transit and fund it accordingly, or have a diminished system, and then we have to be honest: We’re gonna have impacts to our economy ; we’re gonna have impacts to equity; impacts to the climate.” In December, WMATA was projecting a $750 million deficit by 2025. The agency warned that if that gap wasn’t closed, the proposed service cuts would be catastrophic: Metro said it would have to lay off over 2,000 workers, eliminate almost half of the system’s bus lines, close down entire Metro stations, and increase wait times — all while hiking fares by as much as 20 percent. Clarke oversaw the Covid- era investments in DC’s transit and capitalized on the popularity of the system’s improved service to pressure the region’s jurisdictions to invest more money in Metro . The months that followed showed that Clarke had made a successful gamble: Not only did liberally spending pandemic aid help build a service that people wanted to ride, but by the time the cash started running out, WMATA had made subsidizing transit a more popular idea. Since the agency warned of its proposed service cuts, the jurisdictions it serves started coughing up cash. The District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia have proposed committing a total of $480 million toward closing the projected budget deficit. “The approach to spending money on improving service is really about creating public support for the transit network, and political support, ultimately,” Freemark said. Ultimately, WMATA made a bet based on a simple premise: Give people a public good they like, and politicians will have a hard time taking it away . And it seems to be working — at least for now.

"2","A few weeks ago, a TikTok user named Blaisey Arnold posted a video about her Chevy Tahoe. “After three years with my Tahoe, I’m finally getting rid of it,” Arnold said . It was her dream car, and she’d taken out a loan for the $84,000 — yes, you read that right , $84,000 — vehicle. Since then, she’d been paying $1,400 a month for the last three years, totaling about $50,000. But because of her high interest rate, only $10,000 of that money went toward paying off the balance of the car. “Honestly, that blows my mind,” she said. It blew her viewers’ minds, too. “The math isn’t mathing,” one commenter wrote. “Seriously, what is your interest rate???????” asked another. The video currently has about 2.5 million views. The situation was so untenable that Arnold joked in a follow-up video that she was considering leaving the Tahoe in a “bad part of town,” hiring the mob, or (more seriously) defaulting and letting it get repossessed. There’s a lot we can’t know about her situation, without looking at her finances and the terms of her loans. But she’s not the only one shelling out huge amounts of cash for a fancy car: Other women have also been sharing the details of their major monthly car payments on TikTok . Still, the online reactions seem to unite around a central theme: Arnold messed up big time by taking out a loans at a terrible rate. Defaulting and letting her car get repossessed, as she seems to be considering, will wreak havoc on her credit. You could argue that Arnold’s decisions were irresponsible (and I really don’t recommend paying what amounts to a mortgage on a car) but it’s worth looking beyond this one wacky example at the larger structural forces that make car ownership such a necessary burden – and, at times, such an unnecessary scam. Car ownership has gotten very expensive — but opting out can be difficult In a society built almost entirely around the supremacy of cars as a means of transportation , most working-age adults seem to consider owning one necessary. According to the 2021 Census, nearly 92 percent of American households had at least one vehicle, and the benefits of owning a car in a landscape built for them are so great that research suggests people will go out of their way to get one even if they can’t really afford it. vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page . Subscribe In the last few years, the costs around car ownership have soared , placing tremendous burdens on working class families and the poor. The pandemic disrupted supply chains , manufacturers turned their attention toward expensive luxury vehicles , and interest rates soared . New cars are now unaffordable for more than 80 percent of Americans . Used car prices are up 34 percent from early 2020, too. On top of that, auto insurance rates have reached mind-boggling heights . Owning a car is also much more than just a practical necessity: For a lot of people, it’s an outward symbol of prosperity, freedom, and even political ideology . Car buyers are really vulnerable to exploitation — especially if they’re low-income Cars are really expensive in America right now. But some car payments are astronomically — indeed, exploitatively — high. To give one example: In their 2023 book, Cars and Jails: Freedom Dreams, Debt and Carcerality , authors Julie Livingston and Andrew Ross spoke with men recently released from prison who found that their credit histories prevented them from getting reasonable loans at affordable interest rates. Classic cars during a parade in San Francisco. Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images “A lot of people we were interviewing were driving pretty fancy cars. We were stroking our chins, going: ‘How did you afford that?’ It turned out that some of them were walking into dealerships and being told they couldn’t get financing for the Hondas they wanted, but could for a top-of-the-line Mercedes,” Ross told Vox last year. “Why would a lender and dealer do that? Because they know they’re going to be able to repossess the car quickly.” It’s not just formerly incarcerated people who are vulnerable. A 2021 Consumer Reports investigation found that the lack of a federal interest rate limit, combined with a complicated patchwork of state laws, leaves consumers vulnerable to being preyed upon by shady lenders. The investigation begins with an anecdote about a man who received disability payments from the Social Security Administration; he received a loan for a Jaguar with an astonishing annual percentage rate of 75 percent. “I don’t know APRs, I don’t know nothing about that,” the man told Consumer Reports. “I’m just trying to go in there and get the car.” In another piece, the publication found that lenders and dealers often lent money to people with poor credit, sometimes at higher rates, with the aim of collecting the high interest and repossessing the vehicles when people defaulted on their loans. There is some hope that things will get better. A few states have started to address the problem of hidden fees and predatory loans. At the end of 2023, the Federal Trade Commission announced a new rule aimed at cracking down on a slew of deceptive auto lending and sales practices. (It takes effect at the end of July 2024.) Meanwhile, auto debt reached a record-high $1.61 trillion last year, and that debt is, of course, most onerous for the people who can least afford to pay. Understanding how auto loans work — as Blaisey Arnold’s critics point out — is necessary, but it’s insufficient. Going after the lenders who prey on people who need cars to survive, and who often don’t realize they’re getting a bad deal, is paramount.

"2","The idea that language is a clumsy, imperfect tool for capturing the depth and richness of our experiences is ancient . For centuries, a steady stream of poets, philosophers, and spiritual practitioners have pointed to this indescribability, the difficult fact that our experiences are ineffable, or larger than what words can communicate. But as a frenzy of developments across AI , neuroscience , animal studies , psychedelics , and meditation breathe new life into consciousness research, scientists are devising new ways of, maybe, pushing our descriptions of experience beyond the limits of language. Part of the hope behind what mathematician and physicist Johannes Kleiner recently termed the “structural turn in consciousness science” is that where words fall short, math may prevail. “My view is that mathematical language is a way for us to climb out of the boundaries that evolution has set for our cognitive systems,” Kleiner told Vox. “Hopefully, [mathematical] structure is like a little hack to get around some of the private nature of consciousness.” For example, words could offer you a poem about the feeling of standing on a sidewalk when a car driving by splashes a puddle from last night’s rain directly into your face. A mathematical structure, on the other hand, could create an interactive 3D model of that experience, showing how all the different sensations — the smell of wet concrete, the maddening sound of the car fleeing the scene of its crime, the viscous drip of dirty water down your face — relate to one another. Structural approaches could provide new and more testable predictions about consciousness. That, in turn, could make a whole new range of experimental questions about consciousness tractable, like predicting the level of consciousness in coma patients , which structural ideas like Integrated Information Theory (IIT) are already doing. But for my money, there will always be a gap between even the best structural models of consciousness and the what-it’s-like-ness of the experiences we have. Mica Xu Ji, a former post-doctoral fellow at the Mila AI Institute and lead author of a new paper that takes a structural approach to making sense of this longstanding fact of ineffability, thinks ineffability isn’t a bug, it’s a feature that evolution baked into consciousness. From humans to machine learning models, information loss is a common problem. But another way to look at losing information is to see it as gaining simplicity, and simplicity, she explained, helps to make consciousness generalizable and more useful for navigating situations we haven’t experienced before. So maybe ineffability isn’t just a problem that locks away the full feeling of our experiences, but is also an evolutionary feature that helped us survive through the ages. The math of ineffability In theory, working out the precise ineffability of an experience is pretty straightforward. Ji and her colleagues began with the idea that the richness of conscious experience depends on the amount of information it contains. We can already take real-world reads of richness by measuring the entropy , or unpredictability, of electrical activity in the brain. Her paper argues that to gauge ineffability, all you’d need are two variables: the original state and the output state. The original state could be a direct measure of brain activity, including all the neural processing that goes on beneath conscious awareness. The output state could be the words you produce to describe it, or even the narrativized thoughts in your head about it (unless you have no inner monologue ). Then, comparing those numbers would give you an approximation of the ineffability. The more information lost in the conversion of experience to language, as measured by comparing the relative entropy of the original and output variables, the greater the magnitude of the ineffable, or the information that language left behind. “Ineffability is about how information gets lost as stuff goes downstream in brain processing,” said Kleiner. Now, think of the long arc of human evolution. Ineffability means that consciousness can produce simpler representations of the overwhelming richness of pure experience, what the American philosopher William James famously called the “blooming, buzzing confusion” of consciousness. That means encountering a pissed-off tiger can be generalized to the broader idea that all large cats with massive teeth may pose a threat, rather than constraining that lesson to only that specific tiger in that specific context. In machine learning models, as in humans, simplicity supports generalization, which makes the models useful beyond what they encounter in their training data sets. “Language has been optimized to be simple so that we can transmit information fast,” Ji said. “Ineffability, or information loss, is a fundamental feature of learning systems that generalize.” Pain, health, and the mundane potential of cracking ineffability Ineffability is often associated with mysticism , poetry , or heady conversations about the nature of the mind. Or now, the math of information theory and the evolutionary purpose of consciousness. But ineffability also plays a role in more immediate and mundane concerns. Take chronic pain. One of the most common approaches to understanding what someone with chronic pain is experiencing is to have them self-report the intensity of their pain on a scale from 0 to 10. Another, the Visual Analog Scale , asks them to mark their pain intensity along a 10-centimeter line, zero being no pain and 10 representing the worst possible pain. These are ... not the most detailed of measures. They also smuggle in assumptions that can distort how we understand the pain of others. For example, a linear scale with equal spaces between each possible number suggests that alleviating someone’s reported pain from a four to a three is roughly similar to dropping someone else’s from a nine to an eight. But the experiential distance between an eight and a nine could be orders of magnitude greater than between smaller numbers on the scale, leading us to drastically underestimate how much suffering people at the high end of the spectrum are enduring. Kleiner explained that structural approaches to representing pain can have the same effect as moving from a 2D image to 3D. “Structural research can distinguish not only location, but different qualities of the pain. Like whether it’s throbbing, for example. We could easily have 20 dimensions.” And each dimension adds more richness to our understanding of the pain. That could lend motivation — and funding — to treating some of the world’s most debilitating conditions that lack effective treatments, such as cluster headaches . The same principle applies to mental health . Many mental health indicators rely on self-reporting the richness of our internal experience on linear scales. But if structural approaches to consciousness can render 3D representations of experience, maybe they can add some richness to how we measure, and therefore manage, mental health at large. For example, neuroscientist Selen Atasoy has been developing the idea of “ brain harmonics ,” which measures electrical activity in the brain and delivers actual 3D representations of moments of experience. With those representations, it’s possible that we could learn more about their nature, like the amount of pleasure or pain , by running mathematical analyses based on the harmonic frequencies they contain rather than asking the person to report how they feel via language. Structural approaches and math surely have their limits. Galileo kicked off the scientific method by assuming that the universe is “written in the language of mathematics,” which demotes the ineffable depths of human experience to, apparently, something irrelevant to science. Reviving that idea with more advanced math would be a mistake . But language, maybe by design, will never capture the full richness of consciousness. That might be to our benefit, helping us generalize our experience in an ever-uncertain world. Meanwhile, more precise mathematical structures to describe conscious experience could also bring welcome benefits, from grasping just how intense pain can be to conveying the most blissful of pleasures.

"2","Amy Casciani, a longtime real estate developer whose corporation built housing across seven states, watched her local community struggle for years to add new homes. Casciani grew up in upstate New York, in a suburban town outside Rochester. She eventually started a family and raised her children there, and in the early 1990s, a new mall opened up, bringing over 100 new stores including anchor retailers like Sibley’s, J.C. Penney, and Sears. The mall was a proud boon to the town of Irondequoit, and a go-to spot for teenagers to hang out. “Hands down the most attractive shopping mall in the area,” an editorial for a newspaper serving Albany declared . “From its blue Legolike entrances and splashing fountain to its light-trimmed glass roof, columns and carousel, the mall exudes carnival gaiety.” But in a few short years, retail patterns across the United States began to change. Mall foot traffic slowed and online shopping ticked up. Stores in the Irondequoit Mall began to close, and by 2016, the last major anchor, Sears, called it quits . Casciani ached for her town, which not only was dealing with the eyesore of the abandoned mall but also lacked enough vacant land to develop desperately needed affordable housing. Her nonprofit development group, PathStone, embarked on a complex but meaningful project: They retrofitted the Sears department store into 73 rental apartments and built a new four-story multifamily building with 84 rental units on the adjacent parking lot. PathStone connected the two buildings by a raised pedestrian walkway, and the Skyview Park Apartments now serves adults 55 and up who need subsidized housing. Half of the units are reserved for seniors at risk of homelessness, who can receive on-site supportive services. Skyview Park Apartments Don Cochran “As affordable housing needs and costs keep going up and a shortage of available vacant land is growing, why not use what we already have?” Casciani said. “Why not creatively turn it around from being a blight on the community to an asset?” Across the country, policymakers, researchers, and real estate developers are paying more attention to mall conversions like the one in Irondequoit as they grapple with their own shortage of affordable housing. While the Irondequoit Mall was a traditional mall, strip malls in particular offer some unique advantages, like big empty parking lots, that could make housing redevelopment an easier task. A report last fall from Enterprise Community Partners, a national nonprofit focused on increasing housing supply, estimated that strip mall conversions could create more than 700,000 new homes across the United States. In 2022, California lawmakers passed a statewide law to help facilitate the conversion of empty commercial buildings to housing, with supporters cheering the law’s potential to “ unlock ” tons of previously unavailable land. The Biden administration is also excited about the possibility of converting more vacant strip malls into housing, and in October , released new federal guidance to help leaders and developers navigate the unfortunately complex financing process. “It’s not going to be a panacea,” said one senior official who works on the White House’s housing policy and was not authorized to speak publicly. “But it could have a range of self- reinforcing benefits for community and economic development, housing and employment.” The biggest barrier to strip mall conversions is zoning An old mall on a 23-acre plot of land in a town about 10 miles northwest of Boston was in obvious decline. When a developer bought the property for $44 million in 2017, two-thirds of the retail spaces were vacant. By 2021, new apartments were ready to rent on the property, and today the Woburn Village has 350 rental units, amenities like a fitness center and a swimming pool, and retailers that include Sephora and Panera. Photo courtesy of EDENS Turning the struggling Woburn Mall into the bustling Woburn Village has been hailed as a great success, but what has made conversions like it so rare is that local zoning laws often preclude them. Many communities have laws barring homes and businesses from coexisting on the same parcel. “Perhaps most often, the primary barrier toward redevelopment is regulatory,” concluded a report from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), which serves 101 cities and towns in the Boston region. The MAPC analyzed the potential for more strip mall conversions across the Greater Boston area and found over 3,000 strip malls sitting on thousands of acres of land. If just the top 10 percent of those candidates were converted into mixed-use development, the planning agency said, more than 125,000 new housing units could be built. Enterprise Community Partners replicated this analysis to get its estimate of creating over 700,000 new homes nationally by repurposing strip malls, including 300,000 “lower-density” multifamily housing units (such as duplexes, triplexes, and townhouses), and over 400,000 “medium-density” housing units (defined as a property with up to six stories and an average unit size of 1,100 square feet). Photo courtesy of EDENS Across the US, there is 947.5 million square feet of strip mall space, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. “We just looked at the 10 percent that were most well-suited for conversion based on factors like parcel size, proximity to transit, conditions, and vacancy, but it could be much more than that if you changed some of those assumptions,” said Ahmad Abu-Khalaf, a senior research analyst who wrote the Enterprise report. Like the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, Abu-Khalaf sees rewriting local zoning laws as the biggest barrier to conversions, which is why California authorizing retrofits statewide two years ago was such a big deal. This summer, a California state agency that oversees building code regulations went a step further and voted to make it even easier for developers to convert commercial property into new housing. States could follow California’s example or pass alternative incentives that encourage local cities to update their zoning rules. The idea is spreading Following the pandemic and the growth of remote work, policymakers grew more interested in converting empty office buildings into housing, especially those located in dense, urban areas. But such conversions have often been harder and more expensive than leaders originally envisioned. Strip malls, on the other hand, offer some unique opportunities. As Abu-Khalaf noted, many strip malls nationwide are already more than seven decades old and need long-backlogged repairs. The maintenance cost for these older buildings is often more expensive than the cost of just demolishing them and rebuilding. Strip malls are also typically built on property that includes large amounts of surface parking, which can make it easier for developers to build new projects. In Atlanta, for example, a shopping center that opened in the 1960s was bulldozed last year to make way for nearly 700 new housing units, including townhomes and multifamily apartments. The senior housing official said converting strip malls could be particularly important as the nation’s housing crisis has spread out beyond just high-cost cities. Today, workers and families struggle to find housing near jobs even in suburban and rural areas, and many strip malls are located in the suburbs. In 2023, the Biden administration opened up more funding for such housing conversions and directed agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development to prioritize these types of requests. The General Services Administration, which helps manage and support federal agencies, also put out new guidance emphasizing which federal properties could potentially be redeveloped into new housing. Since October, according to the White House, more real estate developers have expressed interest in tapping into these resources and technical assistance for new projects. “This is not an easy development to accomplish, but I believe it’s a necessary one to accomplish,” Casciani, the real estate developer from New York, told me. “I think it can make an even bigger impact on communities than new construction.” Will you support Vox today?

"2","The best thing about the X-Men is the deep, almost hilariously intense lore of Marvel’s merry mutants. In the comic books , Dark Phoenix (inhabiting the body of Jean Grey) ate an entire sun and doomed a race of aliens that look like broccoli. Magneto terraformed Mars , in large part to stunt on humans. Professor X can walk now and maybe isn’t as good a guy as we thought (he seems very into the idea of child soldiers). Storm is a goddess and a little bit of a witch . Iceman is gay . Jubilee detonates matter on a subatomic level. Cyclops’s eyes might not be lasers at all but rather portals into a place called the “ punch dimension ” that emit red blasts of concussive force. Unfortunately, when it comes to live-action adaptations of X-Men, writers haven’t been able to tap into all these delightfully tangential tidbits. You can only fit so much into a two-hour film release every few years. Lead actors demand the spotlight, and superhero movies aren’t really structured for soapy ensembles. The best adaptations understand what makes the X-Men so fun. Surprisingly, the animated cartoons deliver — in particular, the original animated show from the ’90s is legendary. Disney +’s X-Men ’ 97, which debuted last month, is a delightful, dedicated continuation of the original. The new show has been a critical success and, according to Disney , one of its most- watched shows. Positive conversation surrounding the show has lead to rumors that Marvel, in a rut of late , will be turning to a live-action X-Men adaptation sooner rather than later. But Marvel might be taking all the wrong lessons from this bolt of success. Equal parts soap, comedy, and save-the-day antics, ’ 97 works because it’s a charming rendition whose existence asserts a convincing argument: The X-Men don’t need a live-action movie if an animated series is this good. What makes X-Men ’ 97 so good? X-Men ’ 97 ’s most valuable quality is its elegant accessibility. The original animated series , which ran from 1992 to 1997, simplified decades of comic book storylines into digestible 30-minute episodes. Structurally, the cartoon borrowed elements of soap operas and sitcoms. That series was gateway viewing that converted many into casual fans. Even if viewers had never read the comic books, a generation of kids and teens still knew that Storm threw lightning bolts, Jean Grey moved things with her mind and fainted a lot, and that Rogue can punch people through trucks and sounds vaguely like Dolly Parton. Most of all: This mishmash of misfits were a family. The first few episodes of the classic cartoon focused on introducing the characters, their quirks, friendships, and differences, and the conflict — rescuing one of their own from mutant extermination machines called Sentinels — and showed how the X-Men can put their differences aside and work together. The stuff in between the lightning bolts, telekinesis, and super strength is what matters. ’97 continues that tradition, grounding the action by focusing on the beloved characters as they face a new era. The X-Men are dealing with the death of Professor X ( he died in the final episode of the ’90s series). Unfortunately, Professor X didn’t accomplish his dream of humanity and mutants living in peace. In fact, the political climate has gotten worse as more and more humans turn to bigotry and anti-mutant violence. The X-Men are sometimes absurd. Case in point: Jean Grey has a clone that, for some reason, not only has some of Jean Grey’s powers but also wields eldritch magic and calls herself the Goblin Queen. Her clone has a lot of hobbies and that’s fun! Courtesy of Marvel Animation Each mutant sees the world they’re living in with varying degrees of hope and mourning. Jean and Storm, best friends, have a heart to heart about the idea of raising children in this environment. Rogue, who has the power to absorb someone’s energy and life force if she’s not careful, has a wistful conversation with Gambit about being able to physically comfort one another. Jubilee, a mall rat with disco firework powers, just wants a few seconds to dance at a nightclub. What good is saving the world if you can’t find the time to enjoy it? Everything about ’97 reflects an affection and thoughtfulness, not just for the Saturday morning cartoon but the X-Men, too. That understanding also means knowing that the X-Men have delightfully implausible and completely absurd plot twists. In its third episode, we find out that beloved telepath Jean Grey has a clone who, for some reason, refers to herself as a Goblin Queen and has magic demon powers. Similarly, in episode four, a television -obsessed villain named Mojo captures Jubilee and places her into a video game. No one knows exactly why Jean Grey’s clone is invested in hell-themed sorcery or why Mojo would rather put his victims in an arcade world. Can’t a woman have hobbies? Can’t a clone dabble in the dark arts? Can’t a villain be obsessed with Nintendo? Sometimes all you can do, and what ’97 does, is simply shrug and chalk it up to the X-Men being the X-Men. What if an animated X-Men series is the X-Men’s best future? While a live-action X-Men movie could be fantastic, astonishing even, Fox’s history and track record suggests that’s easier said than done. The issue of making ensemble superhero movies and fleshing out more than two characters at a time can be difficult (though Guardians has done it extremely well). There’s also the issue of fitting them into an already-packed MCU and getting all those heroes — Shang-Chi, Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, Monica Rambeau, Shuri, et al. — on the same page. And Marvel has to figure out which villains it’s going to use, now that it has dropped its plans for Jonathan Majors’s Kang ; Majors was found guilty of assaulting and harassing his now ex-girlfriend in 2023. What makes the X-Men so difficult for live-action adaptation is that the X-Men’s powers are so grandiose and astounding that it makes set pieces and design virtually impossible. Storm, for example, has the power to manipulate the weather in the form of tornadoes and lightning and can even create a cosmic wormhole. Having a live-action version of those feats would require not only tons of CGI, but also a battlefield that allows for powers of that scale, and a galactic villain who could go toe to toe with Storm. Now add in more X-Men, some of whom like Magneto and Jean Grey are as powerful as Storm, and basically every battle would have to be huge — for scale, imagine the Wakanda invasion in Infinity War or the final fight in Endgame . Look at how sparkly and fun this is! While some X-Men movies are great, they’ve never been fun and sparkly! Courtesy of Marvel Animation Though it’s been done — specifically the fight scene in Days of Future Past — that might not be feasible in every movie. Animation doesn’t limit the X-Men the way live-action might. Many of the X-Men’s previous live- action movies have dialed back the X-Men’s powers, making them less flashy and easier to depict. While characters like the shape-shifting Mystique and Wolverine get more of the spotlight, it leaves out goofy moments like Storm fighting with a man with mutant hair or the all-powerful Jean Grey fighting for her entire life against Toad , a supervillain with mutant spit. GIVE THEM THE FORECAST pic.twitter.com/imtpNbFbT5 — Kemetic Introverted Vibe (@sijonefer) March 21, 2024 In the opening episode of ’97, there’s a gorgeous sequence in which Storm is rightfully classified as an “omega level threat,” a.k.a. a mutant with cataclysmic powers. Seeing that her team needs help, she comes swooping down, using lightning to transform the sand beneath her feet into glass and whipping those giant shards into a Sentinel-shredding tornado. It’s a creative and ambitious depiction of her powers, unlikely to have been as massive or stylish in live action. As far as the potential that animation offers, look no further than Spider-Verse movies and their inventive depiction of the multiverse and different worlds like Mumbattan (the combination of Mumbai and Manhattan on a different Earth). Netflix’s sumptuous Castlevania series and its gorgeous fight scenes also come to mind, achieving mood and awe in ways that a realistic depiction couldn’t. Conversely, both of Fox’s X-Men franchises attempted to depict the Dark Phoenix Saga, a story about how Jean Grey becomes a galactic threat. Now imagine how much more spectacular that could’ve been with the right animation team. Live-action X-Men movies can be pretty good. We’ve seen them. But we haven’t yet seen how great an animated X-Men feature could be. Maybe it’s time. Will you support Vox today? We believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.

"2","Suits may be having a moment, but when it comes to compelling legal drama, Bravo has had the TV genre on lock. The past few years have been rife with court cases: Jen Shah’s fraud case and subsequent prison sentencing made Real Housewives of Salt Lake City appointment TV, while Erika Jayne’s ex-husband’s embezzlement case — the disbarred attorney stands accused of stealing from the relatives of airplane crash victims — gave Real Housewives of Beverly Hills one of its buzziest storylines in years. However, the same court drama viewers have become accustomed to watching on Bravo is currently affecting the network off-screen, as several ex-Bravolebrities are laying out behind-the-scenes grievances with producers through legal means. A sexual harassment lawsuit against Bravo filed by former Real Housewives of New Jersey star Caroline Manzo appears to be stalling a season of the Peacock spinoff Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip . Meanwhile, former RHOBH star Brandi Glanville, Manzo’s alleged assailant, is threatening to sue Bravo for its treatment of her following the controversy. Additionally, ex- Real Housewives of New York cast member Leah McSweeney is suing Bravo and Real Housewives executive producer Andy Cohen for discrimination and retaliation. (She’s also accused Cohen of doing cocaine with Real Housewives, which could become a war of its own .) Shortly after McSweeney’s filing, Cohen’s attorney, Orin Snyder, responded with a letter, claiming her complaint was “littered with false, offensive, and defamatory statements.” Most recently, Faith Stowers, formerly of Vanderpump Rules , sued the network and the show’s producers for “racism, sexual harassment, and physical assault.” Her allegations stem from a 2018 incident where several cast members attempted to frame Stowers for a crime and were later fired by Bravo in 2020. There’s also former Vanderpump Rules star Rachel Leviss, who’s surprisingly not attempting to sue Bravo post-Scandoval . Rather, she’s brought a lawsuit alleging eavesdropping and revenge porn against her co-stars Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix, regarding an explicit FaceTime call Sandoval recorded, which exposed the affair. This isn’t the first time Bravo has been legally confronted over the way shows are made. In 2022, Real Housewives of Atlanta OG NeNe Leakes sued Bravo for racial discrimination (she later dropped it). And last year, former RHONY star Bethenny Frankel made somewhat inconsistent and confusing efforts toward a “reality reckoning,” which mostly manifested in a podcast series. However, her outspokenness about pay disparity, unsafe working conditions, and the general power dynamic between reality stars and producers has clearly had a ripple effect in the Bravo community. But as the Real Housewives universe continues to expand and grow in popularity, stars of these programs are finally wondering who’s responsible for their own reality. Which reality stars are suing Bravo right now? During last year’s SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, Frankel announced her efforts toward a reality-TV union in a Variety interview. In August, defense lawyers Mark Geragos and Bryan Freedman, reportedly representing Frankel and other reality stars, sent NBCUniversal (which owns Bravo and Peacock) a formal request to preserve documents potentially relevant to a lawsuit. In it, they accused the media company of “grotesque and depraved mistreatment” and covering up “acts of sexual violence.” (An NBCUniversal spokesperson responded that the company is “committed to maintaining a safe and respectful workplace” and takes “timely, appropriate action” toward complaints.) Since then, Frankel’s claimed she’s “not hiring lawyers” nor suing Bravo but helping other aggrieved reality stars seek justice. While not the first to confront reality producers over working conditions, she seems to have provided fellow Bravolebs a framework for addressing the power dynamics in their workplaces. On January 26, Deadline reported that Manzo was suing Bravo and its affiliated companies — NBCUniversal, Shed Media, Forest Productions, Warner Bros. Entertainment, and Peacock TV — for “encouraging” and “allowing” Glanville to sexually harass her during the filming of the Morocco-set season of Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip . In the complaint , Manzo’s attorneys detail that Glanville allegedly “[held] MANZO down with her body” and “thrust her tongue in MANZO’s mouth” during a party. When Manzo got up to go to the bathroom, she claims that Glanville followed her and continued to assault her. Strikingly, Manzo is not suing Glanville for sexual harassment or assault. Instead, her lawsuit seeks to hold Bravo responsible for hiring Glanville despite her “prior deviant sexual proclivities and sexually harassing conduct” as well as “ply[ing] GLANVILLE with copious amounts of alcohol so that she would act outrageous.” She’s seeking unspecified damages. Former Real Housewives of New Jersey cast member Caroline Manzo at BravoCon 2022 in New York City. Santiago Felipe/Getty Images Alcohol is also relevant in McSweeney’s complaint, which is already proving to be a larger point of contention among fans. Before she filed court documents, the streetwear founder had spoken publicly about producers’ alleged disregard for her and other cast members’ sobriety on RHONY and season three of RHUGT in a Vanity Fair exposé . In her lawsuit, McSweeney accuses Bravo and its third-party producers of “engaging in guerrilla-type psychological warfare intended to pressurize [her] into a psychological break and cause [her] to relapse.” Most of her accusations focus on producers’ alleged failure to accommodate her “bipolar, depression, and anxiety disorders,” in addition to her alcohol addiction. In her complaint, she references an incident where she was allegedly prohibited from leaving filming to visit her dying grandmother or else be terminated. Critical commenters on social media have argued that it is McSweeney’s personal responsibility to maintain her own sobriety. But Dan Braverman, an employment law attorney at Romano Law, says her addiction to alcohol can be deemed “a disability under federal, state, and local discrimination laws.” “This would necessitate that McSweeney be provided reasonable accommodations and not be discriminated against or fired for that reason,” he told Vox. While Braverman notes that McSweeney’s status as a contract worker would typically complicate this situation, in New York, where McSweeney has filed her complaint, the City Human Rights Law says that all independent contractors “have the right to receive reasonable accommodations for needs related to disabilities.” Still, some viewers say that McSweeney’s claims are undermined by her past behavior on the franchise. In her first season of RHONY , she says she started drinking again six months prior to filming. A clip of McSweeney encouraging her RHUGT cast members to drink because they were boring her has since resurfaced . Naysayers also point out that she chose to return to Bravo following her negative experiences on RHONY . While this doesn’t automatically disprove her claims — people return to unpleasant job situations out of necessity — it could be used against her in court, according to Braverman. “If McSweeney voluntarily chose to enter this environment again by rejoining the show and encouraging the behavior she is now alleging was discriminatory, the defense could argue that she contributed to some or all of her damages,” he said. Who’s to blame for reality? Still, the overwhelmingly critical response to McSweeney’s claims reflects a moral quandary that’s always undermined the pleasure of viewing reality TV — especially in the Bravo universe. That dilemma has become more pronounced as high-stakes, “earth-shattering” drama has increasingly become the norm and desired outcome on Bravo. But after an explosive cheating scandal that incites cyberbullying or a storyline that culminates in a DUI , who’s responsible for the devastation that’s left behind? As demonstrated by Manzo, McSweeney, Leakes, and Frankel, that question of accountability is partially a legal matter regarding what reality performers are owed. As Braverman noted, most reality stars are independent contractors — not employees, who are more thoroughly protected under federal laws. Nevertheless, legality doesn’t always overlap with morality. Nor do the current state of employment laws negate the ethical problem of reality performers being overworked, underpaid, mistreated, or placed in harmful work environments. Still, the point at which producers are expected to intervene when, say, a Real Housewife has too much to drink remains murky. At the very least, it should probably happen when someone, as Manzo’s alleging, is committing a crime against another person. But what about when someone is destroying their own life? How does production proceed when, unlike McSweeney, a reality star isn’t even aware that they could potentially be an addict and can also continue their alcohol consumption off-camera? The issue has presented itself with Real Housewives of Orange County cast member Shannon Beador, who received a DUI last year following a hit-and-run and was sentenced to three years of probation. For several seasons now, including the latest season 17, Beador’s drunken behavior has been a point of concern amongst her castmates, and she’s repeatedly denied having a problem. This type of personal wreckage makes for “good” TV, which is ultimately good for Bravo. Likewise, producers and editors have seemingly played into Beador’s drinking storyline, drawing comedy from her habit of making inebriated phone calls to her fellow Housewives and forgetting them the next day. Shortly after her DUI arrest, she was also permitted to attend Bravo’s annual convention, BravoCon — her presence being somewhat of a draw for the event. There, she announced that she completed “28 days of behavioral wellness” with an alcohol specialist. Beador has been a thoroughly compelling and enjoyable person to watch outside her troubling drinking habits. However, her story arc represents the risk and subsequent discomfort of capturing someone’s life over a long period of time, which can often illuminate a pattern of dangerous habits and poor decision- making. It’s different from watching a competition show like The Bachelor and Love Island where cast members are placed in a temporary, more controlled setting. On more loosely structured, slice-of-life shows like Real Housewives or Vanderpump Rules, there is an understanding that the cast is partially narrativizing their own lives. It’s common knowledge that these plots are produced and edited to varying degrees. But in the case of having a seven- month-long affair with your close friend’s life partner, for example, those facts can’t really be manipulated. This reality makes Leviss’s lawsuit post- Scandoval a little harder to swallow. Vanderpump Rules stars Ariana Madix, Tom Sandoval, Rachel Leviss, and Tom Schwartz at Hotel Cafe in 2021 in Los Angeles, California. Araya Doheny/Getty Images Following the scandal, Leviss decided to forgo filming the subsequent season 11. Instead, she launched a podcast called Rachel Goes Rogue , detailing her side of the controversy. She also appeared on Just B with Bethenny Frankel , where she discussed the machinations behind her so-called “villain edit.” Without downplaying the potential harm Madix and Sandoval may have caused in this dirty FaceTime debacle, it’s hard not to view her lawsuit as an attempt to regain control of a narrative where she inarguably cast herself as a villain. Plenty of Bravolebrities are already doing this by way of podcasts and tell-all interviews . But Leviss’s lawsuit represents a new method in which Bravolebs may be handling the dissatisfaction and humiliation they experience on their shows in the future and are already presently doing. For now, it’s unclear whether Madix actually distributed the video, and if she did, whether it was with an intent to harm Leviss. What’s more firmly laid out in the complaint, though, is a power dynamic where Bravo and other Vanderpump Rules cast members benefited from her bad decisions. Overall, it seems like reality stars and fans are still reconciling whether this is an ethical issue or just the inherent bargain of doing reality TV. Maybe it’s both. Update, April 10, 3:31 pm ET: This piece was originally published on March 17 and has been updated to include a recent lawsuit brought by Faith Stowers, a former Vanderpump Rules cast member, against Bravo and the show’s producers.

"2","A new Vatican document released April 8 details how the Catholic Church approaches human dignity, but it has raised concern among LGBTQ parishioners and their allies about how it describes gender-affirming surgery . The document, entitled “Dignitas Infinita” (“Infinite Dignity”), was five years in the making and lays out the ways the Vatican believes the inherent dignity that each person possesses can be honored and protected. Though largely in line with positions the Catholic Church has expressed in the past, it’s notable for elevating some of the church’s most conservative views into doctrine — essentially, official church teachings — during a period in which the current pope has been seen as trying to steer the organization in a more progressive, inclusive direction . Broadly, the document highlights “grave violations” of human dignity, including war, poverty, mistreatment of migrants, and abuse of women. It also lists other perceived threats, including abortion and what the Vatican describes as “gender theory” and “sex change.” In these provisions, the document criticizes gender-affirming procedures and stresses that the Vatican views gender as a clear binary between men and women. “While Pope Francis has made greater strides in affirming LGBTQ+ Catholics than any of his predecessors, his endorsement of ‘Dignitas Infinita’ will be seen as turning the clock back by transgender individuals, both within and outside the church,” R. Andrew Chesnut, the Bishop Sullivan Chair in Catholic Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, told Vox. The release of “Dignitas Infinita” comes amid a larger political, cultural, and social discourse about trans rights and medical care , including a recent UK report on the subject. LGBTQ Catholics and advocates fear, too, that it will worsen a climate in which some governments have enacted laws that attack trans people — including numerous GOP bans on gender-affirming care for children in the US — and be used to fuel more discrimination. “The document should not be dismissed as simply an abstract theological conversation with few human consequences,” Francis DeBernardo, the executive director of New Way Ministries, an LGBTQ Catholic group, said in a statement. “Rather, the Vatican is again supporting and propagating ideas that lead to real physical harm to transgender, nonbinary, and other LGBTQ+ people.” The Vatican document challenges attempts at inclusion Under Pope Francis, the Vatican has sought to lead a more inclusive Catholic Church, including approving blessings for same-sex couples and allowing women to vote in a major bishops’ meeting for the first time. Francis has also personally made overtures to the trans community, approving the baptizing of trans parishioners and welcoming a group of trans women to a weekly gathering. However, as “Dignitas Infinita” exemplifies, such progress toward inclusivity has been halting, with the church still declining to permit marriage for same-sex couples and barring women from becoming priests . The document’s treatment of trans people continues this pattern by emphasizing the need to acknowledge every person’s human dignity while offering “limited dignity” to trans people, DeBernardo said . In particular, it argues that gender-affirming procedures threaten the dignity that a person is born with at conception, claiming that such medical care interferes with “the need to respect the natural order of the human person.” The document also broadly denounces “gender theory,” which includes “argu[ing] that a person’s gender can be different from the sex that person was assigned at birth,” NPR’s Jason DeRose explains. “​​That ‘Dignitas Infinita’ rebukes gender transition interventions as a rejection of God’s plan of human life implies that those individuals who have elected to transition ... have violated divine will,” said Chesnut. Jason Steidl, a professor of religious studies at St. Johns University who specializes in Catholicism, put it more bluntly. “This is the Newsmax version of Catholic theology,” he said. The Vatican’s statements have been widely lambasted by trans members of the Catholic Church who view them as undermining their experiences and their place in the church. “Transgender people are beloved, intentional creations of God the same as cisgender men and women are,” Michael Sennett, a trans man and practicing Catholic in Massachusetts, told the Associated Press. Steidl and others, however, see the doctrine as satisfying a more conservative arm of the Catholic Church. The pope’s announcement in late 2023, for example, that the Vatican would support priests blessing same-sex couples in certain contexts drew ire from numerous clergymen globally . Those opposed to Francis’s more progressive actions included some in Africa, one of the places where the Catholic Church has seen high growth in recent years, who called it “contrary to the will of God.” According to Steidl, who is also the author of LGBTQ Catholic Ministry , the provisions going after trans people in the Vatican’s document were likely an attempt to appease this segment of the church. “Cardinal Fernandez, the head of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of Faith, had essentially said that they were going to be throwing traditionalists a bone,” Steidl told Vox. The church doctrine adds to policies attacking trans people LGBTQ advocates worry the Vatican’s document will only be further ammunition for conservatives in the political and social spheres as they advance discriminatory policies, particularly as political attacks on trans people have surged in recent years. At least 19 GOP-led state legislatures in the US have passed laws either restricting or outright banning access to gender-affirming care, even though major physician organizations have deemed such care medically necessary . As the number of anti-trans laws has spiked, a report from the National Center for Transgender Equality has documented an increase in homicides of transgender people in the US between November 2022 and November 2023. European countries are also taking a more restrictive approach to health care for trans people — particularly for minors. Recently, a report commissioned by the United Kingdom’s National Health Service questioned current transition practices in pediatrics and reiterated recommendations to reduce the use of puberty blockers, a treatment the NHS has already stopped offering for minors with gender dysphoria. LGBTQ advocates are concerned that the Vatican’s document will just add to rhetoric globally that has sought to curtail trans rights. “This document … tells trans people that they are a threat to the world, that they are a threat to order, to the systems that God has set up,” Steidl told Vox. “Unfortunately, the Vatican is contributing to these movements that seek to hurt trans people, that seek to eliminate them.” Will you support Vox today?

"1","Let’s suppose, for a moment, that you are in charge of choosing the date for the Democratic National Convention — you know, the event where pledged delegates representing the states and superdelegates representing the establishment (a rather useless distinction, all things considered) cast ballots for the party’s presidential candidate. There are, of course, a number of factors to consider: When is the venue available? When are key speakers and attendees (like the president of the United States) available? Are other major events taking place in Chicago around the same time that could cause problems for traffic, lodging, etc.? (READ MORE: Biden’s Never-Ending Lies Spawn a New Generation of Liars ) But perhaps the most important question to consider is: When are the filing deadlines for a party to put a candidate on the ballot in each of the 50 states? Ideally, the convention should end and the party should select its candidate before any of those filing deadlines pass. Ideally. That is the purpose of the convention, after all. Unlike most of the other logistical questions Democrats have had to answer in picking a date for their national convention, filing deadlines for each state can be found in about 0.36 seconds with a simple Google search (I timed it). (READ MORE: Biden’s Loan Amnesty Passes the Buck ) Filing deadlines also rarely change. Alabama, for instance, has had the same filing deadline since 1975 , and Ohio has required parties to submit candidates for the ballot 90 days prior to an election for quite a few election cycles now. That’s not to say the legislatures in those respective states haven’t bent the rules on occasion (Ohio did for both the Republican and Democrat Party in 2020), but, in general, the law remains rather predictable. The filing deadlines in Alabama and Ohio are Aug. 15 and Aug. 7, respectively. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Chicago from Aug. 17 to Aug. 22 (the Republican National Convention is in July, well before any state’s filing deadlines). Therein lies a slight problem. The convention will simply take place too late to make either state’s ballots. This past week, the election offices of both Alabama and Ohio informed the Democrat Party that either the convention would have to take place earlier, or the state would have to make an exception — something that can only be done by the legislature (which is predominantly Republican in both states). (READ MORE: Pelosi and 36 Democrats Were Dying to Kiss the Hand of Hamas ) Joe Biden’s election campaign sounds very sure that an exception will be made for the president of the United States. “Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states,” one Biden campaign spokesperson said. “State officials have the ability to grant provisional ballot access certification prior to the conclusion of presidential nominating conventions.” The spokesperson isn’t wrong. Whether or not the state officials and legislatures in question are Republican, they’re unlikely to stand their ground and keep Biden off the ballot because the DNC won’t follow the rules. One wonders if Democrat state officials would make an exception if the roles were reversed. I suppose we’ll never know. Republicans (wisely) aren’t giving them the same excuse to bar Donald Trump from state’s ballots."
"1","T his Tuesday marked the 159th anniversary of Robert E. Lee’s surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox — the beginning of the end of a bitter and bloody civil war. From the modern American perspective, it’s almost impossible to comprehend the sheer scope of what the Civil War was. Over the course of just four years, the fighting claimed an estimated 620,000 young American soldiers’ lives — the equivalent of more than 6 million as a share of today’s U.S. population . In his farewell message to his troops the day after his surrender, Lee wrote : I need not tell the survivors of so many hard fought battles who have remained steadfast to the last, that I have consented to this result from no distrust of them. But feeling, that valor and devotion could accomplish nothing that would compensate the loss that would attend the continuance of the contest — I determined to avoid the useless sacrifice of those whose finest services have endeared them to their countrymen. By the terms of the agreement Officers and men can return to their homes and remain until exchanged. You will take with you the satisfaction that proceeds from the consciousness of duty faithfully performed, and I earnestly pray that a merciful God will extend to you His blessing and protection — With unceasing admiration of your constancy and devotion to your country, and a grateful remembrance of your kind and generous consideration of myself, I bid you an affectionate farewell. This year, however, the anniversary of this solemn moment was occasion for gleeful crowing from the left-wing corners of the internet. “Happy Traitors Surrendering Day,” one young Virginia Democrat wrote . “F*** Robert E. Lee, f*** the Confederacy, and f*** their cause of treason.” A widely shared video featured a woman chugging “rebel tears” to celebrate the Confederacy “taking a fat f***ing L.” (Gratuitous vulgarity seems to be a feature of this discourse.) The famous left-wing hacker group Anonymous added , “On this day (April 9th, 1865) the Confederacy surrendered after getting it’s [ sic ] ass kicked.” The gloating ritual here has become something of an annual affair. On the 2019 anniversary of Lee’s surrender, the American Civil Liberties Union took the opportunity to call for the removal of Lee’s statue from the capital of his home state of Virginia. In 2015, on the 150th anniversary, the New York Times published an op-ed scolding Americans for uncritically celebrating the event — which the author dubbed a “dangerous myth” — in the first place, mourning the fact that, in the memory of Appomattox, “white Americans fashioned a story of prodigal sons returning for a happy family portrait.” That same year, the New Republic used the anniversary as an opening to call for the destruction and renaming of Confederate monuments across the country, writing , “We aren’t being polite to anyone worthy of politeness, or advancing any noble end, by continuing to honor traitors in this way.” What is notable about all this is its novelty. The Confederate statues and monuments that are now being toppled, desecrated, and melted down were originally established in the spirit of honor — a desire to commemorate and memorialize the sacrifices of the Confederate soldiers, which were woven into the South’s sense of self, even (or perhaps especially) in defeat. This was seen as a necessary feature of the process of national reconciliation and grew out of the mutual respect that Lee and Grant displayed for one another. In the Federalist , John Daniel Davidson writes : Grant’s terms of surrender were remarkable for their leniency on the Confederate Army…At this crucial moment, it was most important to Grant and Lee that the soldiers return home safely and get on with civilian life as soon as possible. Returning to his men, Lee told them, “I have done the best I could for you. Go home now, and if you make as good citizens as you have soldiers, you will do well, and I shall always be proud of you.” En route back to his headquarters, Grant heard salutes and cheering begin to rise up from nearby Union batteries. He sent orders to have them stopped. “The war is over,” he said. “The rebels are our countrymen again.” The Civil War itself, of course, was characterized by terrible brutality, and both sides meted out unconditional destruction upon one another at varying junctures. (To this day, some parts of the South still hold grudges regarding the brutality of Sherman’s March to the Sea — which, in Gen. Sherman’s own words , sought to “make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war.”) But as the war drew to a conclusion, the Northern victors displayed a kind of martial honor that is utterly foreign to many of those who lay claim to their legacy today. Union Gen. Joshua Chamberlain went so far as to order his men to stand at attention and salute as the conquered Confederate troops marched by, reasoning that “at such a time and under such conditions I thought it eminently fitting to show some token of our feeling.” In a later account of the scene, Chamberlain wrote : For us they were fellow- soldiers as well, suffering the fate of arms. We could not look into those brave, bronzed faces, and those battered flags we had met on so many fields where glorious manhood lent a glory to the earth that bore it, and think of personal hate and mean revenge. Whoever had misled these men, we had not. We had led them back, home. Whoever had made that quarrel, we had not. It was a remnant of the inherited curse for sin. We had purged it away, with blood- offerings. We were all of us together factors of that high will which, working often through illusions of the human, and following ideals that lead through storms, evolves the enfranchisement of man. Forgive us, therefore, if from stern, steadfast faces eyes dimmed with tears gazed at each other across that pile of storied relics so dearly there laid down, and brothers’ hands were fain to reach across that rushing tide of memories which divided us, yet made us forever one. This sort of patriotism, charity, and sense of sacred duty was felt, expressed, and demonstrated by many of the men of that time, on both the Northern and Southern side of the war. But what the Civil War was , as a matter of historical fact, and what it meant to the men who were there — as well as to the generations of Americans whose lives were shaped by its memory — has very little to do with the celebratory spirit that surrounds Appomattox now. Today’s vulgar cheers have very little to do with the Civil War at all. (RELATED: Robert E. Lee, the Man for These Hard Times ) Today’s gleeful celebration of Lee’s surrender is part and parcel of the same fervor that has sought to remove any positive commemoration of the Southern general and his counterparts from public life. It has nothing to do with the Confederacy, except insofar as the soiled memory of the Antebellum South can be mobilized to undermine, attack, and delegitimize Red America. The contemporary Left seeks to recast the white, conservative, Christian lumpenproletariat as the inheritors of slavery, segregation, and the numerous other crimes that have replaced men like Grant and Lee at the center of our new national mythology. Progressives are hardly ambiguous about this particular ambition. In a Salon essay about Appomattox in 2010, Glenn LaFantasie, a Civil War historian, wrote : The Confederacy, often depicted on maps as Red States (as opposed to Union Blue), may have lost the fighting — forcing Robert E. Lee to surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, 1865 — but the social and political values of those Red States live on, nurtured and sustained in a Republican Party that often sounds more Confederate in its ideology than Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederate States of America. This is the true meaning behind the gratuitous, jeering celebrations of Appomattox. It is not, as the anonymous X user Lunkhead noted , about “hating traitors” so much as it is about a fervent desire to punish contemporary enemies. Given the violent nature of the Confederacy’s demise, it’s reasonable to ask: Just what, exactly, are they giving themselves permission to do?"
"1","T he news from Moscow is that Russia is likely to abandon the 13 percent flat- rate income tax enacted in 2000, not long after a group of visiting conservative/libertarian American economists, including me, advised newly installed President Vladimir Putin to dramatically lower the country’s income tax. As I pointed out in this space last year, Russian economic growth flourished (over 7 percent annual economic growth) in Putin’s first two terms after the flat tax was adopted. Income tax revenues actually increased sharply, as transactions in the vast underground economy dramatically declined as individuals felt they could afford to be honest since the new tax burden was not oppressive. It is the Laffer Curve at work — tax rates fall, so economic activity dramatically expands, increasing tax revenues. Yet Russia is now suffering from fiscal strain. Its cash and gold reserves are small and declining. Trying to compete with much bigger nations economically, like the U.S. and China, is straining the economy, particularly given Russia’s territorial ambitions. Some things never change in Russia —Putin is Ivan the Terrible (1553–1584) without the charisma. The war with Ukraine is taking longer than expected and creating a drain on young productive human resources that Russia can ill afford, since an extremely low birth rate is producing relatively few war-worthy young men. Increasingly desperate for revenues, Putin apparently now is contemplating a progressive income tax. The American experience: The original 1913 tax had a single digit top rate (7 percent), but within a few years the maximum rate hit 77 percent, and it has never fallen below 25 percent since. History suggests that, like virginity, once lost, flat-rate or zero income taxation is usually gone forever. And this is very good news for America, Russia’s top adversary. (READ MORE from Richard K. Vedder: Malthus Reversed: The Birth Dearth and Our Future ) The experience of the 50 American states is instructive. Looking at Census Bureau estimates of population change from 2020 to 2023, we see enormous domestic migration into the nine U.S. states with the ultimate flat-rate state income tax — a zero rate. Some 1,818,421 persons net moved into those states from states with income taxes. Looking at the six states with top personal tax rates of 9 percent or higher (California, Hawaii, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon), every single one had a net out-flow of migrants, totaling an extraordinary 2,362,181. One of the great out-migrations in human history is occurring unpublicized by our woke media. Interestingly, tropical paradise Hawaii with extremely high taxes had a net out -migration of over 40,000 , while distinctly more frigid South Dakota gained nearly 20,000. Also, the 12 states with positive flat rates collectively had net in-migration from progressive rate states. Flat rates are loved, especially zero rates. Russia’s 2000 flat tax followed the policy initiatives of Prime Minister Mart Laar of Estonia as well as other Baltic states, all of whom have flourished relative to Russia and old large Western welfare states like France and Germany. And then there is Ireland, which used low flat-rate corporate income tax policies to trigger a massive income growth that is the envy of Europe . If Russians are like Americans, I would expect their move away from flat-rate to progressive taxes will prove quite unpopular. At the margin, will it by itself lead to revolt against a long reigning dictator who has gone from desperately flirting with free-market capitalism (Putin I, 2000–2008) to increasingly authoritarian kleptomania (Putin II, 2013–2024), trying to ignore market forces and human nature? Probably not. But in conjunction with other outrages, it might shorten Putin’s already too long political life expectancy. In speaking to conservative legislative groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council, I frequently joked that the only politician ever to do something that I recommended was Vladimir Putin. He listened and acted not out of awe of the wisdom of me and my colleagues but out of desperation. So likely nudged by his libertarian adviser Andrei Illarionov (now living in America), he concluded, “What we are doing isn’t working, and I don’t have the resources to restore Russia to its previous glory, so I will use what one newspaper called ‘Jesuit methods of managing the economy.’” It worked! Output nearly doubled in a decade. (READ MORE: Time to Amend the Constitution ) Putin’s predicament has been eased by incredibly inept policies by his adversaries, especially the United States, whose anti-fossil-fuel policies in the Biden era helped Russia maximize foreign exchange earnings, and whose comparative neglect of national defense encourages Russian adventurism. But as Putin ages and Russia’s population and economy stagnate, the current regime’s days are numbered.

"1","Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle recently wrote that the best argument made in favor of limiting the size of the stimulus during the Great Recession — part of a larger conversation about austerity — was one of ethos. “We weren’t spending the money in theory,” she wrote, “or in 1945, when an ethos of fiscal responsibility prevailed. We were spending it in the 21st century, when that ethos had collapsed, so there was a considerable chance that when the good times finally rolled around, no politician would willingly undertake the sacrifices necessary to get the budget back in shape.” She got me thinking about America’s fiscal norms. It’s fair to say that the ethos of sound fiscal and monetary policy started with none other than Alexander Hamilton. In his January 1790 Report on Public Credit, Hamilton advocated for fully funded permanent public debt. This report laid the groundwork for a financial system supported by securely backed debt together with commodity money. Later that year, Hamilton proposed the establishment of the Bank of the United States. Though not a central bank by today’s standards, he thought it crucial for securing federal credit and a stable currency. Hamilton recognized the interconnectedness of fiscal and monetary policies. Since then, the United States and most stable countries have developed norms guiding different kinds of policy behavior. U.S. monetary policy norms have largely evolved through legislative actions, shaping the roles and responsibilities of our central bank — the Federal Reserve — in managing the currency and responding to economic shifts. By contrast, according to University of Virginia economist Eric Leeper, America’s fiscal policy norms have emerged more informally. These have been shaped by historical practices and significantly influenced by Hamilton’s understanding of dynamic economic behavior. Contrary to monetary policy, which has fairly stable and clear policy objectives (a stable price level and full employment), fiscal-policy objectives are unclear and always changing. This makes the norms that guide policymakers more important. Leeper highlights three fiscal norms. One, established in one of Hamilton’s 1790 reports, is that budget deficits should be followed by budget surpluses (i.e., the government pays off its debts). The second is that ordinary spending should be paid for with taxes while emergency spending can be paid with borrowed funds to be repaid later. The third is that austerity becomes necessary when interest payments on outstanding debt become a sufficiently large fraction of federal expenditures. Despite their informal nature, these fiscal norms have historically constrained U.S. fiscal policy in a meaningful way, even without a gold standard or other formal devices often found in history. They’re also important because they determine long-term expectations for fiscal policy. These expectations, in turn, influence bond prices, inflation and the real economy, keeping things relatively stable. So far, adherence to these informal fiscal norms has paid off. U.S. Treasuries are a cornerstone of the global financial system, serving functions akin to money worldwide. However, the norms are weakening. While legislators have not abandoned the idea of repaying all the debt, they are making decisions that will eventually make it much more difficult. Further, since the Great Recession, emergency spending financed with debt hasn’t spurred the creation of fiscal surplus to repay it. A look at the debt-to-GDP ratio since 2008 shows an upward trajectory with no plans to return to pre-2008 levels. In addition, after the roughly $6 trillion in COVID emergency spending — and unlike the Obama administration post–Great Recession — the Biden administration has not acknowledged the need for austerity. Debt-service costs are going through the roof, with interest payments growing to $1 trillion a year and eclipsing defense and Medicare spending, yet the administration shows no notable willingness to course correct. In fact, as McArdle notes, “President [Joe] Biden isn’t talking about fiscal sanity; he’s talking about massive child-care subsidies” and about more student debt forgiveness. The fear is that eroding fiscal norms will change investors’ expectations about being repaid for government debt, something that comes with just about every bad economic consequence one can imagine. The breakdown can also affect monetary policy. With federal debt equaling 100 percent of GDP, most of it financed through short-term bonds, any interest rate hikes dramatically increase the budget deficit. This could affect the Fed’s ability and willingness to fight inflation with more rate hikes and further debt increases. An ethos of fiscal responsibility and healthy fiscal norms are a big deal. We should lament their erosion. Veronique de Rugy is the George Gibbs Chair in Political Economy and a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

"1","Most conservative women, if asked about the first wave of feminism, would voice general approval. It is seen as a rather pure approach to women’s issues, focused on protecting women and advancing political participation. Feminism’s problems, we have been led to understand, appeared only much later, sometime in the 1960s with the second wave and beyond. This general narrative has been repeated so frequently that I scarcely thought I had to research the first wave when I started writing my book The End of Woman: How Smashing the Patriarchy Has Destroyed Us . It was surprising to discover its much more coarse and colorful untold history. When my book was published, many thought it an outlier in its scrutiny of the common narrative, but the work of others continues to confirm that the first wave is not quite what we’ve been promised. Before going into the research of others, it is important to set the stage. The first wave extended through a very long and volatile period, from roughly the late 1700s until the 1960s. This era was marked by significant cultural upheaval, including political and industrial revolutions, the Civil War, the rise of democracies and end of monarchical rule, and the emergence of socialism/communism. Questions proliferated about women, their roles as wives and mothers, their work, and their place in society. During the first wave, large numbers of women became activists promoting suffrage, male chastity, and temperance. The women’s rights movement, however, was far from tidy and unified. Some were motivated by Christian principles; for others, especially the feminist movement’s leaders, inspiration came from Enlightenment, socialist, and esoteric thought. These new ways of thinking made the first wave far more radical and liberal than most realize. It was no prim and proper Victorian tea party. In my book, I define feminism according to the use of the leading feminists, not as it is used in common parlance today to mean something generally pro-women or pro–political rights. Feminism, based on the explicit vision of its leaders, can be defined as an ideology characterized by three things: 1) free love or the end of monogamous marriage; 2) the occult; and 3) restructuring society, or what is now known as “smashing the patriarchy.” What I discovered in my research was that all these elements generally thought to have developed in the second wave were in fact seeded in the first. Although there was certainly a variety of thought about women generally, among feminism’s leaders, these elements were readily and shockingly apparent. Witting and Unwitting Denunciations of First-Wave Feminism Several reviews of my book have challenged my scholarship, critiquing my analysis of the first wave as simply reactionary anti-feminism and an idiosyncratic caricature of the first-wave thinkers. But this is not the case. Mine is not the only scholarly critique of feminism’s first wave. In 2015, Dr. Janice Fiamengo, a retired professor of English from the University of Ottawa, began The Fiamengo File , a series of YouTube videos (and, later, her Substack ) focused on feminism’s devastating social effects. She also published the 2017 book Sons of Feminism: Men Have Their Say , featuring stories of men who have suffered because of feminist culture. Tammy Peterson interviewed Fiamengo four times for her podcast about first-wave feminism (see the episodes “ The Deception of Feminism ,” “ Modern Feminism Destroys American Women ,” “ Dismantling Feminism: The Untold Harm ,” and “ The Untold Victims of Feminism ”). Fiamengo, who for years had been a devoted feminist, explains, “Everyone thinks they know something about feminism, and that little that they think they know is almost completely wrong.” (READ MORE from Carrie Gress: The Women’s Vote and Feminism’s Triumph ) Those four episodes survey feminism from its beginnings, that is, from Mary Wollstonecraft up to the early 1900s. Fiamengo covers a vast array of historical information, context, and analysis. In “ Dismantling Feminism: The Untold Harm ,” she analyzes Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s Declaration of Sentiments , which is considered the foundational feminist document. Fiamengo critiques Stanton’s blanket statements, such as: “The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her.” Fiamengo argues that this claim is historically false and that history provides many, many counterexamples of men and women who did not live in this tyrannical type of relationship. Evidence abounds that there were entire communities living truly and simply Christian lives in which love and marriage were unsullied by the caricature of domination Stanton characterized. Fiamengo also explores an area that was new for me: the activities of Dame Christabel Harriette Pankhurst and her mother Emmeline Pankhurst, a mother-daughter team generally lionized as responsible for giving British women the right to vote in 1918. The militant tactics they carried out in the early 1900s, which involved well over 1,000 women, were akin to the kind of violence we witness today in organizations like Antifa and Black Lives Matter, such as firebombing homes and destroying businesses that didn’t openly support their effort. The Pankhursts and their allies even tampered with the mail, applying chemicals to letters that led to significant burns on the hands of mailmen. Another contribution to the critique of the first wave — this one unwittingly — is the 2022 book Hotbed: Bohemian Greenwich Village and the Secret Club that Sparked Modern Feminism by historian Joanna Scutts. Scutts, who champions feminism, discusses a secret women’s club founded in 1912 called “Heterodoxy .” It was named for the club’s only requirement: that a woman “ not be orthodox in her opinion .” Scutts explains that “feminism” was a word known to people at the time, although most didn’t really know what it meant, similar to how “woke” is used today. The women of Heterodoxy spent significant time and discussion trying to sort out its meaning and how it ought to be lived. This group of mostly affluent and well-educated women met in Greenwich Village, which was even then a hotbed for radical notions, especially the socialist and communist ideas from Eastern European and Russian immigrants. The Heterodoxy women worked to fill the void of feminism left by the deaths of leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Like the earlier first- wave feminists featured in my book, such as Mary Wollstonecraft, the Heterodoxy club focused on defining females as a person, or human being, in contrast to the normative understanding of woman as connected to fertility, children, and husbands. Scutts explains that Heterodoxy’s founder, unitarian minister Marie Jenney Howe, saw feminism as a quest to become “not just our little female selves, but our whole, big, human selves.” This overarching humanness meant “a changed psychology, the creation of a new consciousness in women.” This idea of changing or raising consciousness had already been used for several decades by socialists to fundamentally reshape society through women. Tinkering with the notion of woman has had diverse negative effects, such as jettisoning an understanding of human nature’s male-female complementarity and opening the door to today’s dizzying variety of genders. It also removes from women the reality of motherhood (physical, psychological, and spiritual) as the natural way in which we engage with the world. In short, and quite ironically, it has led to the prioritization of the male mode of life over a female one and a blurring of gender to the point that today most cannot even define “woman.” Perhaps the most famous among the Heterodoxy women was socialist economist and writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman. She believed motherhood made it “impossible for women to achieve their potential, and it exposed children to the risks of cruel or neglectful parenting.” Therefore, she thought that communal living or outsourcing childcare was better for both parents and children. She also authored the book Women and Economics , which Scutts describes as a “bible for progressive young women.” Scutts adds, “The prosaic title concealed a radical vision for overturning the patriarchy, in which the author compared marriage to prostitution.” While the names of the Heterodoxy women are little known today, their influence has been wide ranging. The 25 charter members included lesbians and bisexuals, labor radicals, and socialists. Among them were suffrage artist Lou Rogers, whose cartoons were the inspiration for Wonder Woman, and Crystal Eastman, co- founder of the American Civil Liberties Union. Their ideas of females as genderless persons, of communal or disengaged parenting, and of feminism’s general progressive vision were all used copiously by second wavers. These examples brought to light by Fiamengo and Scutts corroborate the ones in my book. The point they illustrate could not be clearer: First-wave feminism, far from simply supporting a benign vision of voting rights and education opportunities for women, already had the much more sinister elements that we see playing out from the 1960s to today. Is the First Wave a Model for Today? In light of the reality of first-wave feminism, how should its thoughtful critics respond to writers — especially those who are conservative — who advocate for the first wave as a model for young women to navigate current issues? It is certainly true that women need to find healthy ways both to understand what it means to be a woman and to thrive in relationship to others, as wives, mothers, professionals, and so on. Philosophically, the first wave’s intellectual shortcomings, which I address in greater detail in my book, are insufficient to restore what has been lost. And, more importantly, why would we want to build a new feminism (by grafting on, for example, the adjectives conservative , pro-life , or Christian ) upon the broken and distorted visions of the human person and the male-female relationship that lie at the root of the problems plaguing society today? If the root is poison, and it is, no amount of decoration will make it less lethal or more true. There is also a question of practicality. The problems women face today are vastly different from the travails of the first wave. We have rights and freedoms as well as daily conveniences that were hardly conceivable when the first wave launched. The landscape is radically different. Suffrage, temperance, and the question of whether women ought to be considered equals are hardly our pressing issues. Rather, we are plagued by the chaotic mess of the hook-up culture, sexual abuse, divorce, 28 percent of Gen Z identifying as LGBTQ, gender transitioning, willful sterilization, infertility, in vitro fertilization, and surrogate wombs. Even if feminism had been the best solution for the abuses of a bygone era, there is absolutely no reason to think that more feminism will solve the contemporary problems it has undeniably caused. Our current ills consist of fundamentally existential questions about identity, meaning, purpose, community, family, and what it means to be a woman. As I write in The End of Woman , Matt Walsh’s definition of a woman — an adult female human — is a start, but it is not enough. We must build a coherent vision of women and femininity that distinguishes us from men by embracing the fullness of motherhood (physical, psychological, and spiritual) without denying our shared human dignity as created in the image and likeness of God. What young women — and, really, all women — are suffering from are the effects of feminism’s successful destruction of what it targeted from the beginning: the family and faith. Trying to use the first wave, which ignited these issues, to fix this is an error that neither offers a way forward nor provides a way back to a true understanding of womanhood.

"1","SACRAMENTO — The issue of patents — the intellectual property rights granted to inventors that give them exclusive control over their invention — has long divided supporters of the free-market system. It’s always a contentious topic in libertarian circles, something that will generate more anger and name- calling at a libertarian event than discussions about, say, legalizing prostitution, the personal ownership of nuclear weapons , or the constitutionality of driver’s licenses. I exaggerate, but not by much. As Libertarianism.org explains , “We tend either to favor or oppose it strongly, depending on whether we see it as a necessary and proper guardian of legitimate individual rights, or a precarious and inherently unjust form of coercive monopolism.” Advocates for the former position argue that without such rights individuals would not be able to profit from their mental efforts and investments, whereas the latter believe them to be a government-imposed restriction on labor — and something that in the long run restricts the process of innovation. These are great debates to have over a cocktail, but there’s little chance that our nation will up-end the entire system of intellectual property . However, it is long overdue for policy makers to look at improving the way patents that currently are granted and defended. Obviously, pharmaceutical companies aren’t going to invest billions of dollars into ground-breaking research if someone else can come along and sell the pills at a lower cost without having to recoup the research costs. By contrast, even diehard patent supporters acknowledge the nefarious efforts of so-called patent trolls, who, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation defines , are “companies that don’t focus on making products or selling services” but instead “collect patents, then use them to threaten or sue other companies and individuals.” Furthermore, those above-mentioned drug makers often engage in dubious practices that slow the entry into the market of generic drugs, which leaves lifesaving medicines out of reach for millions of Americans. As my R Street Institute colleague Wayne Brough discussed in a research report last year: Many pharmaceutical companies employ strategic behaviors that extend rents well beyond the 20 years granted by the patent. Companies deploy tactics such as evergreening, patent thickets and product hopping to create artificial barriers to potential competitors seeking to enter the market with alternative products, resulting in delayed and higher prices for consumers. Evergreening is when patent holders file secondary patents that change tangential aspects of the product, such as packaging, dosing, or treatment methods, as a means mainly to extend the length of their monopoly protections. Patent thickets refer to a web of patents covering essentially the same product, which complicates the entry of others into the market. Finally, product hopping is when a manufacturer develops reformulated versions of the drug (e.g., a chewable rather than a tablet) or combines two separate drugs into a single drug. Per recent research , that single type of patent gaming imposed a $4.7 billion cost on the U.S. health care system based only on its impact on five particular drugs. It’s easy to understand why given that the current system empowers deep-pocketed patent holders to sue upstart competitors. It provides a chilling effect on competition and innovation in the drug market. U.S. policymakers have been considering a wide range of ideas to deal with soaring pharmaceutical costs. Most of these ideas are bad ones , as they involve price controls and other efforts that give the government more power over private industry. Even some of the most reasonable proposed reforms, such as empowering Medicare to negotiate prices with drug manufacturers, avoid tackling the deeper problem. Instead of expanding federal control, Congress should look at making a variety of tweaks to the patent system in order promote more competition. What should be done? Part of the problem stems from the bureaucratic nature of the patent-approval system, as such decisions are made by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It’s a typically slow-moving bureaucracy. I’ve long since given up expecting such agencies to ever become more efficient. For instance, the New York Times editorial board suggests providing the overburdened agency with additional resources and longer time frames for patent examiners. Count me as skeptical, but the Times did offer one useful solution : improving the process for challenging dubious patents via the Patent Trial and Appeal Board: “Bad patents have steep costs. They gum up the wheels of innovation by making it harder for would-be inventors to proceed with their work.… And they leave honest inventors vulnerable to patent trolls.” But it can take years and steep legal costs to challenge them. Specific reforms are complex, but it’s worth considering a process that, per the Times , makes “it easier to challenge bad patents before they are granted.” Reforms should also look at ways to make it easier to weed out bad patents that should not have been granted in the first place. It will be a long process to reforming the system, but here’s a good opportunity for some bipartisan attention. At the very least, this issue ought to garner more consideration the next time pharmaceutical-pricing concerns push Congress in a price-control direction. None of this requires deep philosophical debates about the value of patents. We’ll leave those for libertarian confabs. The rest of us should look at ways of fixing the current system, as we try to reduce prices for drugs and other necessities by enhancing free-market competition.

"1","Z akiya Carr Johnson hates the American system. She hates American culture. So Secretary of State Antony Blinken thought, Perfect! Let’s hand her a top role at the State Department! That is indeed exactly what happened. Zakiya Carr Johnson, who has said that the United States is a “failed historical model” and that our culture is “deeply rooted in patriarchy, in colonialism, in racism,” has now been named the State Department’s new “chief diversity and inclusion officer.” Prior to being named to the role, Carr Johnson served as the director of the State Department’s “Race, Ethnicity, and Social Inclusion Unit” during the Obama administration and co-founded an identitarian progressive activist group, Black Women Disrupt. When Blinken announced her appointment last week, he effusively praised her , saying that her “commitment to inclusive leadership” would make the State Department “stronger, smarter, and more innovative.” The chances of that happening are slim. Carr Johnson’s extensive track record of radical anticolonialism suggests that she will seek to undermine the United States’ efforts to advance its interests abroad. Based on Blinken’s description of the role, her position at the State Department will be pivotal, making her impact all the worse. When Blinken announced the creation of the position in 2021, he said that the chief diversity officer would “hold senior leadership accountable” and that the officeholder would report directly to him. Carr Johnson is adamant that dismantling “colonialism” is one of her life’s central objectives. In a 2020 webinar, she was insistent that “traditional structure,” including “colonialism” and “patriarchy,” needs to be dismantled: “[W]e’ve literally got to be about dismantling that traditional structure at every juncture,” she said. She also stated in that webinar that feminist leaders should be critical of “traditional systems,” “how we’ve always done things,” and “power dynamics and how we use power.” This is often difficult, she stated, because work environments are “laden with traditions that already carry power dynamics, be they from histories of colonialism or patriarchy or misogyny.” In a 2020 action plan for the organization Fair Share of Women Leaders, she wrote , “I do not believe that the way we construct solutions to the most pressing issues we are facing in this world should model a colonizer’s map of how to do things.” Additionally, she has argued that “time has run out” on efforts to “tweak[]” our “failed historical model” and that the only option is total dismantling. “[T]he rules created in our organizations and baked into their very foundations are often riddled with racism, patriarchy and exclusion,” she explained. “These are chinks in the armor of traditional leadership that refuse to reconcile with a colonizing past, or recognize that time has run out for experimentation and tweaking of a failed historic model.” When Carr Johnson assumes her new job at the State Department this week, there are a number of means through which she could implement her radical anticolonial agenda. One approach would be to undermine the State Department’s efforts to support Israel given that the brand of radical anticolonialism that she professes views Israel as a “settler colonial state.” She has connected herself to people who hold such views, as in 2021 when she appeared on Marc Lamont Hill’s show. The TV host was fired by CNN in 2018 after he called for “a free Palestine from river to sea” at a U.N. event. Carr Johnson could also oppose the State Department’s efforts to promote American values overseas given that she regards our system as a “failed historic model” and our culture as deeply misogynistic and racist. She could do this by seeking the removal of U.S. military bases in former colonies; lobbying against programs like Radio Free Europe and Voice of America; opposing the growth of programs that promote freedom of the press or freedom of religion; arguing against our strong economic and political ties with former colonies that some anticolonial activists view as a form of soft imperialism; or advocating for permitting other nations to commit abuses under the justification that American values are not universal. In her capacity overseeing personnel at the State Department, Carr Johnson is likely to inject the most radical forms of the “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” agenda. In the past, Carr Johnson has expressed her convictions that “feminist leadership” should be “anti-racist”; “White-centered feminism trends and narratives” should be countered; and “intersectionality” should be present “in all spaces.” Carr Johnson will be undeterred by any backlash she will face for seeking the total dismantling of American traditions, values, and ways of operating. “[D]espite the tension and discomfort that may come from questioning the way things have always been,” she wrote in 2019, “we must critically explore privilege, power and process to chart new ways forward.” For Johnson, tradition and accumulated wisdom are just excuses for those who are refusing to transform society. “‘It’s the way we have always done things’ is no longer an acceptable excuse,” she wrote. “We understand that a cultural shift is on the horizon and in order to save us all, we must be prepared to change.” It is a major concern when a radical DEI activist wins a position at a corporation. But it is far more alarming when a radical who is ideologically opposed to the American system and who views its global influence as a form of colonialism becomes a top figure at the State Department. Before Carr Johnson is able to act, she needs to be removed. The taxpayers should not be funding the deliberate destruction of our efforts to promote American interests abroad."
"2","“This is a struggle between the children of light and the children of darkness, between humanity and the law of the jungle,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech last October, days into the Israel-Hamas war . Netanyahu has voiced that idea repeatedly, both before and after the Hamas attack on October 7 — the idea that Israel is a bastion of Western civilization in an uncivilized, backward, and barbarous region. His mention of “the jungle” recalls a popular Israeli expression, attributed to former Prime Minister Ehud Barak three decades ago, that Israel is “a villa in the jungle.” The jungle, in this case, is the Arab world, and the Palestinians in it are the “ beasts ” par excellence. But the idea goes back even further, to the early Zionist thinkers. Theodor Herzl, the Austro-Hungarian father of modern Zionism, wanted to establish a state where Jews could be safe from the violent antisemitism they’d long faced in Europe. He painted a vision of a Jewish state in Palestine that would grant civil rights to the Arabs who remained there (in his diary, he toyed with the idea of transferring some outside the borders). He argued that by bringing Western civilization to the region, Jews would be benefiting the local Arabs economically and culturally — and that the Jewish state would “constitute part of the wall of defense against Asia; we would serve as an outpost of civilization against barbarism.” This “outpost of civilization” ideology is key to understanding how Israel justified Palestinian dispossession to Israelis and to the world as Jews seeking refuge from persecution settled in Palestine in the 19th and 20th centuries. When Israel was founded in 1948, more than 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or forced to flee their homes in what is now the Jewish state. But from the early days of the state, there was a group that didn’t buy the justification: Jews with roots in the Arab and Muslim world. Called Mizrahim in Israel, these Jews today make up the largest ethnic group in the country. They mostly immigrated to Israel after 1948, and for much of the country’s history, they’ve been victims of the same kind of anti-Arab ideology that is wielded against the Palestinians. For centuries, Mizrahi Jews had enjoyed high status in their countries of origin in the Middle East and North Africa, which ranged from Iraq to Egypt to Morocco. But when they landed in Israel, they found that the new state was ruled by European Jews, called Ashkenazim, who overwhelmingly viewed them as primitive and culturally backward. Mizrahi intellectuals at the time were quick to link the discrimination against them to the discrimination against Palestinians. Orientalism — Palestinian scholar Edward Said’s term for a European tendency to portray “the East” as exotic, irrational, and uncivilized — was being used to cast both groups as inferior and deny them equal rights. Their struggle was one and the same. And so, starting in the 1950s, Mizrahim and Palestinians formed a solidarity movement, producing everything from joint magazines to joint street protests. This movement offers a counterpoint to the “villa in the jungle” view of Israel — an alternative vision for how Jews and Palestinians can live together on the land. It also offers a more nuanced way to think about contemporary debates on the meaning of indigeneity, nationhood, and colonialism in Israel-Palestine. The vision of Mizrahi-Palestinian solidarity seems even more important in light of what has actually happened in more recent decades: Mizrahim drastically moved to the political right , and solidarity with Palestinians became Israel’s road not taken. Understanding that swerve is key to understanding what went wrong in Israel’s history that made it unable to imagine coexistence with an Arab people. And it may be key to building a better future for all. Who are Mizrahi Jews? Mizrahi Jews came to Israel from the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia, often from Arab countries. (Although they’re sometimes lumped together with Sephardic Jews , with whom they share some religious customs, the term “Sephardic” technically refers to Jews from Spain and Portugal.) But before emigrating to Israel, they would not have thought of themselves as Mizrahi; that term, meaning “Eastern” or “Oriental” in Hebrew, was coined in 20th- century Israel. Most would have simply thought of themselves as “Jewish Iraqis,” say, or “Moroccan Jews,” depending on their country of origin. But some described themselves as “al-yahud al-arab,” or “Arab Jews” — and their Muslim neighbors occasionally used that term to describe them, too. Nowadays, it’s so common to hear about animosity between Jews and Arabs that many people may think the relationship was always a hostile one, and the term “Arab Jew” sounds almost like an oxymoron. But for centuries, Jews were deeply integrated into Arab society, serving as musicians, merchants, and even government ministers. They consumed and produced culture in Arabic. Their philosophy and theology was profoundly influenced by Islamic thought and vice versa. There were Arab Jews as surely as there are Arab Christians. That said, “Arab Jew” is a contested identity today. Many Jews with roots in the Arab and Muslim world, disillusioned by how that world treated Jews — particularly after Israel’s founding — prefer terms like “Mizrahi.” Still, some scholars refer to them as Arab Jews to emphasize how much they identified with Arab culture before the creation of Israel. Take my family, for example. My father’s side is from Baghdad, Iraq. A century ago, Jews like us made up one-third of Baghdad’s population. They were prominent in the Iraqi parliament and in the judicial system. They were all the rage in the music scene. In the 1920s, King Faisal I of Iraq affirmed their integral role, declaring , “There is no meaning for words like Jews, Muslims, and Christians within the concept of nationalism. This is simply a country called Iraq and all are Iraqis.” The story is similar in Morocco, where my mother’s side is from. During World War II, when the French Vichy regime tried to impose Nazi persecution in Morocco, King Mohammed V refused : “There are no Jews in Morocco,” he said. “There are only Moroccans.” There, too, Jews held top positions in government. They cultivated deep friendships with their Muslim neighbors — so deep that, when I visited Morocco and found a 90-year-old man who’d known my family 70 years ago, he got so excited that he shouted my grandfather’s name over and over with glee. The point is not that Jews were always safe under Arab or Muslim rule — they weren’t. It depended on the time, on the place, and on which empire was in power. For example, Jews experienced persecution in medieval Yemen, and in 1656 they were expelled from Isfahan, Iran. But if you were a Jew living in the vast and long-lasting Ottoman Empire, you had it relatively good. Muslim rulers viewed Jews as “People of the Book” — fellow monotheists who, though they ranked below Muslims, nevertheless were entitled to respect and protection so long as they paid a special tax. It was very unlike what was happening in Christian Europe, where Jews were blamed for everything from the death of Jesus to the bubonic plague . On the whole, in the Muslim world, Jews coexisted with their neighbors to a remarkable degree for two millennia. “It was a comfortable age in comparison to life in Europe,” said Orit Bashkin , a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of Chicago. Although there were ups and downs, “in general, the Jews in Muslim lands thrived.” Yet today, the remaining Jewish communities in the Middle East and North Africa are vanishingly small. Why did Mizrahi Jews leave Arab countries? While Middle Eastern Jewish communities survived — and often thrived — under Arab or Muslim rule for over 2,000 years, they ultimately could not survive the founding of the state of Israel. During and after World War II, hundreds of thousands of Jews fleeing genocide in Europe settled in Palestine. By 1947, amid calls for a state that would serve as a safe haven for Jews after the Holocaust, the United Nations partitioned Palestine, which at the time was controlled by the British Empire, into an Arab state and a Jewish state. But Egypt’s delegate to the UN warned at the time, “The lives of one million Jews in Muslim countries will be jeopardized by the establishment of a Jewish state.” The fear was that in the Arab world, all Jews would be seen as supporters of Zionism, and that Arab countries would turn on Jews within their borders as a result. Sadly, that’s exactly what happened. To understand why this was such a seismic moment, we have to remember that this was also a time in world history when the great world empires were being shaken up amid efforts to decolonize. Tectonic shifts were happening in political ideology — including in the Arab world, where the forces of Arab nationalism had been brewing for years. In the 1930s and 1940s, Arab countries like Iraq and Transjordan had gained independence from European powers, most notably the British. Arab nationalists in these countries pictured the whole Arab world as a single unified nation. It was a pan-Arab vision that stretched to include Palestine — where tensions were rising between Palestinians and Jews as European Jews began immigrating there in greater numbers. Even before the state of Israel was founded, this put Jews in the Arab world in a confusing position. Would Arab Jews see themselves as part of the Arab nationalist movement? Would other Arabs perceive them that way? The answer varied. Some Jews felt so much a part of Arab culture that they supported Arab nationalism — including in Palestine . “We are Arabs before we are Jews,” wrote the Iraqi Jewish educator Ezra Haddad in 1936. In 1938, a group of Iraqi Jewish professionals told the press they were “young Arab Jews” who supported an Arab Palestine. A Jewish family in Baghdad in 1912. Heritage Images/Getty Images But many of their non-Jewish neighbors perceived the Jews as supporting the British instead of supporting the Arab countries’ efforts to get out from under colonialism. A rift had opened. Then, the state of Israel was founded, and the rift turned into a gaping chasm. Now Jews in Arab countries were also suspected of supporting the removal of Palestinian Arabs from their land to make way for a Jewish state. Across the Arab world, Jews became targets of suspicion, viewed as possible spies for Israel. They were sacked from government positions, arrested, and even executed on the accusation of collaborating with Zionist activities. Anti-Jewish riots erupted . Jews’ property was confiscated, their assets frozen. In many cases, conditions became so hostile that they were effectively forced out. In other cases, Jews left the Arab world because they wanted to. Some felt a deep religious yearning to return to the Holy Land. Besides, Zionist emissaries had been active in these countries since the early 1940s, trying to inspire Jews to immigrate. In other words, there was both a push and a pull. The net result was an exodus of Middle Eastern and North African Jews to the fledgling state of Israel. What was life like for Mizrahi Jews in Israel? Although Zionist envoys had promised Mizrahim they’d find a better life in Israel, in reality, these Jews were in for a massive disappointment. It started as soon as they got off the planes. First, they were sprayed with the insecticide DDT to “disinfect” and “delouse” them . Then they were sent to live in transit camps known as ma’abarot — tent cities with no electricity, running water, or basic sanitation. Later, they were moved to poor towns known as development towns, which offered permanent housing but little infrastructure or economic opportunity. Through the 1950s, Israel struggled to build enough housing for the immigrants flooding in from both the Arab world and Europe, but European Jews were given better housing in more desirable cities. That’s because, in the eyes of the ruling Ashkenazi elite, their fellow European Jews were already civilized, while Mizrahi Jews were primitives — or, as the Mizrahi intellectual Eliyahu Eliachar put it, the “white man’s burden.” For a painful example of this attitude in action, consider what came to be known as the “ Yemenite Children Affair .” Between 1948 and 1954, somewhere between 1,500 and 5,000 Mizrahi children — mostly Yemenite children — were disappeared from Israeli hospitals, either immediately after birth or when they were taken to see a doctor for some medical problem. The parents were told that the children had died, but no proof was given. Some Mizrahi Jews believed that the babies were given to childless Ashkenazi couples. In recent years, these claims have been substantiated with the help of DNA testing. The Israeli government minister charged with investigating the affair publicly acknowledged a few years ago that the abductions did take place. Testimonials show that hospital staff kidnapped the children because of a belief that Mizrahi Jews were unfit parents with too many babies. Giving the kids to Ashkenazi couples would be doing everybody a favor, in their view — including the young state of Israel, which would get a new generation of citizens shorn of the “backward” Mizrahi influence. Yona Musa, 76, of Yemeni descent, poses with a portrait of her and her husband at her home in Israel in 2016. Musa is one of thousands of Israelis who say their babies were abducted. AFP via Getty Images It wasn’t just the old European Orientalist ideology that demanded Mizrahi Jews be “civilized” and shed their cultures. It was also a political fact that was distinctly Israeli. In the 1948 war that led to the creation of Israel — which Israelis know as the War of Independence but which Palestinians know as the Nakba , Arabic for “catastrophe” — neighboring Arab countries had attacked Israel. “Arab” became synonymous with “enemy,” and anything that threatened to blur the boundary between Jews and Arabs had to be excised. In the quest to de-Arabize the Arab Jews, Israel invented “Mizrahi” as a social category. Now these Jews would have no use for unacceptable identifiers like “Arab” or “Lebanese” or “Syrian” — they would all just be Mizrahi. (Persians, Turks, and Indians who were not Arab were also included in the umbrella category of Mizrahim because they were perceived as “Oriental” or “Eastern.”) The repulsion for all things Arab also meant that Mizrahim had to give up their mother tongue, Arabic, which had previously united them with neighbors in their countries of origin and which Israel now viewed as the language of the enemy. It was a painful rupture perhaps best captured in the words of Moroccan-Israeli author Sara Shilo: “Along came the knife of Hebrew and cut us in two.” The fascinating, little-known history of Mizrahi-Palestinian solidarity Mizrahim faced such intense discrimination that some came to see themselves as victims of Zionism and warned remaining family members back home not to emigrate to Israel. In fact, thousands of Jews from North Africa and Asia actually left Israel and returned to their former countries. In one memorable protest in 1951, Indian Jews announced a hunger strike to the death and made a single demand of Israel: “You brought us here — we want you to send us back.” Israel ended up flying them back to Bombay. Most Mizrahi Jews, however, stayed put in Israel. They did what immigrants do: They tried to assimilate. If that meant shedding their Arabness to buy social capital, so be it. But there were resisters, too. Mizrahi intellectuals analyzed Zionist ideology and argued that it grew out of 19th-century European nationalist thinking, where colonialism was seen as noble and Orientalism was de rigueur. After all, in the early 1900s, Herzl had turned to the British for support in creating a Jewish state because, as he said , “the Zionist idea, which is a colonial idea, must be understood in England easily and quickly” given that England was “the first to recognize the necessity of colonial expansion in the modern world.” Colonialism was portrayed as a way to “civilize” the world. Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, unabashedly said , “We do not want Israelis to become Arabs. We are in duty bound to fight against the spirit of the Levant, which corrupts individuals and societies.” Given this ideology, it was no surprise that Zionism would cast Arabs as uncivilized brutes — whether they were Jewish or Palestinian. The very same ideology was oppressing both groups, Mizrahi intellectuals realized. And so they formed a solidarity movement. In 1953, Arabic-speaking intellectuals created a magazine called al-Jadid, which published poetry and fiction written by Mizrahi Jews and Palestinians. The editors said they wanted to shine a light on anti- Mizrahi and anti-Arab discrimination “out of the spirit of [establishing] Arab-Jewish solidarity,” according to Bryan K. Roby’s book The Mizrahi Era of Rebellion . This solidarity extended into the streets. When Mizrahim and Palestinians joined together in grassroots protests, carrying signs that stated “Bread — Work — Peace” and “For a united and persistent struggle,” the Israeli police responded with heavy force. Even just talking to each other was risky business. As Roby documents, one officer told a Bedouin Arab who had been speaking to Mizrahim in the southern city of Beersheba, “For you it is permitted to visit the city, but it is not right for you to talk to the population.” Despite what Roby describes as “the government’s divide-and- conquer efforts to plant the seeds of mutual hatred between Palestinian and Mizrahi citizens,” Mizrahim like the Iraqi-born writer Latif Dori urged the creation of a joint socialist youth movement for Mizrahi and Palestinian teens to cement “a bridge of understanding” between the Jewish and Arab peoples. Dori wrote that “our common struggle” is the only way to create a positive future for “the two brotherly peoples” standing “hand in hand in front of the nationalist waves.” “The real original sin of the Zionist movement was the fact that, in returning to our Homeland, which is part and parcel of the Orient, we did everything we could to estrange ourselves from the Middle East in which we wanted to live,” Mizrahi intellectual Eliyahu Eliachar said in an interview in 1975. Elsewhere, he wrote, “Ultimately, the [Mizrahi] problem is closely bound up with the Arab problem: for it is only when Israel is able to acknowledge to itself that it is, among other things, an Oriental country, that Israelis will be able to prepare themselves for a constructive encounter with the Arabs.” Charlie Biton (left), head of the Israeli delegation for peace talks with senior Palestine Liberation Organization officials in Budapest, receives a hug from Latif Dori on June 14, 1987, upon his arrival in Tel Aviv. AFP via Getty Images Mizrahim in those days also felt an affinity with another oppressed group: African Americans. The Ashkenazim for whom they did menial labor often derogatorily referred to Mizrahim as “shvartse khaye,” or black animals. So they reclaimed their “blackness” and found inspiration in the US civil rights struggle. So much so that by the 1970s, Mizrahim had formed the Israeli Black Panther movement to fight for social justice. Despite then-Prime Minister Golda Meir famously complaining that “they are not nice people,” the Panthers got the government to shift resources toward Mizrahi communities to fight poverty and inadequate housing, at least for a time. Panther leader Charlie Biton — who named his daughter Angela after political activist Angela Davis — met with members of the Palestinian Liberation Organization to rally together those victimized by Israeli policies. Colonialism, indigeneity, and nationhood — from a Mizrahi perspective Yet for many Mizrahim, the goal was not to fight the idea of a Jewish homeland per se but to fight Ashkenazi Zionism, which they saw as intrinsically colonial and racist. They recognized that there’s a difference between migrating and colonizing, and they had no problem with Jews returning to live on their ancestral land so long as they did not dispossess or exploit the Palestinians who already lived there. This view stood in stark contrast to an early Zionist slogan that described Palestine before Jewish settlement as “a land without a people for a people without a land.” It’s worth taking a moment to understand what that slogan really means. It’s not that early Zionists literally thought Palestine was an uninhabited desert — when Herzl visited, he saw the local Arabs with his own eyes and called them “the indigenous population.” In fact, European Jews who settled in the land in the early 1900s romanticized the locals as emblems of native authenticity, to the point that it was trendy for young Zionists to dress in Bedouin shepherd garb and sprinkle their Hebrew with Arabic phrases. As one later wrote , “we were dying to be like them … to talk like them, to walk like them, we imitated them in everything … We regarded them as the model of the native.” Clearly, there were already people on this land. But in the view of many early Zionists, there wasn’t a people. Herzl called them “a mixed multitude,” a hodgepodge of different populations rather than one coherent ethnic group. According to the 19th-century European logic of nation-state building, only a unified nation could stake a nationalist claim, so the local Arabs’ heterogeneity invalidated any rights to the land that they might have on the basis of their indigeneity. Ashkenazi Zionists were happy to view Arabs as romantic ideals while they lacked power but would reconstruct them as the “other” when they became too much of a threat by opposing Jewish statehood in Palestine. So it was that Zionists went from cosplaying as Arabs before the founding of Israel to discriminating against them afterwards. A Zionist guard in Bedouin shepherd garb protecting a small settlement in Palestine in the early 1900s. Universal Images Group via Getty Images Meanwhile, the Ashkenazi Zionist movement was trying to produce a unified Jewish people in order to stake a nationalist claim. To achieve that, it had to strip Mizrahim of any markers of Arab identity, which challenged the picture of unity. Yet this paradoxically showed that peoplehood was not a fixed essence but a manufactured construct, with pieces that could be removed at will. Indigeneity and nationhood were socially constructed categories , constantly shifting depending on the political needs of the day. Mizrahi intellectuals refused to lift up Jewishness while denigrating Arabness. Instead of agreeing to a form of Zionism that would build a nation-state with one nation at the top, they pushed for a reformulation that would grant equal rights to all inhabitants of the land. The only route to that kind of a universalist vision would be to give up Herzl’s idea that Jews were there to be “an outpost of civilization against barbarism.” But by the 1970s, historical events had narrowed the space for imagining a version of Israel that could offer everyone equal rights. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan, Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from Syria, massively expanding the territory under its control. Roughly 300,000 Palestinians were displaced from the newly occupied territories, and millions came under Israeli military occupation . Though Israel later gave back Sinai, it maintained varying degrees of power over the other areas. Can Jewish-Palestinian solidarity be more than a romantic vision today? You might expect, based on their history, that Mizrahi Jews would be associated with the Israeli left today. Yet that’s not the case: Many Mizrahim are now right-wing . In fact, it’s impossible to understand Israel’s lurch to the right and the rise of the hawkish Likud party without understanding the trajectory of the Mizrahim. So, what happened? For starters, the experience of being kicked out of Arab countries post-1948 naturally soured many Jews’ feelings toward the Arab world. Plus, from the moment they arrived in Israel, the experience of discrimination taught Mizrahim that gaining social status was contingent on rejecting Arabness. And what better way to reject it than to become the most nationalist and the most anti-Arab of all? As Smadar Lavie , a Mizrahi anthropologist and author of Wrapped in the Flag of Israel , put it to me, “If your only choice is to wag your racial purity — you need to prove that you’re a good Jew, which means you’re a nationalist Jew — then that’s what you’ll do.” But there was another factor at play. For the first three decades of Israel’s existence, it was ruled by the Labor Party, which was rooted in both socialism and Ashkenazi Zionism. In practice, that meant building up leftist institutions like the kibbutz — a kind of utopian agricultural commune that stretches back to Zionism’s early days — even while pushing Palestinians off their land and discriminating against Mizrahim (who were more likely to be hired as cheap laborers on a kibbutz than to gain membership in it). This was the version of “leftism” that Mizrahim encountered. For many, continuing to support the Labor Party when it represented the Ashkenazi Zionists who oppressed them was an extremely unappealing prospect. Meanwhile, the Israeli right, which favored an even more hardline approach toward the Palestinians, strategically used the left’s discrimination against Mizrahim to its own advantage. From the 1950s to the 1970s, it invested in courting Mizrahim by promising them concrete benefits and upward mobility. This culminated in a historic election upset in 1977, when Mizrahim helped unseat the governing Labor Party by voting for the right-wing Likud Party led by Menachem Begin. As Mizrahim formed an attachment to Likud, they adopted some of its political views. Today, Netanyahu, who opposes the idea of a Palestinian state and has presided over the mushrooming of Israeli settlements that undercut the viability of creating one, leads Likud. Mizrahim — who remain economically disadvantaged compared to Ashkenazim — are a crucial part of his base . Of course, there are some left-wing Mizrahim. They’ve tried to join forces with the Israeli left, which is today Ashkenazi-dominated. But many told me that they’ve come away alienated, feeling Ashkenazim ignore the issues that matter to them — like poverty and housing inequality, which are the legacy of racial discrimination within Israel. “I really wanted to be part of the peace movement. But I’m not sure the peace movement wanted me,” said Sapir Sluzker- Amran, one of several Mizrahi activists I spoke to who said they’ve felt marginalized, patronized, or tokenized by the left. These Mizrahim have periodically tried to reboot the old vision of solidarity with Palestinians by founding their own groups, like the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition in the 1990s, Breaking Walls in 2019, and the Mizrahi Civic Collective in 2023. Netta Amar-Shiff, a Mizrahi human rights lawyer who helps lead that last group, insists that Israelis’ future is bound up with Palestinians’ future, as the prolonged conflict puts both populations in danger. “I know that if Palestinians are not safe, I won’t be safe. It’s either mutually assured destruction or mutually assured salvation,” she said, sounding a lot like the intellectuals of the 1950s. Yet now, as then, these Mizrahi bridge-building groups are starved for resources. “There is always a minority that keeps the solidarity alive,” Orit Bashkin told me. “But right now, with very minor exceptions, this solidarity is more or less dead.” Since Mizrahim make up the largest share of Jews in Israel, that bodes poorly for Israel’s prospects for peace. And it’s not just Mizrahim — over the years, the Israeli public as a whole has been moving to the right . A few years ago, Sluzker-Amran created a public archive that houses materials related to Mizrahi history, from protest flyers to the writings of bygone intellectuals. She wants people to have a true reckoning with the Mizrahi experience. That experience reveals the particular aspects of Ashkenazi Zionist ideology that made Israel unable to imagine coexistence with an Arab people. Like a three-sided prism that refracts the light anew, looking at Israel through the triangulated history of Palestinians, Ashkenazim, and Mizrahim allows us to see the problem properly illuminated so we can grope our way toward a solution. “We always wanted to have the chance to build a movement that pursues justice for all communities — the Palestinians would be a big part of that,” Sluzker-Amran said. “But we’ve never had a chance to really do that experiment. I feel like we’re always sitting in the archive.” She hopes more people come to see the Mizrahi vision of solidarity like she does: as a grand experiment just waiting to be tried.

"2","On TikTok , a dispute is brewing over the bona fides of hip-hop’s latest viral sensation. Twenty-two-year-old singer 4Batz, whose real name is Neko Bennett, rose to prominence as an independent artist in 2023 with only two (now three) streamable songs to his name. One of them, “ Act II: Date @ 8 ,” earned a feature from rap superstar Drake , who signed 4Batz to his record label OVO Sound earlier this month. So far, he’s earned cosigns from Kanye West and SZA ; on Spotify , he’s accumulated an impressive 10 million monthly listeners. 4Batz’s blink-and-you-missed-it ascent immediately raised doubts about the legitimacy of his come-up. Did the baby-voiced crooner ever have a certifiable career as an independent artist, or was he plucked out of thin air by some crafty music executives with a preconceived plan to launch their next big star? In other words, is 4Batz an “industry plant?” A slew of commentators on TikTok seem to think so based on Drake’s quick cosign. One TikToker, @MediaMayhem , argues that 4Batz has simply benefitted from “good marketing,” namely his presence on the popular YouTube rap series From the Block . Others point to the quality of his Spotify-core, trap sound as proof that his popularity must be largely manufactured. (On the flipside, one TikToker argued that he isn’t a “traditional” industry plant because his songs are actually good.) Writer Mankaprr Conteh also questioned whether the speediness of 4Batz’s rise even matters if his music is clearly resonating with listeners. 4Batz is far from the first artist to have his pathway to fame questioned. Multi-instrumentalist Jon Batiste’s recent entry into the awards space has raised eyebrows. Billie Eilish , another awards magnet, has dealt with the same suspicions that her stardom is inorganic. In recent years, the pejorative “industry plant” has been employed with fervor among music fans much like the term “ nepo baby ” has been in acting. (In the case of certain well-connected, blossoming stars like Maya Hawke, the singer-actor daughter of Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke, these conversations have overlapped.) Unlike nepo baby discourse, though, there seems to be less of a unified understanding of what an industry plant actually is. As a result, it’s a term being thrown at every artist you can think of, even longtime industry mainstays like Taylor Swift and Kanye West . A brief history of the “industry plant” Music journalists began noticing the term “industry plant” on hip-hop message boards in the early 2010s. In one thread on the forum KanyeToThe from 2012, users accused a variety of rappers — including 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, Trinidad James, Drake, and Meek Mill — of being industry plants based on their supposed connections and how they were discovered. Pitchfork writer Alphonse Pierre, who reviews rap music, says that this phenomenon occurs when artists seem to blow up suddenly. This conversation often crops up in the hip-hop scene, where someone’s authenticity and pre-fame hustle are an important part of a rapper’s identity. @adamtheflop Reply to @glitterspaceship here is an analysis and my thoughts on if she’s a plant. Lmk who I should do next :) ♬ Violin - Grooving Gecko “This happens a lot in rap these days where new artists show up overnight all the time and already famous artists are racing to be attached to the hype train,” he says. Interestingly, these are the circumstances surrounding the early and latter parts of Drake’s career . When he arrived on the rap scene in the mid-2000s, following his time as an actor on the Canadian teen drama Degrassi , he was labeled an industry plant by hip-hop fans. Now, in his late 30s, he’s attaching himself to newer artists — like 4Batz — helping them earn the pejorative title he once had. More recently though, as social media and streaming have taken over, this label has been increasingly tacked onto artists occupying nearly every popular genre of music. From indie-rock acts like Phoebe Bridgers and Wet Leg to mainstream pop singers like Tate McRae — even unimpeachable A-listers like Taylor Swift — everyone is seemingly a record label puppet that we’ve all been brainwashed into liking. Aside from the supposed speed of an artist’s rise, there are a couple of factors that seem to increase one’s likelihood of being called an “industry plant.” Nepotism is indeed one of them. Following the virality of her 2017 song “ Pretty Girl ,” singer-songwriter Clairo was quickly labeled an industry plant when a New York Times profile revealed that her father, Geoff Cottrill, was the former chief marketing officer at Converse and helped get her a recording contract through his business connections. Gracie Abrams, daughter of Hollywood filmmaker J.J. Abrams, was also hit with these accusations when she was announced as one of the opening acts for Swift’s Eras Tour and, later, nominated for Best New Artist at this year’s Grammys . Another common signifier of “industry plant” is a perceived lack of talent. Before Lana Del Rey was lauded as a songwriting genius — this critical reappraisal happened around 2019’s Norman Fucking Rockwell — her music wasn’t necessarily received enthusiastically by critics . Her heavily mocked musical guest appearance on Saturday Night Live in 2012 highlighted what detractors felt was a lack of vocal ability and stage presence. Factor in her 1950s glamourpuss looks — a change from her previous era performing under the name Lizzy Grant — and her Cuban-inspired stage name, and naysayers deemed her the Tumblr-friendly product of some focus group test. Record label executives are supposed to seek out unknown talent — be they well-connected or not — and develop them into profitable artists Still, these industry plant accusations ignore the reality of the function of the music industry. Record label executives are supposed to seek out unknown talent — be they well-connected or not — and develop them into profitable artists. It’s the crux of their work. As Tom Taylor wrote in an article for Far Out Magazine, it’s these companies’ MO to help artists “on their journey through advice, funding, marketing, and getting them on the biggest stages that they can.” These are the backstories of legendary Motown artists like the Supremes and Marvin Gaye, who were sent to charm school to adopt a more refined, elegant presence, and Disney -bred child stars like Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and the Jonas Brothers, who were seen as products to be built into pop singers and were given in-house advertising through Radio Disney and the Disney Channel. Music fans have had a front-row seat to this sort of artistic development for several decades on music competition shows, like American Idol and The X-Factor , which produced the careers of hitmakers like Kelly Clarkson and One Direction (and inadvertently then, Harry Styles) respectively. That same talent search and training is also employed by Korean entertainment agencies launching big K-pop groups, like BTS, Twice, and Blackpink. Today’s artists are getting attention in a new, sped-up way Despite these “industry plant” discussions often taking place online, there’s a lack of literacy regarding social media’s impact on the music business. In the mid-2000s, Justin Bieber was one of the first viral internet stars to gain the attention of A-list singers and a talent manager for his YouTube covers. When he released his first studio album My World 2.0 in 2010, he became the youngest male singer to debut at No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100 in almost 50 years, demonstrating a DIY route for mega-pop stardom. Fellow Canadian Shawn Mendes is another example of an artist whose popularity on the now-defunct app Vine launched him into a new stratosphere of fame. This shift in the way artists are discovered is even more visible in hip-hop, following the invasion of SoundCloud rappers in the 2010s. The free streaming platform allowed young rhymers like Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Pump, Post Malone, and the late Juice WRLD to bypass old methods of crafting mixtapes and selling CDs out of cars. Korean pop group BTS at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards at Staples Center on January 26, 2020, in Los Angeles, California. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic Streaming platforms, like Spotify and Apple Music, have also changed the way artists are promoted by record labels and discovered by consumers. This has become a genuine gripe among people who make music and feel the industry is screwing them over. One major point of contention in this regard is Spotify’s “Discovery Mode” tool, which allows artists to increase their likelihood of exposure on the app while accepting lower royalties. In 2021, musicians and songwriters from the Artists Rights Alliance penned a Rolling Stone op-ed , calling the “Discovery Mode” initiative a “pay-for-play scheme,” facilitating a “race to the bottom” for aspiring musicians. These concerns are reminiscent of the complaints that led to the regulation of radio payola by the Federal Communications Commission in 1934. “Conventional, or radio payola, refers to paying off a DJ to play a song during their set,” Kristelia García , a Georgetown University Law Center professor, tells Vox . This trend persisted long after Congress got involved — the Communications Act didn’t ban payola but required that radio stations disclose their payments. For instance, another payola scandal arose in the 1980s when record labels found a loophole to this legislation and began utilizing independent promoters to “lavish extravagant gifts upon their DJ ‘friends’ with impunity.” “The idea was to get exposure for the song in hopes that the audience would hear it, like it, and then go out and buy the album, tickets to the show, a T-shirt, etc.,” Garcia explains. There’s a lack of literacy regarding social media’s impact on the music business In the streaming age, this exposure technique has evolved where artists can “pay off a playlister to slot a song in a playlist,” she explains, or pay for an advertisement through Spotify’s Ad studio. “A-listers have marketing departments, and developing and indie musicians have streaming payola, among other options,” says García. Regardless, concerns about this marketing process and the inequalities that may arise don’t totally explain why everyone is concerned about “industry plants.” Everyone is skeptical of everything right now The continued prevalence of the industry-plant conversation is a symptom of a larger trend online right now: compulsive skepticism. Post-pandemic, it’s hard not to notice users becoming more openly conspiracy-minded, questioning the legitimacy of everything from natural disasters to public health guidelines to celebrity couplings . This problem is also represented in the overwhelming number of online sleuths attempting to uncover the “truth” behind major news stories, whether it be the brief disappearance of a British royal from public life or a young woman’s murder . In extreme cases, this rush to speculate can have troubling outcomes. In a 2023 New Statesman article, Sarah Manavis described the alarming rise of armchair detectives spreading false information about active missing persons cases. Adam M. Enders , an associate professor at the University of Louisville’s political science department, says the public’s embrace of conspiracy theories isn’t new, but it’s become a “more salient talking point” in the media recently. “There is more discussion of conspiracy theories, but not necessarily more conspiracy theorizing,” he says. “They might be able to travel farther and faster than during the pre-internet days. However, there is no evidence that more people believe in conspiracy theories today than they did decades ago.” The industry-plant conversation is a symptom of a larger trend online right now: compulsive skepticism Enders coauthored the 2023 study “The Relationship Between Social Media Use and Beliefs in Conspiracy Theories and Misinformation,” which found that a person’s interest in conspiracy theories is based on a number of social factors and doesn’t exactly coincide with exposure alone. “Users selectively expose themselves to like-minded content online,” he says. “If one is interested in conspiratorial explanations for salient events, they’re likely to spend time online looking for material that supports that way of thinking.” This behavior has, not surprisingly, bled into celebrity culture . Not only is this demonstrated in the undying industry-plant debate, but in the current response to Hollywood gossip. Vox’s Rebecca Jennings wrote about the number of TikTokers dissecting and debunking reports surrounding the divorce of singer Joe Jonas and actor Sophia Turner last year. Through social media and reality TV , the celebrity PR machine has become noticeably more transparent, leading the average tabloid consumer to become more savvy. Still, as Jennings writes, this skepticism pervading the internet “extends far beyond critical thinking.” Elena Broda , a doctoral student at the University of Gothenburg and a researcher for the Knowledge Resistance Project , notes that public figures play a key role in “ordinarily marginalized conspiracist worldviews” entering “mainstream” discourse. “Conspiracy theories emerge as attempts to explain important sociopolitical events by alleging some sort of secret operation by powerful elites,” she says. “It is a means to understand and regain control over one’s environment. As such, celebrities may be perceived as part of ‘the elite,’ which makes them likely subjects for conspiracy theories.” Enders, more or less, agrees, citing the conspiracies around the NFL’s supposed involvement with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s relationship and Kate Middleton’s health . “Whenever a salient event occurs, especially one involving visible political or cultural figures, conspiracy theories are likely to follow,” he says. By all accounts, it seems like speculating about people and things in pop culture has become the internet’s most popular sport — but to what end? In most cases, though, users simply don’t agree with an artist’s popularity in relation to what they believe to be lacking talent or skill. When it comes to so-called industry plants, particularly singers who benefit from nepotism, it seems like many users are hinting at a larger conversation about privilege, and how it can propel a career into motion. Still, these industry plant arguments rarely produce any real conclusions or judgments about the music industry, but more often than not, the debate about industry plants serves as a reminder that the music industry is just that — an industry. In an attempt to contend with the feeling of being sold to, listeners retaliate in the ways they can. As Alphonso Pierre puts it, it might just be a new method of hating. “It’s a pretty good and lasting way to shit on an artist you don’t like without having to actually explain anything,” he says. “That’s what the internet is all about.” Will you support Vox today?

"2","The attacks on legal abortion in the last two weeks alone have been staggering. Since the beginning of April, state Supreme Courts in Florida and Arizona have both issued rulings that will effectively ban abortion care in the third and 14th most populous states. While both states already had curtailed abortion after the overturn of Roe v. Wade , now Florida’s Supreme Court ruling will trigger a six-week ban (before many people know they’re pregnant) beginning on May 1. And Arizona’s Supreme Court revived a near-total ban that will take effect in two weeks and carries with it a minimum two-year prison sentence for doctors who perform abortions that are not essential for saving their patient’s life. It’s perhaps fitting that these extreme rulings would come down at the same time that former President Donald Trump attempts to wipe his hands clean of abortion policy in his 2024 presidential campaign. Earlier this week Trump released a four-minute video saying he was “proudly the person responsible” for ending Roe v. Wade , but that he now supports states determining abortion policy “by vote or legislation or perhaps both.” Trump insisted that “at the end of the day it’s all about the will of the people.” Except that’s clearly not true. The American people never supported overturning Roe v. Wade . Abortion policy in the US has been clearly out of step with the will of the people over the last two years, and the judicial system has helped keep it that way. This week’s abortion rulings were not unpredictable The new rulings in Florida and Arizona are only the latest examples of how access to reproductive freedom continues to be restricted by far-right judges appointed by Republicans. In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed five out of seven justices to the state’s Supreme Court (and 115 judges in total ) while all seven justices in Arizona were also appointed by Republican governors. vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Subscribe Let’s not forget the Alabama state Supreme Court decision in February that invoked God to claim that frozen embryos count as “children” under state law. This “fetal personhood” ideology is being promoted by other judges too, like in Florida, where the state’s Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz recently suggested that abortion “take[s] a whole class of human beings and put[s] them outside the protection of the law.” Six of the seven Florida justices signaled they’d be open to a future fetal personhood case there. (Republican politicians have sought recently to distance themselves from court attacks on IVF and abortion, but over 120 House Republicans are currently co-sponsoring federal legislation to give constitutional rights to embryos.) These are state-level decisions, the result of state GOP politicians’ appointments. But judges on the federal bench have also used their positions to restrict abortion rights. Trump’s appointment of Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to a federal district court in Texas, for example, led to the brazen effort to restrict medication abortion nationwide. Two more Trump-appointed judges on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled in favor of restricting access to the abortion pill . As Slow Boring writer and Vox co-founder Matt Yglesias recently wrote , one of the biggest risks to abortion rights should Donald Trump win in November is that the judiciary will move even further to the right. Trump may say he’d let the states decide, but the judges he’d likely appoint wouldn’t — and there would be no recourse, as Yglesias wrote: “The whole point of the federal judiciary in the United States is that judges are insulated from electoral accountability and free to hand down whatever kind of nutty rulings they want.” Slate writers Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern made a similar point this week , observing how anti- abortion lawyers plan to use the Comstock Act , an 1873 law that hasn’t been enforced in nearly a century, to ban medication abortion nationwide. Far-right judges, they note, can help make that possible by greenlighting legally absurd interpretations. “[Anti-abortion lawyers] tell us that they intend to stay quiet about this [Comstock] scheme until after the election,” Lithwick and Stern write. “The plot is similar to what just happened in Arizona: Republicans enacted a seemingly moderate 15-week ban, only to stand by and watch as their colleagues on a GOP-packed court resuscitated a total ban passed during the Civil War.” Protesters support abortion rights in a July 2022 rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. John Parra/Getty Images for MoveOn Voters have a chance to fight back — somewhat Voters in Florida and Arizona both will likely have the chance to vote to protect abortion rights this fall. Florida’s ballot measure , which would require (a pretty formidable) 60 percent of voters to pass, would protect abortion access up to 24 weeks. Arizona’s ballot measure , which is not yet formally on the November ballot, would also protect abortion up to 24 weeks but would only require a simple majority to pass. These will be expensive, competitive fights — even as we know voters in these states support access to legal abortion. More than two- thirds of Floridians say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and in Arizona, 59 percent of registered voters say abortion should be mostly or always legal. This doesn’t mean all those people will turn out to vote, though. Even if these ballot measures do pass, there is no guarantee the “will of the people” will be respected. In Ohio, for example, after 57 percent of voters cast ballots in 2023 to protect abortion rights, Republican lawmakers immediately started plotting ways to undermine the results, including by threatening to place another referendum on the ballot in the future. More broadly, though, state protections can only go so far. Even if Florida voters were to protect abortion access, pregnant women in Texas would still have to fear dying of sepsis, or Alabama families might still have to pay much higher costs for fertility treatments. Americans want federal standards for reproductive rights , not a patchwork of state laws that leave people vulnerable.

"2","The Environmental Protection Agency has set the country’s first federal limits on forms of PFAS in drinking water, a class of “forever chemicals” that have been tied to negative health outcomes and have been found in one form or another in nearly half of the US’s tap water supply . The policy could help improve the water quality of as many as 100 million people. Having a standardized federal policy will eventually take the pressure of monitoring drinking water off of individuals, who currently have to do so in most states. The proposal, however, falls short of calling for companies that have utilized PFAS heavily — like DuPont and 3M — to curb their usage or cover cleanup costs, a move that experts say is needed to fully address the problem of these contaminants. “The issue and the cost and the burden of all this shouldn’t fall on communities, it shouldn’t fall on the consumer. It’s the polluter that needs to pay,” Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, told Vox last year. Instead, the EPA’s new rule — which is the first new standard for a contaminant in drinking water in almost three decades — will require utilities to test for and reduce the levels of some forms of PFAS to four parts per trillion. All told, the policy covers six forms of these forever chemicals, and can be enforced by the EPA if the necessary thresholds aren’t met. It will take full effect in 2029, giving utilities both time to test water quality and to make equipment changes needed to improve it. In the meantime, there are things individuals can do to reduce their exposure to the chemicals: First, they can check with their public utility about whether there has been PFAS detected in their area. (If they use a private well, they can get it tested.) And if PFAS has been found in their water supply, they can utilize filtration systems to screen it out. “The first step is the education piece of it, finding out if there is PFAS in your water,” Stoiber said. “A lot of these filters are quite effective at removing PFAS. And that’s a step that people can take.” What are PFAS, why are they bad, and are they in my water? PFAS, which is short for per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, are chemicals that repel oil and water, and that take a very long time to break down (which is why they’re commonly referred to as forever chemicals). Exposure to PFAS, which is found in everything from nonstick pans to firefighting foam to outdoor gear, has also been linked with certain medical conditions, including cancers, hypertension during pregnancy, and weakened immune systems in children. A 2023 report from the US Geological Service examined tap water over the course of five years at 716 locations including people’s homes and offices. It screened for 32 individual PFAS compounds, and found the highest concentrations of these chemicals in urban areas and specific regions including the Great Plains, Great Lakes, Eastern Seaboard, and Central and Southern California. These higher concentrations are likely tied to the prevalence of PFAS around production facilities and other sources such as landfills and wastewater plants. Places with more people could also have a higher presence of PFAS because more products containing these chemicals are in regular use. PFAS has been detected in higher concentrations in certain parts of the country. USGS The release of the study follows the Environmental Protection Agency’s advisories in June 2022 , which warned that the presence of PFOA and PFOS, two of the most common forms of PFAS, could be hazardous, including at low levels. Now, the EPA’s rule specifically requires the presence of PFOA and PFOS in water to be no more than four parts per trillion. It also requires that the presence of three other chemicals — PFNA, PFHxS and GenX — to be no more than 10 parts per trillion. (Environmental experts have urged the EPA to include more PFAS, a class of chemicals that includes thousands of compounds, in the rule.) The agency estimates that 6 to 10 percent of public utilities will have to make changes to their water filtration system in response to the regulation. How to filter PFAS out of your tap water It will be five years before utilities will have to completely comply with the PFAS levels set by the EPA. Prior to those regulations going into place, however, individuals can still take steps on their own. As the 2023 USGS report noted, different types of PFAS exist in different concentrations in drinking water across the country. The first thing that anyone concerned about PFAS should do is to figure out whether it’s present in the region they live in and at what levels. “If the person has publicly supplied water, they should be able to obtain a report from their local utility. Otherwise, they also can search the tap water database from the Environmental Working Group ,” Jamie DeWitt, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Eastern Carolina University, told Vox last year when the USGS study was released. “If the person is on a private well, unless they are covered by a court order due to known contamination, they will have to send their water out for testing on their own. Many departments of public health have recommendations on where water can be sent for different types of testing.” Stoiber notes that any level of PFAS is concerning and recommends the filtration of drinking water across the board. “Really, you don’t want any level of PFAS in your water because it has been linked to harmful health effects at quite low levels,” she told Vox. There are a range of water filters that can target PFAS, but they vary in efficacy. According to a 2020 study and the experts Vox spoke with, a reverse osmosis water filter is the most effective tool for removing PFAS. That review found that these water filters — which can be installed under a kitchen sink — are over 90 percent effective at screening out these chemicals. The filters work by sifting water through a membrane that has very “tiny holes,” says Stoiber, and the PFAS molecules get trapped as a result. The downsides of reverse osmosis filtration systems are that they waste significant amounts of water and can be pricey, costing anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars . Activated carbon filters can also reduce levels of PFAS, but were found to be less effective, according to the 2020 study. These types of filters were able to remove, on average, 73 percent of PFAS contaminants, though there was more variability. They work by attracting PFAS molecules to carbon and can be used in sinks, refrigerators, and pitchers. And while they are more cost-effective, they also have to be replaced promptly, or else their efficacy declines. Standard Brita water filters use a form of carbon technology and can remove some PFAS, but aren’t built for this express purpose, so shouldn’t be counted on solely to filter out the chemicals. When it comes to PFAS, experts note that filtered water is a better option than switching exclusively to bottled water, which can be costly, wasteful, and potentially include its own contaminants. They say, too, that ingestion poses the biggest risk of PFAS exposure relative to other water uses like showering, hand-washing, and clothes washing. If you can, the best thing to do is to filter your own water if you live in a contaminated area. “Bottled water is known to have high concentrations of PFAS. There was a case in Massachusetts a couple of years ago where bottled water had very high concentrations of PFAS in it because it was sourced from PFAS-contaminated water,” Harvard environmental chemist Elsie Sunderland previously told Vox’s Benji Jones. “So I think you’re better off drinking filtered water from a known source.” Update, April 11, 10:14 am ET: This story, originally published July 7, 2023, has been updated once with news of the EPA’s new regulation.

"2","The news of O.J. Simpson’s death — of cancer at the age of 76 — falls uneasily. O.J. Simpson is an uneasy figure. Thinking of him, you think of the power and glamour of his rise to stardom; you think of the horror of the crimes of which he was later accused and, controversially, acquitted. The story has made him an American archetype. Around Simpson, our fraught and confused feelings about race, gender, celebrity, and spectacle swirl into a vexed storm. He is the point in time and space where all our sins meet. For a time, Simpson was one of the most beloved men in America, a charismatic sports hero whose abilities on the playing field in the 1960s and ’70s seemed supernatural. The whole country appeared to be in awe of what he could accomplish: the Heisman in 1968, NFL MVP in 1973. He was so famous that his celebrity seemed to transcend America’s racism, to the point that when he was said to have declared, “I’m not Black — I’m O.J.!” it felt like he was recognizing something true about the way people saw him. (For the record, Simpson said the line was taken out of context. ) After Simpson retired from the NFL in 1979, he parlayed his celebrity into a new career in acting and broadcasting that seemed set to carry him smoothly into old age as a living legend. The good kind of legend, not the bad kind. He was the likable guy selling Hertz rental cars, the goofy cop in the Naked Gun movies . He was the kind of famous that means you more or less live in people’s living rooms and on their TV screens. People feel like they know you when you’re that kind of famous, and they love you, too. Yet even at the height of his fame, there were shadows in Simpson’s personal life. He was brutal to his wife, the model Nicole Brown, who called the police on at least nine different occasions to report Simpson for domestic violence. When the police reported to the Simpson house after one call in 1989 , they found Brown hiding in the bushes outside their home, half-dressed and severely bruised. “He’s going to kill me! He’s going to kill me!” she yelled to the police as they arrived. After that 1989 incident, Simpson was finally arrested. He pleaded no contest to a charge of spousal abuse and received a sentence of 120 hours of community service and two years’ probation. After the sentencing, the Simpsons released a joint statement saying, “Our marriage is as strong as the day we were married, if not stronger.” Later, the Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti would describe Simpson’s sentencing as “a joke, a terrible joke,” implying that Simpson received special treatment from the judge because of his celebrity. Simpson’s celebrity protected his reputation as well. His popularity did not falter, no matter how he treated Brown. In the years following his 1989 arrest, he appeared in two Naked Gun sequels, and both were box office successes. In 1992, Brown filed for divorce from Simpson, citing irreconcilable differences. On June 12, 1994, Brown was found murdered in her home , along with her friend Ron Goldman. Simpson maintained his innocence, but he also fled the police in an infamous low-speed highway chase in his white Bronco that was broadcast live across America. In 1995, the case went to trial, where it became immortalized as “the trial of the century.” The trial of O.J. Simpson has become an American myth The trial of the century was a lightning rod for sociopolitical commentary. Feminists argued that it was a matter of public record that Simpson had stalked and beaten his ex-wife, and that if law enforcement had taken the problem seriously and made the proper interventions, Brown would still be alive. Simpson’s lawyers argued that he was being unjustly targeted because the police could not stand to see a Black man be successful, and they wanted to tear him down. The argument was potent enough that support for Simpson fell strongly along racial lines. A Los Angeles Times poll found that Black people were more than four times more likely than white people to think Simpson was not guilty. In October of 1995, Simpson was acquitted of the murders. The families of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown promptly filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson for wrongful death and battery, and in 1997, Simpson was found legally liable for their deaths. In a symbolic moment, Simpson auctioned off some of the memorabilia from his football glory years — including his college Heisman Trophy — to pay the damages he owed. Simpson’s celebrity was, perhaps, able to protect him from a guilty sentence in criminal court. Yet the act of cashing in his social capital in such a way seems to have transformed fame into infamy. There was a kind of hole in the fabric of American culture where a hero used to be, and it was hard to know what stood in its place now. After the long run of trials, Simpson was no longer the kind of figure that rental car companies wanted promoting their product. He had lived off his reputation for a long time, and now that reputation had changed. Simpson attempted to cash in his new image all the same. In 2006, he announced he was publishing a “hypothetical” account of the murders and their aftermath, to be titled If I Did It. The book was canceled after overwhelming public outcry , and a judge transferred the rights to the family of Ron Goldman. The Goldmans eventually published the book with additional commentary and the new subtitle Confessions of the Killer . In 2007, Simpson was arrested and eventually sentenced to at least nine years of prison time for an armed robbery in a Las Vegas casino. In 2017 he was released on parole , and he lived the last seven years of his life a free man. By then, however, the story of the trial of the century had reached a new generation . In 2016, it was adapted into The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story . Just a few months later came the documentary O.J.: Made in America . Both were massive critical hits celebrated for their ability to bring out the political undercurrents that made the Simpson case so fascinating to Americans to begin with: the way it seemed to pit racism against misogyny against money against star power and see which carried the most weight. The story of O.J. Simpson has become an American morality tale, a myth. It is the story of how all our national sins converged into a single terrible crime. Even after the man at the center is gone, the sins persist. Will you support Vox today? We believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.

"1","Harvard University has now shown that there is a limit to how much it will compromise its reputation in pursuit of racial obsession. On Thursday, the university announced that it will reinstate its standardized testing requirement. The decision will enable Harvard to far more easily identify the students with the most talent and potential — but it will also hold the school accountable for its racial preferences. The university’s policy of foregoing standardized admissions had allowed it to sidestep scrutiny over the extent to which it discriminates against Asian and white students. Data unveiled in a lawsuit by the organization Students for Fair admissions showed that Harvard had previously given black students in the first four deciles of academic achievement a 10 times greater chance of admission than Asian and white students. Following the Supreme Court’s ruling that affirmative action violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, the university surreptitiously reaffirmed its desire to use race in admissions decisions. In a statement after the court’s ruling, Harvard noted the court’s comment that a college could consider “an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life” and said in response : “We will certainly comply with the Court’s decision.” If Harvard had continued its policy of not requiring standardized tests, the university could have more easily continued to racially discriminate without getting caught. (READ MORE from Ellie Gardey: Advocacy for Marriage as the Ideal Is Racist, Says Professor ) In announcing the new policy, Harvard Magazine drew attention to a study by two Harvard professors and a professor at Brown University that found that standardized tests are the single best metric for identifying students who will be most successful in college, particularly those who come from lower-income backgrounds. Harvard Magazine quoted one of those Harvard professors, Raj Chetty, who noted that research has shown that the other aspects of students’ college applications can be more easily manipulated with money. It is hard to imagine Harvard pointing out such a reality in 2020. At the time, decisions to pause a requirement for standardized tests coincided with the antiracist frenzy that followed the death of George Floyd. Many antiracists, such as Ibram X. Kendi, advocated for the position that standardized tests are racist because there are different outcomes, on average, across races. Kendi said in 2020, for instance, that “[s]tandardized tests have become the most effective racist weapon ever devised to objectively degrade Black and Brown minds and legally exclude their bodies from prestigious schools.” Though most universities did not make an explicit connection between antiracism and their decisions to suspend standardized test requirements — and to continue those policies years past the pandemic’s end — it was commonly understood that this was a motivator behind the decisions. For instance, the New York Times said following the University of California’s decision to eliminate standardized testing, “The change is expected to accelerate the momentum of American colleges away from the tests, amid concern that they are unfair to poor, black and Hispanic students.” Harvard’s move to reinstate standardized testing is the second sane decision the school has made this year. The first came in January when former President Claudine Gay was forced to resign in the wake of a plagiarism scandal. The decision to let her go was a defeat for “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” policies at the university given that she had been their foremost advocate. Prior to being elected Harvard’s president, Gay had made her name by spearheading the university’s efforts to implement antiracist ideology. She claimed that her goal was to address “structural inequality” and she initiated a “cluster hire in ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration.” (RELATED from Ellie Gardey: Year Begins With Major Defeat for DEI as Harvard’s Claudine Gay Resigns ) With the elimination of the test-optional testing policy — and the departure of Claudine Gay — is Harvard moving away from DEI radicalism? In one sense, yes. The most diehard advocates of antiracism are totally opposed to standardized tests. For example, the National Education Association, the largest education labor union, has said , “Since their inception a century ago, standardized tests have been instruments of racism and a biased system.” Thus, Harvard’s rejection of this position demonstrates that it is rejecting total radicalism on this issue. The university is also framing its decision to reinstate standardized testing as part of a laudable goal: identifying talented students across the socioeconomic spectrum. “In short,” said Hopi Hoekstra, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in announcing the decision, “more information, especially such strongly predictive information, is valuable for identifying talent from across the socioeconomic range.” However, given the jaw-dropping extent to which Harvard preferred certain races over others in its admissions process — a reality that was unveiled by the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard case — Harvard has a long way to go before it fully drops racism from its admissions process. In addition, Harvard maintains a huge DEI apparatus that has influence over every aspect of the university. Still, this is a major step forward. Now, we need to use Harvard’s standardized testing data to ensure that the university follows the law and does not accept and reject people on the basis of their race."
"1","Hannahs-Children-Quietly-Defying-Dearth/dp/1684514576""> Hannah’s Children: The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth By Catherine Pakaluk (Regnery, 256 pages, $30) Women are shedding the “girlboss” mindset of no man needed, no children wanted. Though the term originated with millennial businesswoman Sophia Amoruso’s 2014 memoir #GIRLBOSS, the paradigm has much deeper roots. A combination of contraception, increased access to higher education, ingrained feminism, and careerism brought family and work into increasing conflict for the American woman. The girlboss lifestyle reached its peak in the 2010s, and the glow is starting to wear off. Hardcore feminists always rejected the paradigm because it wasn’t sufficiently anti-patriarchal. But other women are reconsidering the girlboss narrative because it gives short shrift to love, marriage, and maternity. In recent years, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction, giving rise to the “tradwife” phenomenon on the right. Unlike the girlboss, the tradwife embraces an aesthetic that imitates traditional images of femininity, often hearkening back to times before the sexual revolution. The archetypal tradwife bakes bread, wears long, flowy sundresses, and takes pride in cooking a meal for her husband and children. She’s the pioneer woman with an Instagram audience. In some ways, the tradwife paradigm has gained prominence because it attempts to respond to the consumerism and isolation of modern life. The family has been under attack, both philosophically and politically, for decades. Americans are waiting longer than ever to get married — if they get married at all. On top of that, American women aren’t having enough children to sustain a stable population. Replacement rate is 2.1 births per woman, but American women had 1.64 children on average as of 2020. The tradwife trend emphasizes good things that many women desire, like marriage and family, but it is first and foremost a consumer phenomenon reliant mainly on aesthetics. Unable to survive apart from the social media ecosystem, the trend lacks a basis in anything substantial. There’s no religious component, nor is there a substantive concept of womanhood beyond what women wear and do. Without a foundation, tradwife-ism is prone to exaggeration on nearly every front. If cooking for your family is good, then churning your own butter is better. If having one child is good, then having five children is better. Now, if you asked the women interviewed in Catherine Pakaluk’s book Hannah’s Children: The Women Defying the Birth Dearth , they’d probably agree that bigger is better when it comes to family — but not because they’re part of the tradwife trend. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Though large families used to be fairly common — 20 percent of women had at least five children in 1976 — only 5 percent of women have five or more children today. The number of big families started dropping in the ’70s, but it stabilized by 1990, with the number of women with five or more children hovering around 5 percent for the past three decades. The 5 percent are, as Pakaluk notes , “strangely immune to the trend toward below- replacement fertility.” Despite their persistence as a small but consistent demographic population, these women with above-average fertility haven’t been taken seriously. Instead, they are generally regarded as outliers with little to contribute to demographic studies. As a mother of eight herself, Pakaluk wanted to illuminate the ways that women with many children make decisions regarding fertility and how they understand their motherhood. For her research, she spoke with dozens of mothers across the United States, all of whom have at least five children. Across various differences — like religion, location, level of education, and the age at which they became mothers — the women Pakaluk interviews all expressed a similar attitude toward childbearing. These mothers expressed a “deliberate rejection of an autonomous, customized, self-regarding lifestyle in favor of a way of life intentionally limited by the demands of motherhood,” she writes . Having children requires sacrifice, but these mothers chose children time and again, despite the opportunity costs. In nearly all cases, these mothers saw maternity as being intertwined with deeply held religious convictions. They spoke about their children as “eternal beings,” shared memories of turning to God in prayer to discern their readiness for another pregnancy, and viewed their motherhood as participation in a long “chain of being” connecting past, present, and future. Most strikingly, these women “adopted a posture of openness to children as a way of life and not a mere season,” Pakaluk writes . From the outside looking in, these women are living the tradwife dream — they have a house full of children and a loving, lifelong marriage to a dedicated husband and father. But the defining frameworks in their lives are faith and trust in God’s providence, not an image-conscious social media phenomenon. Understanding the decision- making process of mothers with five or more children is central to Pakaluk’s project, and she spends considerable time examining the costs of childbearing. Ultimately, Pakaluk says , women today face a different calculus than their grandmothers did: In the horse race between family and career enabled by the Pill, the family — unless valued very highly — loses to the alternative: dividing time between career and family, having children plus income, status, and other goods — but fewer children. The forces discouraging childbearing are immensely strong, and the only real force capable of overcoming the costs is a religiously motivated openness to life. By comparison, the tradwife trend is merely reactionary, though that’s certainly part of the appeal. By emphasizing the importance of marriage and family life, conservatives run the risk of putting undue pressure on young conservative women to get married as soon as possible — and many of those young women, eager to take advantage of peak fertility, certainly put that pressure on themselves. In a way, it was comforting to read the stories of the women in Hannah’s Children , some of whom were pregnant well into their 40s when Pakaluk spoke with them. Life is neither as short nor as long as it seems when you’re a twentysomething. The desire for marriage and children is a good one, but it’s a desire best expressed by an openness to marriage and children on God’s timeline, not your own. There’s a fine line to walk between seeking out a good thing and trusting that you cannot miss what God intends for you. This is, after all, what both the girlboss and the tradwife miss: the good life is a collaboration with God, not a project of self-actualization on one’s own terms. Pakaluk focuses on women with big families because they’re living a radically different life than most women. But the real lesson from Hannah’s Children is that the best number of children to have is the number of children God gives you.

"1","H ouston, we have a problem. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee took time off from leaving angry, obscene messages for underlings to give children a science lesson earlier this week. “Sometimes you need to take the opportunity just to come out and see a full moon is that complete rounded circle, which is made up mostly of gases,” she told students at Booker T. Washington High School in Houston. “And that’s why the question is why or how could we as humans live on the moon? Are the gases such that we could do that?” She went on to educate the students on the “energy” emitted by the moon, called it a “planet,” and offered the sudden proximity of the satellite with Earth to explain the cause of Monday’s solar eclipse. “The sun is a mighty powerful heat,” she noted, “but it’s almost impossible to go near the sun. The moon is more manageable.” In the 15-term congresswoman’s defense, she never referred to Neil Armstrong as the first man to walk on the sun or theorized about the casein properties of the moon. And it’s not like anyone in Houston knows anything about space , anyway. Sunny Hostin surmised on The View of the solar eclipse, last Friday’s northeast’s earthquake, and the emergence of trillions of cicadas, “All those things together would maybe lead one to believe that either climate change exists or something is really going on.” Voices of science and reason Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar interrupted to set Hostin straight. At the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, an activist-in-residence covering her face with sunglasses and a bandana and wearing gloves, a hat, and camouflage, instructed first-year medical students to pray to “the ancestors” and thank “mama Earth.” Lisa Gray-Garcia, who describes herself as formerly homeless and incarcerated, labeled Los Angeles “occupied” land,” called “private property” a “crapitalist lie,” and referred to European Americans as “settlers.” According to the Washington Free Beacon , she led chats during the mandatory class of “Free, Free Palestine” and called medicine “white science.” Physicians, heal thyself? One ventures an unscientific guess that at least one of the three — Jackson Lee, Hostin, or Gray-Garcia — displays an “In this house, we believe in science” sign on her front lawn. So do those who regard guys wearing Sonny Crockett’s stubble and Holly Golightly’s dress as women and imagine bacteria found on the fourth planet as “life on Mars” but deny that a fully formed baby inside her mother amounts to human life. Christopher Columbus famously hoodwinked the natives into doing his bidding by telling them God planned to inflame the moon with his “wrath” out of his displeasure with them. The Jamaican islanders reacted to the eclipse that the scientific-minded Columbus anticipated by showering provisions upon the explorer and his men. Jackson Lee, Hostin, Gray-Garcia, and the like see themselves as advanced, cutting- edge, and liberated from the benightedness of the past. They really demonstrate that beliefs we imagine as primitive thrive in 2024. One embarrassing difference separates then from now. Today, hubris rather than humility strangely accompanies ignorance. The trio appears more akin to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who pointed to the earthquake and the eclipse to warn that “God is sending America strong signs to tell us to repent,” than to anyone wearing a lab coat, pressed against a microscope, or who knows that a Petri dish does not refer to German cuisine. From leafy and tweedy universities, the botoxed and manicured on screens, and the marble halls of Congress, an unga-bunga quality pervades. To paraphrase Arch Oboler, It is earlier than you think .

"1","O n Thursday morning, Melissa Mackenzie called me and suggested that we talk about Mike Johnson in one of the segments of next week’s Spectacle Podcast . My reaction was that I didn’t want to. Of course, I’m doing it anyway, here in this column and next week when we pop out The Spectacle . But I go reluctantly. Why? Well, as regular readers of this column know, Mike is a personal friend of mine. He has been for a long time. I know him to be a very good conservative, one of the best in Congress. He’s a man of principle and, if he had the means to truly make policy, he would be very much be the revivalist figure America needs in leadership. And I can say this out of far more than mere personal feeling. Because, as regular readers of this column know, Mike Johnson wrote the foreword to my book The Revivalist Manifesto: How Patriots Can Win The Next American Era . That was well before he became House speaker. And, after he won the speakership, CNN used my book to trash Mike Johnson as a friend of racists, homophobes, and conspiracy theorists (like me, apparently). Which ended up selling a lot of copies of The Revivalist Manifesto . The point being that Johnson believes not just in trying to preserve our corrupt status quo but in bringing back an America that was prosperous, successful, sustainable, and dominant on the global stage. I believe this, and I believe it’s borne out in his words and, when he’s able, his deeds. But the “when he’s able” part of this is the rub. And it’s why I know I’ll be accused of shilling for Mike when I write or talk about him in a supportive way, and that’s why I’m reluctant to address this subject. It’s impossible to be an effective speaker of the House when you have a majority as small as Mike Johnson’s majority is. Utterly impossible. I noted this at The Hayride on Thursday after a bill to renew the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act failed due to conservative opposition, which was seen as a blow to Johnson: A Speaker’s job is to make a majority, particularly on “must- pass” bills like the federal appropriations instruments. Arguably, the FISA renewal is such a bill. Johnson has members of his caucus who are either RINOs or who represent swing districts. It’s hard to get them to come aboard for strong conservative reforms, for a couple of reasions: first, any such reforms are dead on arrival in the Democrat-dominated Senate, not to mention they’d be vetoed by Joe Biden if they made it that far. For those congressmen, there’s nothing but downside to voting for those reforms: they aren’t going to be making policy, so they’re not actually changing anything, plus they’re now going to get attacked by Democrat special interest groups for having backed those reforms. In a House majority with 240 members, let’s say, Johnson could simply excuse a few of those members to vote with the Democrats because he could bleed some votes and still pass the bill. He doesn’t have that freedom now. This means that Mike Johnson isn’t in the business of passing conservative legislation. He’s reduced to trying to pass moderate legislation because it’s a better alternative than passing leftist legislation – or passing nothing and getting trashed for grinding the House of Representatives down into dysfunction. Most conservatives would be perfectly happy to see the latter – including the grand spectacle of a government shutdown. The problem is, we’re not in the majority with such an opinion. Generally, voters think government shutdowns are a sign of incompetent governance and they generate negative political results. Which Johnson can’t afford, because virtually any sort of Democrat success in November will make Hakeem Jeffries the House Speaker. And as it stands, Marjorie Taylor Greene has a motion to vacate the chair hanging over Johnson’s head on the right, so he could lose his speakership in one of two ways. This is the reality staring Johnson in the face. I think Johnson was wrong to bring a FISA renewal bill that didn’t have a requirement of a warrant for surveillance of Americans. My hope is that when he brings that bill back up next week, such a requirement will be present, and at that time hopefully it will pass. Not because I believe FISA renewal is vital to our national security. I think the FBI and CIA ought to be broken up and made much smaller, and powers granted to them under laws like FISA should be greatly curtailed until such time as the law enforcement and intelligence agencies that might replace the FBI and CIA can be shown to be worthy of such powers. But there is no congressional majority for that kind of reform. And that’s Johnson’s problem. He has no ability to make that kind of policy. All he can do is to try to make good — or, at least, not awful — policy along the margins. Because that’s what he can sometimes make a majority for. And apparently there are some reforms in the FISA renewal bill. Adding a requirement for warrants would mean at least incremental positive change. It’s an impossible job. Johnson can’t really be judged until he has a working majority. He needs 20 more votes. And while this should be an election cycle in which those might be had in November, the larger question is whether Johnson can even hold on until then. This arising, of course, from the motion that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed against Johnson some weeks ago. But now it looks like Johnson is getting some wind added to his sails thanks to another personal friend of his, Donald Trump: Former president Donald Trump is set to appear with Johnson at an “election integrity” event at his Mar-a-Lago resort Friday — a joint event that hints at a burgeoning but tentative alliance between the two powerful Republicans. The upshot: Trump world isn’t happy with Greene’s threat to throw the House GOP into chaos once again. There’s a fear that an election-year speakership battle will undercut the party’s goals of keeping the House and flipping the White House and Senate. “One hundred percent distraction. Unwanted. And just stupid,” one Trump insider said Wednesday night. “We’re not going to get trapped into this cycle of bullshit that comes out of members of the House.” “It’s fair to say we don’t think she’s being constructive,” another person close with Trump said about Greene. “The internal fighting is not appreciated by [Trump].” Those around the former president are growing weary of the constant motion-to-vacate threats, that person added: “It’s no way to run a party; it’s no way to run a House. You can’t work in that environment.” The larger concern is that Johnson’s removal would create a power vacuum at a time when unity is essential and coordination between the Trump campaign and the speaker’s political operations is starting to tighten. For one, senior Trump adviser Chris LaCivita has been in close touch with Billy Constangy, Johnson’s top political operative who has worked alongside LaCivita in the past. Hayden Haynes, Johnson’s chief of staff, met recently with members of Trump’s team, and there’s talk about launching regular meetings between the Trump campaign and Johnson’s operation, as well as the RNC, NRCC and NRSC. Team Trump is beginning to take on something of a pragmatic approach to politics that isn’t universally positive. While Trump wasn’t wrong per se in declaring abortion a state issue, and while he can’t win the 2024 election if the Democrats are allowed to make it a national referendum on “reproductive freedom” or “women’s healthcare” (the euphemisms for infanticide truly are nauseating, aren’t they?), his announcement to that effect has certainly demoralized many in the pro-life community. (READ MORE: On Abortion, Trump Has Gravely Erred ) And perhaps Trump’s throwing in with Johnson might demoralize some as well. But Trump’s camp is definitely correct that strengthening the Republican House speaker in advance of an effort to build a true working majority under him is a necessary project for a successful administration beginning in January of next year. And there is nobody available at present who can replace Johnson. This is essentially a pre-speakership for Johnson. Team Trump recognizes that. It would be nice if conservatives across the country recognized it as well. And it would be even better if Johnson were able to repay that confidence with a wide array of populist, decentralizing, revivalist conservative reforms flowing through the House starting in January. That scenario alone won’t save the republic. But it can’t be saved without that as a start. Trump sees it. That’s why he’s acting to save Johnson. And it’s why he’s right to do so.

"1","I n my more than 40 years of practicing law, I have learned that while lawsuits can bring disputes to an end, they cannot solve problems. Unfortunately, not all other lawyers have learned the same thing, and the effects of this can be vexing both to the law and to public policy. As early as 2006, it was noted by Victor Schwartz and Phil Golberg how “some state attorneys general and personal injury lawyers have been trying to convert the tort of public nuisance into a cutting-edge legal theory” and to move it “far outside its traditional boundaries by using it to sue product manufacturers in an effort to circumvent the well-defined structure of products liability law.” While this may be a tempting shortcut around state legislatures for attorneys general to achieve their own policy ends, it represents a misuse of the legal system and could set a concerning new precedent for the use of public nuisance law. Schwartz and Golberg explain that public nuisance law has a long, albeit narrowly applicable, history. They note that the “essence” of public nuisance law “is to allow governments to use the tort system to stop quasi-criminal conduct that, while not illegal, is unreasonable given the circumstances and could cause injury to someone exercising a common, societal right.” That could mean “blocking a public roadway or, in recent times, dumping sewage into a public river or blasting a stereo when people are picnicking in a public park.” A corollary of this history is that members of the public who are inconvenienced can only sue for damages, while governmental bodies can only sue to stop or abate the nuisance but cannot sue for money damages. Many have identified the tobacco litigation of the 1990s as the “ watershed event ” in the process of turning product liability claims into nuisance claims. It also marked a significant step in normalizing contingency fee arrangements between private law firms and government entities, as it was the first time that attorneys general in a number of states entered into such agreements to support their legal efforts. Coincidentally, not only did these law firms stand to rake in huge amounts of fees from these no-bid contracts, but they frequently turned out to be top contributors to the hiring attorney general’s campaign fund. Then–Connecticut Attorney General (and now Sen.) Richard Blumenthal, for example, hired four firms in total — including three that were in-state — to support his litigation efforts. These included Blumental’s former law firm, his former partner’s wife’s firm, and a firm whose managing counsel served as personal counsel and counselor to then–Connecticut Gov. John Rowland. Those three law firms, each of which was plugged into the attorney general or the governor, split $65 million in legal fees . The attorneys general of other states, including Kansas , Texas , and Missouri, also hired friends and gave them giant paydays. Most notably, then–Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon hired five law firms that had made contributions of more than $500,000 to his campaigns over eight years. Even though Missouri was the 27th state to join the tobacco litigation — and, as a result, the legal heavy lifting was already done — those firms split $111 million in fees. Yet despite this blatant display of cronyism and backscratching, many current attorneys general seem intent on making the same mistake today. As Schwartz and Goldberg further explain, “Even though no court validated the use of public nuisance theory in the tobacco litigation, the use of public nuisance theory quickly became a misleading aspect of the state attorney general tobacco litigation legend.” Such misconceptions have pushed attorneys general to continue to move forward with this flawed legal strategy in other lawsuits, even though this litigation is hardly a model to be emulated. The latest iteration of that legend has seen public nuisance statutes used by states and localities to pursue reimbursement for the effects of opioid addiction. The state of Oklahoma and the city of Baltimore have both contracted with plaintiffs’ trial counsel to pursue claims of reimbursement for the effects of opioid addiction in their jurisdictions. Fortunately, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed a judgment in favor of the state, reasoning that public nuisance law was not an appropriate remedy for the harm caused by opioid abuse, but Baltimore’s lawsuit continues to move forward and poses a serious legal threat. The use of public nuisance claims by governmental bodies to pursue reimbursement for costs they claim to have suffered turns that theory on its head. Those actually injured by opioids are those who have abused them, something that the governmental bodies bringing suit haven’t done. Their proper role under public nuisance theory is to seek to abate the nuisance, not pursue damages. It is also odd to apply public nuisance law to a commercial activity, particularly one that is so highly regulated as the prescription drug industry. More to the point, if one product can be the object of a public nuisance lawsuit, where is the stopping point? Other lawyers have solicited governmental bodies to hold energy producers liable for claimed injuries attributable to climate change. As Judge William Alsup observed in 2018 , the lawyers behind the lawsuits were “asking for billions of dollars for something that hasn’t happened yet and may never happen to the extent you’re predicting it will happen.” Should an attorney general successfully bring a public nuisance case against an opioid manufacturer or energy company, it could leave the door open for them to go after other politically undesirable industries and effectively sue them out of business, ultimately achieving a policy end run when they are legislating through litigation. In the end, courts should be far more alert to efforts by lawyers to use them to solve problems. As is clear, lawsuit decide cases; they don’t solve problems."
"1","I t wasn’t about Israel. It was Nov. 28, 1941. Israel, founded in 1948 — seven years later — did not exist. The territory of modern-day Israel and Palestine was then under the control the British. Europe was at war. Adolf Hitler’s Germany was on the march. It had conquered France, Poland, the Czech Republic, and invaded Russia. But on this November day, meeting at his office in the Reich Chancellory in Berlin, Hitler was meeting with a decidedly non-European individual. Hitler’s visitor was one Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and a Palestinian Arab. A careful record of their conversation was kept. And over there at the Times of Israel , the essence of that conversation has been published . Among other things said to Hitler by the Grand Mufti was this: The Arabs were Germany’s natural friends because they had the same enemies as had Germany, namely the English, the Jews and the Communists. To which Hitler replied that: Germany stood for uncompromising war against the Jews…. Germany was resolved, step by step, to ask one European nation after the other to solve its Jewish problem, and at the proper time to direct a similar appeal to non-European nations as well. As soon as Germany had won the war, Hitler said: Germany’s objective would then be solely the destruction of the Jewish element residing in the Arab sphere under the protection of British power. In that hour the Mufti would be the most authoritative spokesman for the Arab world. In other words? The existence of Israel is not at the center of the current war in the Middle East. The center of this war — as the hardcore history of the decidedly pre-Israel Hitler–Grand Mufti meeting a full 83 years ago so vividly demonstrates — is about killing Jews. Exterminating an entire race of human beings. And doing so for no other reason than hatred of Jews. Which is exactly what motivated Hitler to launch the Holocaust. That was the position of the Palestinian Grand Mufti in 1941 — and it is the position of Hamas and Iran and their allies today. The question for Americans now is why President Joe Biden doesn’t understand this most basic fact in world history. Only in the last few days have Jew-haters gathered in Dearborn, Michigan, to shouts of “Death to Israel!” and “Death to America!” What they really mean, of course, is “Death to Jews.” Reuters reports : Biden, 80, has evolved in the face of a challenging 2024 reelection bid, threats by some would-be supporters to withhold their votes over his lack of backing for Palestinians, and a warning from former President Barack Obama that Israel’s actions could backfire. What happened on Oct. 7 was, simply put, an attack designed, Hitler-style, to kill as many Jews as possible. If there was a wave of a magic wand that could replace Jews in the Middle East with, say, Presbyterians or Catholics or Black Baptists, it is entirely possible none of what’s happening would be happening. The hard central fact of not just our time but seemingly time immemorial is hatred for Jews. Which all too frequently results in murderous wars designed to kill Jews at a maximum, or, at a minimum, anti-Semitism. An anti-Semitism that has sadly erupted in 21st- century America on one college campus after another. The question is obvious. When will America — in this case Joe Biden as president of the United States — take on this virus of Jew hatred directly? To call it out for what it is, whether in Dearborn, Michigan, the rest of America, the Middle East, or any other corner of the globe where it can be found? Pretending that what the Grand Mufti and Adolf Hitler were about in 1941 is no longer happening, or ignoring it altogether in today’s 21st century, will not solve what is a very real — and dangerous — problem.

You decide in the comments below. ***** PROMPT: Write a 500-word piece about the role Republicans have played in emancipating Black Americans. Cite specific examples from the Civil War, Reconstruction, the civil rights movement, and during the 21st century. AI: The Republican Party has played a crucial role in the emancipation and advancement of Black Americans throughout American history. Since its inception in the mid-19th century, the party has been at the forefront of efforts to secure equality and civil rights for Black citizens. During the Civil War era, Republicans led the charge against the institution of slavery. President Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, declaring all slaves in Confederate-held territory to be free. This landmark executive order was a pivotal moment in the fight against slavery, laying the groundwork for the eventual passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery nationwide. The Republican-controlled Congress played a significant role in ratifying this amendment in 1865. In the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War, Republicans continued their commitment to securing the rights of Black Americans. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 and 1868, passed by Republican-led Congresses, aimed to rebuild the South and ensure the political and civil rights of freed slaves. These acts granted Black men the right to vote, hold political office, and participate fully in the democratic process—an unprecedented step towards racial equality in the United States. During the 20th century, the Republican Party remained a steadfast advocate for civil rights. In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, signed the Civil Rights Act of 1957, marking the first major civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. This act aimed to protect the voting rights of African Americans and laid the groundwork for subsequent civil rights laws. The Republican Party continued to play a prominent role in advancing civil rights during the turbulent 1960s. Republican leaders such as Senator Everett Dirksen were instrumental in the passage of landmark civil rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These laws, which were signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, enjoyed bipartisan support and helped dismantle legal segregation and voter suppression tactics that disenfranchised Black Americans. In the 21st century, Republicans have continued to champion policies aimed at promoting equality and opportunity for Black Americans. While there may be differing views within the party on certain issues related to race and social justice, many Republicans have supported initiatives such as criminal justice reform, economic empowerment programs, and educational opportunities aimed at narrowing the racial wealth gap and addressing systemic inequalities. For example, the First Step Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018, was a bipartisan effort aimed at reforming federal sentencing laws and reducing recidivism rates, particularly impacting Black communities disproportionately affected by mass incarceration. In conclusion, the Republican Party has played a significant role in emancipating and advancing the rights of Black Americans throughout American history. From the abolition of slavery during the Civil War era to the passage of landmark civil rights legislation and efforts to address contemporary issues of racial inequality, the party has been a driving force in shaping the trajectory of civil rights in the United States."
"1","T he U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to hear a case addressing one of the most pressing issues of our time: whether public schools can secretly transition children behind the backs of parents. The case arises from a policy of the Montgomery County Board of Education (MBCE) in Maryland that obligates school officials to hide children’s gender choices from parents. Parents Defending Education, a non-profit watchdog, estimates that the MBCE policy is just one of the 1,060 such policies in the nation that cover more than 10 million children . Under these policies, children, with the help of school officials, live out one gender identity at school, and school officials communicate with parents as if nothing has changed, as if their child isn’t living a new life and going by a new name and using new restrooms. The parents challenging the policy lost in the lower courts and appealed to the Supreme Court in late 2023. In a positive sign, the Supreme Court asked the school board to submit an opposition brief, indicating that the court is seriously considering whether to weigh in on the dispute. Gender identity ideology has infected the nation, and it is spreading particularly fast through the public school system. The court should take the case and vindicate the bedrock principle that has governed western civilization for centuries: that parents have a fundamental right to direct the education and moral upbringing of their children — including at public schools. The Gender Policy MBCE’s “ Guidelines for Gender Identity ” are designed to ensure that all students “feel comfortable expressing their gender identity” and to “[s]upport students so they may participate in school life consistent with their asserted gender identity.” To accomplish that goal, the guidelines guarantee all students — prekindergarten through 12th grade — at least two things: (1) “the right to keep private one’s transgender status or gender nonconforming presentation” and (2) the right to express their gender identity at school. Critically, school staff are instructed to use “the student’s legal name and pronoun that correspond to the student’s sex assigned at birth” when communicating with parents — unless the student has specified otherwise. For those students wrestling with their gender identity, school officials should develop a “gender support plan” that ensures the student is not discriminated against in his or her new gender identity, including which names and pronouns to use, athletics, locker rooms, extracurriculars, bathrooms, etc. The support plans are also designed to ascertain whether the student’s parents “are aware of and supportive of the student’s gender identity.” If the student’s parents are deemed “nonsupportive,” school officials are instructed to “withhold information” from parents. (READ MORE: I Read Ellen ‘Elliot’ Page’s Pageboy , and It Shows Just How Half-Baked Transgenderism Is ) Based on this policy, students as young as 5 can transition to a different gender, and their parents may never even know about it. And it isn’t as though the public schools are passive players in the gender ideology war. School districts across the nation are aggressively “ indoctrinating children in gender identity ideology ” and actively facilitating the transition of young children — all while hiding this information from parents. Legal Issues Debated by the Supreme Court The parents’ primary argument is that the policy violates their “fundamental right to direct the upbringing and education of their children.” Before addressing that issue, however, there is a second, antecedent issue at stake: whether the parents even have a legal right to bring the case. This doctrine, known as “standing,” is an important constitutional doctrine rooted in separation-of- powers principles that seeks to ensure that courts decide real “cases” between parties who are actually injured by the law or policy being challenged. Standing keeps courts in their proper lane in our constitutional republic and ensures that most political and legal issues are resolved not by unelected judges but by using our normal democratic processes — elections and the court of public opinion. The Constitution reserves many issues to “we the people,” and standing helps preserve this important principle. But not here. Our independent judiciary stands as a bulwark against tyranny, and no court should hide behind secondary legal doctrines to shirk its primary duty — upholding the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals held that the parents had no standing to bring this case because they didn’t allege that any of their children were struggling with their gender identity or that the schools were withholding any information from them. The court is dead wrong on this point, as the dissenting opinion made clear. Indeed, how could parents know this information when the policy itself prevents them from accessing the very information that the majority says is needed to bring the case? Moreover, the law doesn’t require citizens to wait to suffer irreparable harm before they can bring suit to vindicate their constitutional rights. If that were the law, parents would have no right to bring a case until it was too late, until their son or daughter had already undergone a social transition with the help of school officials. As the dissent noted, if the 4th Circuit’s decision stands, gender issues — perhaps the most sensitive and important topic a child can face today — will be pulled “from the family circle to the public schools without any avenue of redress by the Parents.” That cannot be the law. Even more important than standing is the merits of the case. Do parents have any say, any rights, over their children’s education after they enroll them in public school? According to one side of the debate, the answer is no. Once parents choose to send their children to public school, any rights they may have had are gone, and children belong to the state. This is not the law. The history of Western civilization and our nation makes clear that parents, not the state, possess the fundamental right to educate their children and direct their moral upbringing. And both simple logic and cases from our early history make clear that parents retain this right at public schools. While schools do stand “in place of the parent” for limited purposes, such as teaching children core subjects like math and science, courts should never presume that parents have “delegated authority” to schools to instruct and indoctrinate children in what the Supreme Court calls “matters of public concern,” i.e., fundamental worldview issues. As a brief submitted to court for this case states, “This is particularly true given the changes in public education occurring over the last two centuries—changes including compulsory education, the inability of parents to sign employment contracts with the state, the coercive economic power of the state in public education, and state-mandated educational agendas.” Gender ideology is certainly a matter of public concern, as the Supreme Court itself has made clear. The ideology, the brief explains, is “rooted in a worldview called expressive individualism, which holds that human identity is primarily sexual and is rooted in a person’s own psychological and subjective view of oneself. It touches on the deepest moral, social, and religious questions, even going to the heart of what it means to be human. Accordingly, decisions related to children’s gender choices are reserved for parents, and ‘the state has no right to facilitate a child’s social gender transition or hide it’ from them.” At issue in this case is one of the pillars on which our nation and Western civilization itself was built: the right of parents to direct their children’s moral formation. Rebuking these schools and vindicating the rights of parents is critical to preserving liberty and stemming the rising tide of totalitarianism on the left.

"1","T he ancient Chinese military theorist Sun Tzu taught that a battle is won before it is fought because it is won by choosing the terrain on which it will be fought. If former President Donald Trump and other Republicans on the ballot this fall want to win, they must choose the proper terrain. That means a focus on key issues that play to comparative GOP strengths: immigration, crime, and inflation/the economy. President Joe Biden’s job approval rating on each issue is horrific — on immigration above all, and rightly so. Furthermore, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll, independents rate immigration and the economy as their top two issues this cycle; those just happen to be Republicans’ top two issues, as well. That’s a marked contrast from Democrats’ top issues, which per Quinnipiac are climate change, gun violence, and preserving democracy. The disconnect between Democratic partisans and independent Americans is real, pronounced, and ripe for exploitation. If the goal is to win elections — a necessary condition for actually wielding political power and implementing one’s preferred policies — then it makes no sense to focus on issues that do not play to one’s comparative strength. This is so obvious that it hardly needs to be said. (READ A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE: On Abortion, Trump Has Gravely Erred ) In U.S. politics, abortion is not currently an issue of comparative strength for pro- lifers and the only major party that pays any lip service to our cause, the GOP. True, numerous Republican governors have won elections in recent years after enacting pro-life legislation. But every time the issue has been directly presented to voters since the Dobbs Supreme Court case of 2022 mercifully overturned Roe’s abortion “right,” the pro-life side has lost. Most recently, the voters of conservative-leaning Ohio voted for Issue 1, a ballot initiative broadly legalizing abortion. This is painful to concede, as a long- time pro-lifer. And it is made doubly painful by my belief, as this column has previously argued, that a proper interpretation of the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause requires construing “person(s)” in the constitutional text to include all natural persons — born and unborn. The upshot is that abortion should not merely be banned by legislative majorities — it should be held unconstitutional . And it would be if we lived in an ideal world. But we live in the real world. It is against this backdrop that Trump, the man who called himself “very pro-choice” in a 1999 interview but who subsequently became the darling of the pro-life movement after his three Supreme Court nominees all joined the historic Dobbs majority, released a new video on abortion. Trump rejected pro-life advocacy groups’ call for any kind of national legislation, instead taking the stance that abortion ought to be a “states’ rights” issue. Echoing Stephen Douglas’ “popular sovereignty” rhetoric from his 1858 debates against Abraham Lincoln, Trump stated, “the states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land.” So, is Trump’s stance correct? In terms of principle — meaning the substantive debate over whether, to borrow from Lincoln’s 1854 Peoria speech, the unborn child is not or is a natural person — Trump’s stance is incorrect. But in terms of discerning empirical realities and exercising political prudence — another defining Lincolnian virtue — Trump’s stance is defensible and perhaps even reasonable. It would have been best if Trump had staked out the position of supporting a 15-week (or even 20-week) national ban as a backstop, as some of his presidential primary opponents did. But Republicans will not attain a filibuster-proof, 60-senator majority after November, so such talk is academic. The real impact of Trump’s stance is rhetorical abandonment (for now) on the national stage, thus letting the Democratic Party’s abortion-rights radicals attempt to fill the legislative void absent meaningful opposition. But that damage is mitigated by the benefit of shifting the campaign trail terrain on the national stage to issues of comparative political strength, as Sun Tzu would advise. That tradeoff presents a judgment call on which reasonable minds can disagree. When one tactically retreats, though, it is still imperative to articulate the value of the principle at issue. Trump could learn a lot here from Lincoln. So too, for that matter, could certain prominent Republicans in Arizona, such as former Gov. Doug Ducey and U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake, who reacted with shock and dismay to a state Supreme Court this week upholding the dignity of unborn human life. Overall, the pro-life cause must be less concerned with short-term tactical disagreements and more concerned with unanimity as to the long-term goal. If “states’ rights” (which Dobbs gave us) becomes the goal, that is a big problem. The true goal remains unambiguous: constitutional personhood. We have a lot of hearts and minds still to persuade to get there. But we also need political power. Hence, the paradox.

"2","The kids are not all right — and the device you are probably reading this on is to blame. So argues the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. In his new book, The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness , Haidt insists that smartphones and social media are fueling a “surge of suffering” that’s inundating teens all across the Western world. By Haidt’s account, smartphones and the addicting social media apps we download onto them have lured the world’s youths away from those activities that are indispensable to healthy child development — such as outdoor play, face-to-face conversation with friends, and sleep — and trapped them in a digital realm that saps their self-esteem, drains their attention spans, and forces them to put on a perpetual, high-stakes performance of their own personalities. Smartphones have even hurt kids who don’t use them much, according to Haidt, because they’ve restructured communal life in harmful ways. Teenagers’ rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide have all skyrocketed as a result. The author’s argument has resonated with many parents, and The Anxious Generation has topped the New York Times Best Sellers list in nonfiction. But his theory has also attracted no small number of critics. For years, prominent psychologists have been accusing Haidt of fueling a moral panic. In their view , there is “no evidence that using these platforms is rewiring children’s brains or driving an epidemic of mental illness.” They insist that Haidt’s case against smartphones and social media apps owes less to the available data than to humanity’s perennial anxieties about new technologies and kids these days. This dispute has generated reams of commentary as the media’s middle-aged social media users argue about whether their favorite apps are poisoning their kids. But few if any of these pieces have closely scrutinized how Haidt’s evidence stacks up against that of his detractors — and when one digs into these competing data points, the fundamental premises of the smartphone debate are thrown into question. In truth, it’s not entirely clear that there even is an international decline in teen mental health that requires explanation. Ultimately, both Haidt and his critics overstate their evidence. The former’s case isn’t strong enough to prove that iPhones “destroyed” Gen Z, but it also isn’t so weak that it can be dismissed as the mere byproduct of a moral panic. How smartphones are (supposedly) warping the minds of young people throughout the wealthy world The foundational premise of Haidt’s argument is that something has been eroding the psychological well-being of young people over the past 14 years. The Anxious Generation substantiates this claim with a barrage of grim data points: The percentage of US teens who say that they’ve had one “major depressive episode” in the past year has increased by more than 150 percent since 2010, with the bulk of that increase coming before the COVID pandemic. The share of US undergraduates with a diagnosed anxiety disorder increased by 134 percent between 2010 and 2020, while those with a depression diagnosis increased by 106 percent. Among American girls between the ages of 10 and 14, emergency room visits for self-harm grew by 188 percent during that period, while deaths by suicide increased by 167 percent. Among boys of the same age, ER visits for self-harm increased by 48 percent and suicide by 91 percent. The suicide rate among US teens between the ages of 15 and 19 also increased over this time period, though seemingly to a lesser degree. But this crisis is not confined to the US , Haidt says. Canadian teens’ self-reported mental health also started nosediving around 2012, and their rates of emergency room visits due to self-harm jumped as well. And adolescents in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, the Nordic countries , and most of Protestant Europe followed a similar trajectory. According to Haidt, one international survey of 15-year- olds found that feelings of loneliness at school spiked in every world region but Asia between 2012 and 2015. Notably, in almost all cases, declines in mental health were much more pronounced among girls than boys. From this, he concludes that something rewired young people’s brains beginning in the early 2010s, all across the wealthy world. The rollout of smartphones fills the bill. Haidt notes that by 2013, a majority of US households owned an iPhone, an Android phone, or their like. And smartphone became similarly ubiquitous in many other rich nations shortly thereafter. So, his prime suspect was in the right places at the right time. And he insists that the smartphone left its fingerprints all over anxious Zoomers’ brains. His case for the phone’s culpability rests on three main pieces of evidence. 1) In surveys of adolescents , respondents who heavily use social media are more likely to report anxiety and depression than those who use the apps less. Haidt acknowledges that this correlation does not appear in every survey. But he insists that there is a broad consensus across studies that heavy social media use correlates with anxiety and depression, and that this association is especially strong for girls. This indicates that there is an association between social media use and worse mental health outcomes. But it does not tell us that the former causes the latter. After all, depression might lead young people to develop Instagram addictions, rather than vice versa. But Haidt’s second piece of evidence speaks to causality. 2) When researchers instructed a random sample of college students to abstain from social media for a period of time, those students tended to report improved psychological well-being (relative to themselves at the start of the study and/or to a control group). Conversely, when researchers forced college students to consume social media in a laboratory setting, they tended to report worse mental health. For example, when a team of psychologists assigned a group of college women to scroll Instagram for seven minutes, they expressed lower satisfaction with their bodies and a more negative emotional states afterward than those who were assigned to a control group. Of course, laboratory experiments measure artificial conditions, and they only gauge the effect that social media has directly on an individual. The latter is a significant limitation for Haidt’s purposes, since he believes that the mass adoption of social media may be most damaging for its indirect effects on entire communities: In a school where virtually all young people spend the bulk of their leisure time online, a kid who doesn’t use social media apps will still suffer from their consequences. For example, such a student will have fewer opportunities to socialize with classmates in the real world than they would’ve had in the pre-smartphone era. But Haidt has a third piece of evidence that arguably captures smartphones’ impact on collective life. 3) When communities gain access to high-speed internet — and, thus, better access to social media — their teens’ psychological well-being tends to decline. The Anxious Generation cites five studies that found when fiber optic cables arrived in an area, local rates of teen mental health diagnoses and hospitalizations started rising. Finally, Haidt casts the gender gap in teen mental health as a fourth piece of evidence. 4) Girls are more vulnerable to social media’s harms and have registered a larger increase in mental health problems since 2012 than boys. Haidt substantiates that first claim by noting that, relative to boys, girls are more prolific users of social media, more likely to express aggression by trying to destroy their ex-friends’ reputations and relationships (a task that social media greatly facilitates), and more vulnerable to body image disorders (which platforms like Instagram tend to exacerbate). He weds this empirical evidence to a theory of how smartphones and social media undermine teens’ mental health. He notes that phones now claim most of young people’s leisure time, leaving them little room for myriad activities that are indispensable for healthy development. According to Gallup , American teens spend an average of almost five hours a day on social media platforms. When you account for streaming, video games, and other screen-based activities, adolescents are devoting nearly nine hours a day to digital media consumption, as the Common Sense Census found . That screen time comes at the expense of sleep , exercise, and spending face-to- face time with friends, all of which are associated with mental well-being and healthy child development. The case against the case against smartphones Haidt’s theory has attracted many critics, who have collectively raised objections to virtually every premise in his narrative. Their case can be distilled into four arguments. 1) It’s not clear that there has actually been an international increase in mental illness among young people. There is no question that adolescent suicide rates have risen in the United States in recent years. But, as Stetson University Psychologist Christopher Ferguson told Vox, America’s recent suicide increase is not a phenomenon specific to teens — suicide has been increasing in the US among virtually all age groups. Across the Western world more broadly, there was no uniform increase in teen suicide during the 2010s in the World Health Organization’s data . In fact, between 2012 and 2019, the suicide rate among people aged 15 to 19 fell by 36 percent in France; 20 percent in Denmark; 64 percent in Ireland; 59 percent in New Zealand; 11 percent in Norway; 28 percent in Spain; and 36 percent in Belgium. Across Europe as a whole, the suicide rate among older teens fell by 26 percent in this period. This is a big problem for Haidt’s thesis, according to his skeptics, because suicide rates are the most reliable indicator of mental health trends. Most other data on psychological well-being can be distorted by changes in social norms. We have witnessed globe-spanning campaigns in recent decades to destigmatize mental health problems. At the same time, many clinicians have expanded the definition of various psychological disorders, a process that critics dub “diagnostic inflation.” For this reason, just because teens in a given country have become more likely to say that they feel “anxious” or “depressed” — or be diagnosed with a mood disorder — that does not necessarily mean that their actual subjective experience has grown worse. Rather, those with mood disorders may be more likely to know that they suffer from such a condition or more likely to admit that they do. Meanwhile, some teens who suffer from sadness or stress that does not rise to a clinical level may be more inclined to conceptualize their feelings in clinical terms. Data on hospital visits for self-harm, suicidal ideation, and mental health problems are vulnerable to similar distortions, University of Oxford psychologist Andrew Przybylski told Vox. This is because hospital systems’ recordkeeping protocols can change over time. In 2015, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) — a World Health Organization guide that instructs hospitals how to code diagnoses in official records — implemented a new edition, which recommended multiple major changes to coding practices. For example, before 2015, a clinician needed to enter two separate codes in order to log a case of self-harm: They needed to first enter the type of injury (such as a Xanax overdose) and then separately mark whether the injury was intentional or accidental. Clinicians often neglected to enter the second code, according to researchers, which led to an undercount of self-harm incidents. After the new ICD was adopted in October 2015, however, clinicians were able to record an intentional benzodiazepine overdose with a single code. Recorded instances of self-harm promptly spiked in many health systems. But this was a consequence of the coding changes rather than a reflection of any actual increase in cases. The ICD’s revisions affect hospitals worldwide and have distorted some data on adolescent mental health. Przybylski noted that New Jersey hospitals saw a large spike in suicide-related visits among young people during the 2010s — a development that, on its face, might seem to support Haidt’s thesis. And yet, despite this apparent jump in youth suicidality, the actual teen and child suicide rates in New Jersey were essentially flat over the same period. When researchers from Princeton and North Carolina State University investigated this disparity, they concluded that the spike in suicide-related visits was largely the product of coding changes. In view of these measurement distortions and the falling youth suicide rates in Europe, Haidt’s critics argue that it’s unclear whether there even is a deepening teen mental health crisis that requires explanation. 2) The survey data doesn’t actually support Haidt’s thesis. Yes, there is a correlation between self-reported social media use and poor mental health in some surveys of adolescents, Haidt’s critics acknowledge. But taken together, they argue, the empirical literature shows a weak to nonexistent association between screen time and mental health. Further, in their view , Haidt’s own cherry-picked figures imply that social media use only explains about 15 percent of the variation in mental health between teens, meaning that other factors must account for the other 85 percent. 3) Haidt’s experimental evidence is weak and unreliable. To prove that social media causes mental distress, Haidt points to experiments in which researchers prohibited a random sample of college students from using social media for weeks and then evaluated their mental health. In a review of such experiments that will soon be published in the journal Psychology of Popular Media , Stetson’s Christopher Ferguson found that “evidence for causal effects was statistically no different than zero.” Ferguson’s paper acknowledges that some experiments have produced results consistent with Haidt’s hypothesis. But he argues that these studies are generally plagued by methodological problems. For one thing, many test subjects never report back to researchers after their prescribed period of abstinence. This could bias the studies’ results: A student who found that abstaining from social media was bad for their mental health might be more likely to drop out of a study than a student who benefited psychologically from logging off. 4) Haidt’s natural experiments are contradicted by better data. Haidt’s skeptics are similarly unimpressed by his citation of quasi-experiments in which the spread of broadband internet was linked to teen mental health problems. After all, there are only five of these studies, and each examines only a small subset of the developed world’s population. Last year, Oxford’s Przybylski and Tilburg University researcher Matti Vuorre decided to see whether the correlation between high-speed internet access and worse teen mental health held up at scale. In their study , they examined changes in mobile broadband subscriptions and teen mental health outcomes in 202 countries over 19 years — and found that access to the internet (and, thus, social media) was not consistently linked with negative psychological outcomes. “There’s nothing here that isn’t present in any of the past panics about video games, Dungeons & Dragons, or silent movies,” Przybylski told Vox. “Each of these, you have a new technology, a vulnerable group and a new mechanism. It’s always ‘This time it’s different,’ but there’s nothing in these claims that actually distinguishes it in terms of scientific evidence.” So, are smartphones really poisoning Gen Z’s brains? I’m not a social psychologist, nor a parent of a TikTok-obsessed tween. So I shouldn’t be trusted as the final arbiter of this dispute. But in my view, the case for believing that smartphones are undermining teens’ mental health is significantly weaker than Haidt suggests — yet stronger than his most ardent skeptics allow. It’s not clear that an international crisis of teen mental health even exists. In its account of a global surge in adolescent distress, The Anxious Generation engages in a bit of cherry-picking. Haidt’s metric for whether a given country has witnessed a decline in teen mental health since 2012 shifts from one nation to another. In the United States, he holds up an increase in teen suicides as evidence of a deepening crisis. In the Nordic countries, he cites survey data showing elevated rates of psychological distress but does not mention that teen suicide declined in Denmark, Finland, and Norway in the wake of the smartphone revolution. Nor does Haidt’s book grapple with the fact that multiple international surveys of young people’s life satisfaction and well-being have failed to detect any clear decline since 2012. Even Haidt’s own preferred international survey shows no signs of an increase in adolescent distress in Asia, the world’s most populous region. Given that Asians are 1) human beings with the same child development needs as everyone else and 2) prolific users of social media (at least in many national contexts), it is unclear how Haidt reconciles this survey finding with his thesis. Ultimately, the absence of a clear pattern in global suicide data — combined with the various changes to diagnostic criteria and coding guidelines that could be inflating mental health statistics — should temper Haidt’s claims about the post-2012 “surge of suffering” more than they have. To say that Haidt’s evidence for a global decline in teen mental health isn’t conclusive is not to say that it’s insignificant. Haidt acknowledges that changes in social norms and coding practices may have contributed to the apparent increase in adverse teen mental outcomes over the past decade. But his research assistant Zach Rausch pointed out to me that, at least in the US, the uptick in adolescent cases of self-harm began years before the ICD’s coding changes. More broadly, it remains the case that a wide variety of alarming indicators — from mental health hospitalizations to anxiety and depression diagnoses — did abruptly increase starting in the early 2010s in a wide range of Western countries. And in virtually every case, the increase was significantly larger among girls than among boys. If we were looking at random noise, we would not expect to see this largely uniform gendered pattern. However, the empirical evidence linking social media to teen mental distress is much weaker than Haidt suggests. Haidt acknowledges that the association between social media use and mood disorders in survey data appears small on its face. But he maintains that surveys are flawed tools for capturing the harms of social media in any case. He told me that smartphones have hurt teen mental health in a wide range of different ways — some that have primarily affected boys, some girls, and some both. Analyzing the correlation between heavy social media use and depression in survey data might illuminate one of these mechanisms: the way that social media addiction corrodes mental well- being. But, Haidt explains, you don’t need to be a heavy user of social media to suffer a public shaming, fall prey to Instagram-induced body dysmorphia, or have few opportunities for outdoor play because everyone else is staring at their phones. Thus, correlational studies don’t tell the full story. “It’s kind of like if someone was trying to explain obesity growth in the 1980s, and they were to argue that, well, we measured french fry consumption, and there’s a bit of an effect, but it really isn’t enough to explain everything,” Haidt said. “Then I would say, well, okay, a part of it is french fries — we do eat a lot of french fries. But what about corn sweetener?” This is a reasonable argument. But it also amounts to an admission that the correlational studies don’t do all that much by themselves to substantiate Haidt’s thesis. Meanwhile, Ferguson’s paper persuasively argues that experimental studies on social media and mental health have collectively produced mixed results and suffer from major methodological flaws. The natural experiments that Haidt cites are more compelling. But they should be interpreted cautiously in light of Przybylski and Vuorre’s inability to detect any strong association between broadband subscriptions and teen mental health internationally in their 2023 study. Nonetheless, taken together, it seems clear that Haidt’s rhetoric is much stronger than his evidence. I still suspect the phones are bad All this said, I can’t bring myself to accept Przbylski’s view — that there is no reason to believe that social media is harming teen’s mental health, and that claims to the contrary merely reflect an age-old cycle of moral panics about new technologies. In my view, “It is not healthy for kids to spend five hours a day staring at social media feeds that invite negative social comparisons, reward pile-ons, and induce addiction by design” strikes me as a pretty reasonable default assumption — not least because I probably spend about that much time staring at X (formerly Twitter ) daily and surely suffer mentally as a result. Granted, unlike me, the typical tween probably doesn’t spend much time sparring with @stalinlover69 and @auschwitzenthusiast1488 while their girlfriend says things like “Please put the phone down” and “Is this really how you’re going to spend our anniversary?” But it still seems doubtful to me that kids are benefiting from spending less time hanging out with close friends in person and more time performing their selves on social media platforms in an often invidious competition for approval and attention. Haidt’s work on teen mental health might be biased by his preexisting contempt for social media; he had initially intended to write a book lamenting Twitter’s impact on our politics before shifting his focus to Gen Z’s psychological woes. But his critics may have biases of their own. Ferguson and Przbylski have both spent much of their careers debunking alarmist theories about video games’ corruption of the youth and are inclined to view the discourse around social media through that lens. In our conversation, Przbylski said he doubted that using social media shortens people’s attention spans. To me, this is a bit like doubting that chewing broken glass causes oral discomfort. And I imagine most of my fellow heavy X users would agree. Definitively determining how social media affects adolescent mental health is going to take more time and research. Fortunately, there’s plenty we can do to help psychologically distressed teens in the interim, whether or not they log off. Will you support Vox today?

"2","Netflix is banned in China — part of the government’s ongoing efforts to limit both foreign influence and Chinese citizens’ access to information about their own country. But that hasn’t stopped Chinese viewers, as well as Chinese state media, from weighing in on its highly anticipated adaptation of the Hugo Award-winning 2008 Chinese sci-fi novel The Three-Body Problem . Many people aren’t happy, yet there’s more to this particular backlash than just fan disgruntlement. The first of an esteemed trilogy sometimes known as Remembrance of Earth’s Past , the novel The Three-Body Problem is a high- concept fictionalization of a longstanding scientific enigma known as “the three-body problem.” It’s heavy on the science , and author Liu Cixin, a native of mainland China, takes a long view of existential problems that mirror those we’re currently grappling with today, most notably the ethics surrounding our response to advanced artificial intelligence . One of the novel’s central themes is the question of who gets to decide the future for the rest of humanity. It takes an anti-authoritarian approach that’s bolstered by the author’s experience of authoritarianism in China. One of its central characters functions as a strong critique of the Communist Revolution, and the whole novel arguably critiques the modern-day Communist Party. This critique takes center stage, quite literally, in a controversial opening scene from the book that references a violent period of China’s history rarely shown in China itself. Despite this, the novel The Three-Body Problem not only cleared China’s broad book ban on anti-government messaging (although before Xi Jinping ’s subsequent tightening of censorship across the cultural front) but has become beloved in its home nation. It won multiple awards and gets held up by many as an example of China’s literary excellence and as a major influence in the development of Chinese science fiction. In 2023, another acclaimed and lavish series adapting the book, Three Body , was released by Chinese streaming service Tencent (the show is also currently streaming with English subtitles on Viki ; the first two eps are also on YouTube ). Three Body has won praise from viewers at home and abroad for staying faithful to the book and its themes; on the popular review forum MyDramaList, for example, the Tencent series has a viewer rating of 8.3/10. This is important context to understand the conversations that have taken place on Weibo and other Chinese social media platforms since the Netflix adaptation’s release on March 21. As the show continues to dominate Netflix ratings globally, many English-language media outlets have begun covering the “ polarised ” discussion on Chinese social media around the show — perhaps painting the situation as more complicated than it is. On Weibo, the state-run media account Global Times accused foreign media of inflating the negative reactions to the show in order to foment political drama and make Chinese viewers appear unreasonably nationalist. It could be easy for an audience unfamiliar with Chinese media to assume that the Netflix adaptation is breaking through Chinese government censorship with a brave, controversial stance on the country’s past — but that’s not entirely true. While the government under Xi Jinping has drastically ramped up its restrictions on speech , this doesn’t paint a fully accurate picture of how everyday people in China interact with those restrictions. What’s fascinating about this 3 Body debate is how much it reveals about how Chinese viewers metabolize culture and cultivate their historical awareness. Depictions of nationalistic outrage on Chinese social media are probably being exaggerated The New York Times recently published a news column about it: “Instead of pride and celebration, the Netflix series has been met with anger, sneer and suspicion in China. The reactions show how years of censorship and indoctrination have shaped the public perspectives of China’s relations with the outside world. They don’t take pride where it’s due and take offense too easily. They also take entertainment too seriously and history and politics too lightly.” This is certainly a strong argument, and the author, who has spent years reporting from China, including covering its censorship system before, cites examples of criticisms. But a quick Weibo search for “ 3 body Netflix ” shows that it’s not the whole picture; it’s also easy to find Chinese viewers praising the show and criticizing it in equal parts. For example, one recent post celebrates the way the Netflix version has popularized Liu Cixin’s work and Chinese sci-fi to fans around the world. Another post embeds a British vlogger’s commentary on the flaws with the Netflix adaptation, underscoring that criticism of the show is universal. Most of those criticisms would occur to anyone with a passing understanding of the book. Netflix’s changes make the storyline blander and more inexplicably British, deliberately erasing most of the Chinese characters and relocating the main action to London. The exception to this rule is the subplot surrounding Ye Wenjie, a traumatized scientist who grows up in the shadow of China’s brutal Cultural Revolution. Ye Wenjie is arguably a villain who serves as our primary reference point for understanding China. It’s unsurprising, then, that many Chinese people aren’t happy that an adaptation of a beloved work of Chinese science fiction has erased most of the book’s portrayal of Chinese scientific prowess, relocated the plot to another country, and turned the storyline into something primarily critical of the Chinese government. The Times piece goes on to suggest that Chinese viewers have a dim grasp of what the Cultural Revolution — the violent decade of Mao Zedong’s rule between 1966 and 1976 — did to the country, but an example from the same column of a widely circulated article critical of the era complicates that point. Information about the Cultural Revolution sometimes does circulate — only to then be restricted: Someone on social media recently reposted an old article about Ye Qisong, one of the founders of the study of physics in modern China. In 1967, around the time that the struggle session of the series took place, Mr. Ye, who shared the same family name of the physicist in the opening scene, was detained, beaten and forced to confess crimes he didn’t commit. He went crazy and wandered the streets in Beijing, begging for food and money. The article was circulated widely online before it was censored. This anecdote highlights the complicated relationship between Chinese audiences and their government, which frequently turns thorny despite the best efforts of the CCP to control and censor what media and information citizens have access to. This goes double when it comes to Chinese historical events. Chinese social media influencers regularly amplify and encourage celebration and commemoration of various historical events, but only as they relate to a vision of a unified China, supporting the social and military goals of the CCP. Yet this performed patriotism in no way means that Chinese citizens are unaware of the darker parts of their history; witness one Weibo user who described being stunned and impressed by the opening of the Netflix series, with its historically accurate, unflinching depiction of the Cultural Revolution. Such reactions undercut US-centric media’s tendency to pigeonhole Chinese citizens as brainwashed or unquestioning of CCP dogma. The conflict at the heart of this is arguably China versus its history In all three versions of the story, the brutality of the Cultural Revolution directly impacts the future of humanity through Ye Wenjie. As a child, Ye Wenjie watches her father, a leading physicist, become a victim of the early Communist Party’s anti-science movement. Because of her association with her father, she’s forced to do years of hard labor, then recruited into a top-secret scientific program. She’s betrayed repeatedly by other people, all of whom are acting under the auspices of the government to entrap and/or spy on her. Over time, her disillusionment with humanity grows to a breaking point that leads her to make a fatal decision on behalf of all mankind. In other words, the novel and each of its adaptations are clear about the way the Cultural Revolution persecuted the innocent and spawned decades of generational trauma. But each of them portrays the actual violence slightly differently. The English translation of Cixin’s novel opens with an unforgettable scene in which Ye Wenjie’s father is dragged onto a stage before an incensed crowd of communist supporters, pressured by his wife to renounce basic theories of physics, and then beaten to death for his refusal by a group of overzealous teenage party members — all while a horrified Ye Wenjie watches from the audience. In the original Chinese version of Cixin’s novel, the scene remains entirely the same, but his editor, fearing censorship, asked him to move this section to the middle of the novel rather than the beginning, perhaps hoping that relocating the passage would ameliorate the sting of its criticism. This apparently worked, but when fellow sci-fi writer Ken Liu translated Three-Body into English, Cixin gave him permission to put the passage back at the beginning of the book — which is how millions of readers around the globe experienced it. The Netflix adaptation follows the English version of the novel: Ye Wenjie’s father is violently murdered before our eyes, and this underpins everything else that happens in the drama. The earlier 2023 adaptation from the Chinese streaming service Tencent, however, is an almost page-for-page literal adaptation of the English-language version of the novel in every respect except this one. Instead of showing the public execution of Wenjie’s dad, in the Tencent version, he’s arrested and betrayed by members of his own family, and he still loses his esteemed career as a physicist — but he’s ultimately never executed, and it’s implied instead that he died in ignominy with only Ye Wenjie at his side. This is a stark change that arguably waters down the impact of the book, but we still fully understand that the Cultural Revolution victimized Ye Wenjie and her father; decades later, when other characters learn what she went through, they’re appalled. Both the Tencent and Netflix versions faithfully adapt Ye Wenjie’s later harsh life in the labor camp and the subsequent betrayals she experiences. While the more violent aspects of the regime are often erased, depictions of the bleakness and misguided aims of the Cultural Revolution have become acceptable in Chinese pop culture. For example, last year’s widely acclaimed drama The Youth Memories dealt with the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution on China’s “ lost generation ,” who were deprived of access to education after the communist takeover. The show takes a lightly but overtly critical stance toward the Revolution’s ban on higher education and treats the lifting of the ban as a major social leap forward. The problems of Netflix’s 3 Body Problem have more to do with the Netflixian tendency to make every production feel colorless, flat, and forgettable than with Chinese viewers. A look at Tencent’s version, or at shows like The Youth Memories , can give a much more nuanced idea of how Chinese audiences understand their past. Will you support Vox today?

"2","You might think the new movie Civil War is a warning about America’s deepening political divide. The film’s trailer certainly suggests so , and director Alex Garland seemingly confirmed that was his intent in a recent interview with the Atlantic . For me, a writer who has written a book on democratic decline , this marketing set off major alarm bells. While the United States faces very real threats from extreme polarization and rising political violence , a modern repeat of the Civil War is basically out of the question (especially the film’s version , in which a rebel alliance led by Texas and California confront the federal government). Trying to use such a war to examine how American polarization could collapse our democracy would almost certainly be a doomed enterprise. Thankfully, Civil War is not the film I was led to believe. The movie begins near the end of the conflict, providing little context about how things got so bad in fictional America. There are stray hints — the president (Nick Offerman) is in his third term and has disbanded the FBI — but nothing that could help the viewer understand why the United States collapsed into bloodshed. Contrary to marketing, and perhaps even the director’s intent, Civil War has virtually nothing to say about real-world American politics. But this doesn’t mean the film is a failure — far from it. Once you understand that Civil War isn’t about what you think, you can appreciate it for what it actually is: a searing meditation on what happens when political orders collapse and violence takes on a sinister logic of its own. In doing so, it channels some of the best modern academic research on violence in civil wars. This is your brain on violence Civil War tracks a group of four reporters as they race from the (relative) safety of New York City to Washington, DC, to cover the fall of the president: The combined forces of California and Texas are knocking at the Capitol’s doorstep. Yet there’s no real sense of place or specificity in this narrative. With the exception of a rebel base outside Charlottesville, the towns and cities they pass through have no names. The violence the reporters witness on the road is horrific — we’re talking mass graves, suicide bombings, and torture — but it generally has no clear political motivation or higher purpose. Kirsten Dunst as photojournalist Lee in Civil War . A24 In one scene, a sniper opens fire on the reporters’ car, forcing them to take shelter beside two soldiers he’s also attacked. When the reporters ask the soldiers which side everyone is on, they scoff — explaining that he’s trying to kill them, and that’s all that matters. That scene clarifies what the movie is really about: not how political order collapses into civil war, but what happens to a society after it does. Civil War presents a narrative where war takes on a logic of its own. For some, the need to survive pushes them to act in ways they never would have contemplated otherwise. For others, the collapse in order creates opportunities to act on their very worst impulses — best dramatized in an unforgettable scene in which a bigoted soldier (Jesse Plemons) cruelly interrogates the main characters at gunpoint. Under such conditions, social trust collapses altogether; faith in both institutions and other people can’t survive. Civil War’s treatment of journalism basically fits this theme. The movie’s reporters, led by steely photojournalist Lee (a fabulous Kirsten Dunst), are generally decent people and stellar professionals. But in a world where no one trusts anyone, a truly neutral institution like journalism has no place. Without any legal system or supreme power to appeal to, they’re at the mercy of whatever armed faction they come across — most of whom don’t trust journalists any more than anyone else. In conditions of social breakdown, violence consumes all of what makes a society work. What a fake civil war tells us about real ones Civil War’s grim vision reminded me, more than anything else, of an academic book: The Logic of Violence in Civil Wars by Oxford professor Stathis Kalyvas. The book, a modern classic in the literature on civil conflict, argues that most people overestimate the degree to which patterns of violence in civil wars are driven by ideology or emotions run amok. Instead, Kalyvas argues, individual decisions are often made based on calculations of rational self-interest — starting with survival. vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Today, Explained Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.

For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page . Subscribe Kalyvas’s treatment of the relationship between violence and civilian behavior is particularly noteworthy. As we know from American experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan , winning the support of the local civilian population is critically important in determining who wins a civil war. Drawing on data from the 1940s Greek Civil War , Kalyvas argues that civilians make decisions about cooperation based primarily on perceptions of who is in control of the territory in which they live. Basically, they’re most likely to cooperate if they think that side will have the power to keep them safe and advance their other interests. Civilian cooperation then shapes how combatants use force, as informers tell them where their enemies are hiding or who in the civilian population supports the opposing side. How combatants act on this information in turn shapes civilians’ views, affecting their future decisions to cooperate or not. Violence is, in Kalyvas’s language, a “joint process”: Who lives and who dies is determined by the interplay of civilian and combatant actions, all rooted in perceptions of rational self-interest. This is basically how the world in Civil War works. Characters make choices not about ideology or partisanship, but about how best to advance their interests in a country defined by who’s trying to kill them and who isn’t. I can’t recall a single scene where anyone makes an ideological statement about the nature of the American civil war and why they’re fighting it. Such a film has little to say about contemporary American politics. But the imagery and places may help American audiences connect more easily to the subtler story it’s actually telling: about how people in real-life civil wars make life into hell for the people caught up in them. It is less a film about political polarization, or even the headline-dominating wars in Gaza and Ukraine, than one about the long and bloody counterinsurgency wars that defined the war on terror era. In that respect, Civil War should make Americans think less about our own contemporary problems and more about the suffering we so recently inflicted on others .

"2","A report released earlier this year from the National Clearinghouse Research Center found that higher education is finally experiencing a reversal in enrollment declines for the first time since the pandemic began. In fall 2023, there were about 176,000 more undergraduates enrolled, a 1.2 percent increase over fall 2022’s total enrollment at colleges nationwide. The trend could continue as applications continue to increase . College enrollment began retreating in certain parts of the country after a peak in 2010, so the increase is a welcome change as industry watchers continue to fear “ the enrollment cliff ” — shrinking class sizes year after year that have led to layoffs and consolidation and, ultimately, the shuttering of schools. A variety of factors have driven up enrollment this year: More older students matriculated, certificate and vocational programs at community colleges attracted more pupils, and those who had dropped out in previous years returned to complete their degrees. “The undergraduate enrollment increase is significant. It’s the first time that we have seen this happen in our tracking, which goes back to 2015,” said Jeremy Cohen , a research associate at the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. But as the annual May 1 enrollment deadline nears for many colleges, the tumultuous rollout of the new FAFSA, which has caused massive delays in the admissions schedule for families and schools, could destroy the gains. As of late March, 40 percent fewer first-time filers had completed the FAFSA — it stands for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid — compared with the same time last year, according to the National College Attainment Network , which analyzed new data from the Department of Education. In all, an estimated half a million to 700,000 fewer high school seniors will complete the FAFSA compared to the class of 2023, the NCAN told Inside Higher Education . “It’s bad. There are a lot of words not fit to print to describe how bad the FAFSA rollout has been and the impact that’s going to have on student enrollment,” said Katharine Meyer , a Brookings Institution fellow at the Brown Center on Education Policy. “I remain cautious to see what the fall 2024 [enrollment] numbers look like, to see if [the enrollment gains] are a shift in the trend, or if [2023] just ended up being a nice year.” The debate over whether college is worth the cost is ongoing , and the FAFSA processing delays further complicate it. If students can’t access grants and loans for the coming academic year, college will be out of reach, particularly for low-income students. Ultimately, the promise of financial security — one of the most touted benefits of earning a post-secondary degree — could be elusive for many, especially students who stand to benefit the most from a college degree. Enrollment-dependent institutions will suffer, too. It’s why higher education experts are putting pressure on the Department of Education to fix these errors quickly. “We are urging the department to take immediate steps to address these issues. In the meantime, we are encouraging colleges and universities to be flexible with their enrollment deadlines, so we don’t inadvertently lose students in this process,” said Hironao Okahana , the assistant vice president and executive director of the Education Futures Lab at the American Council on Education, which tracks higher education trends. “We still believe that there is learning that happens at the post-secondary level that develops critical thinking and other aspects that are really important in democratic society, writ large.” “That value proposition itself is still there, and we have work to do as a sector to make sure that those opportunities are provided equitably,” he added. Here’s what we know about enrollment trends and why the FAFSA complications might completely erase any gains this fall. With some colleges set to charge students $100,000 for room, board, and other expenses each year , there’s already a perception, among students and families, that higher education is unaffordable — a reality forcing some students to not attend altogether. Now, the chaotic rollout of the FAFSA has become a new major roadblock. Congress directed the Department of Education to revamp the historically complicated FAFSA form to make it simpler for families to file and get financial aid awards. But the rollout grew disastrous beginning in January after thousands of students reported technical glitches that prevented them from completing the new form. While 40 percent fewer students completed the form this year, 27 percent fewer students submitted the form, according to data released by the Department of Education this week. The submission rate includes forms that still need to be corrected due to a variety of processing errors. After weeks of technical challenges that prevented families from completing the new form, the Department of Education announced that it would begin to transmit tax information to schools. Colleges are supposed to use this information to create financial aid packages for students, but even this step has presented new difficulties. School leaders have reported receiving inaccurate tax information for thousands of applicants. The Department of Education recently announced that 200,000 of the 1.5 million applications that it had sent to schools before March 21 had miscalculation errors. The latest hiccups could delay the admissions process further, well past the typical May 1 enrollment deadline that many schools have already extended. “I expect to see this have a really stark impact on enrollment that will likely be concentrated among community college students, who tend to be lower income, and lower-income students in general,” Meyer said. Community colleges saw the biggest enrollment increases last fall, adding 118,000 students — a 2.6 percent gain over the prior year, according to the National Clearinghouse report. Older students, those ages 21 and above who enrolled as first-year students, drove the enrollment increase. Community colleges that offered vocational training and dual-enrollment programs attracted more students, reversing pandemic declines. But the FAFSA complications could shift where students choose to go to school as they think through what they can afford, Meyer said. This means more students could opt for affordable options that might not meet their academic needs. Other students may choose to forgo college entirely. Students who plan to enroll as first-year students aren’t the only group who stand to be affected. “While much attention has focused on how this will impact first-time students and enrollment of new college classes, which it undoubtedly will, the effects on current students should not be overlooked,” said Cohen. “Because students who rely on financial aid need to fill out the FAFSA every year, delays or uncertainty in aid packages could lead to students who might otherwise continue their education stopping out instead.” Enrollment-dependent institutions are also vulnerable. “There are institutions where the difference of 100 students is actually the difference between staying open and closing,” said Meyer. “There are students who are already enrolled in these precarious institutions that could only end up closing in the next year or two because of this.” Wisconsin’s Northland College, which enrolls around 526 students, recently declared financial exigency due to declining enrollment and rising costs and is deciding whether to close. The College of Saint Rose in Albany, New York, announced it would close at the end of the 2023–24 academic year due to enrollment “caused by both a shrinking pool of high school graduates and the prolonged negative impact of COVID-19,” which made it struggle to manage operating expenses. “In the long run, I think there’s every hope and expectation that this FAFSA simplification will deliver on its promise to get more low-income students into college,” said Meyer. “But the class of 2024 is being rocked really hard.” Will you support Vox today?

"2","One of the most fascinating and frightening incidents in computer security history started in 2022 with a few pushy emails to the mailing list for a small, one-person open source project. A user had submitted a complex bit of code that was now waiting for the maintainer to review. But a different user with the name Jigar Kumar felt that this wasn’t happening fast enough. “Patches spend years on this mailing list,” he complained . “5.2.0 release was 7 years ago. There is no reason to think anything is coming soon.”. A month later, he followed up: “Over 1 month and no closer to being merged. Not a suprise.” [sic] And a month after that: “Is there any progress on this?” Kumar stuck around for about four months complaining about the pace of updates and then was never heard from again. A few weeks ago, the world learned a shocking twist. “Jigar Kumar” does not seem to exist at all. There are no records of any person by that name outside the pushy emails. He — along with a number of other accounts — was apparently part of a campaign to compromise nearly every Linux-running computer in the world. (Linux is an open source operating system — as opposed to closed systems from companies like Apple — that runs on tens of millions of devices .) That campaign, experts believe, was likely the work of a well-resourced state actor, one who almost pulled off an attack that could have made it possible for the attackers to remotely access millions of computers, effectively logging in as anyone they wanted. The security ramifications would have been huge. How to (almost) hack everything Here’s how events played out: In 2005, software engineer Lasse Collin wrote a series of tools for better-compressing files (it’s similar to the process behind a .zip file). He made those tools available for free online, and lots of larger projects incorporated Collin’s work, which was eventually called XZ Utils . Collin’s tool became one part of the vast open source ecosystem that powers much of the modern internet. We might think that something as central to modern life as the internet has a professionally maintained structure, but as an XKCD comic published well before the hack shows, it’s closer to the truth that “all modern digital infrastructure” rests on “a project some random person in Nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining since 2003.” XZ Utils was one such project — and yes, you should find it a little worrying that there are many of them. Starting in 2021, a user going by the name “Jia Tan” — he, too, doesn’t seem to exist anywhere else — started making contributions to the XZ project. At first, they were harmless small fixes. Then, Tan started submitting larger additions. The way an open source project like this one works is that a maintainer — Collin, in this case — has to read and approve each such submission. Effectively, Tan was overloading Collin with homework. That’s when “Kumar” showed up to complain that Collin was taking too long. Another account that doesn’t seem to exist joined the chorus. They argued that Collin clearly wasn’t up to the task of maintaining his project alone and pushed for him to add “Jia Tan” as another maintainer. “It seems likely that they were fakes created to push Lasse to give Jia more control,” engineer Russ Cox writes in a detailed timeline of the incident . “It worked. Over the next few months, Jia started replying to threads on xz-devel authoritatively about the upcoming 5.4.0 release.” He’d become a trusted “maintainer” who could add code to XZ Utils himself. Why does any of this matter? Because one of the many, many open source tools that happened to incorporate XZ Utils was OpenSSH, which is used to remotely access computers and is used by millions of servers around the world . “Tan” carefully added to XZ Utils some well- disguised code that compromised OpenSSH, effectively allowing the creators to log in remotely to any computer running OpenSSH. The files containing the (heavily disguised) code were accepted as part of the larger project. Fortunately, almost all of the millions of potentially targeted computers were not affected because it’s routine for such a new update to first be released as “unstable” (meaning expected to have some bugs), and most administrators wait for a subsequent “stable” release. Before that happened, “Jia Tan”’s work got caught. Andres Freund, a software engineer at Microsoft, was off work and doing some testing on a computer that had the “unstable” new release. Under most circumstances, the hack ran seamlessly, but under the circumstances he was testing in, it slowed down SSH performance. He dug deeper and quickly unraveled the whole scheme . Which means that, thanks to one Microsoft engineer doing some work off-hours, your computer remains secure — at least, as far as I know. Can we do better than getting lucky? There was nothing inevitable about this hack getting discovered. Lots of other people were running the unstable new build without noticing any problems. What made Freund suspicious in the first place wasn’t the suspicious code but a bug that had been accidentally introduced by “Jia Tan.” If the “Jia Tan” team had avoided that error, they might well have pulled this off. Catching the suspicious code “really required a lot of coincidences,” Freund said later on Mastadon . No one wants to believe that modern computer security essentially relies on “a lot of coincidences.” We’d much rather have reliable processes. But I hope this narrative makes it clear just how hard it is to reliably defend the jury- rigged internet we have against an attack like this. The people behind “Jia Tan” spent more than two years building the access they needed for this attack. Some of the specifics have to do with the dynamics of open source software, where decades-old projects are often in a quiet maintenance stage from which, as we saw, an aggressive actor can seize control. But with the same resources and dedication that were behind “Jia Tan,” you could get hired at a software company to pull off the same thing on closed-source software too. Most of all, it’s very hard to guess whether this attempted attack was unprecedented or unusual simply in that it got caught. Which means we have no idea whether there are other land mines lurking in the bowels of the internet. Personally, as someone who doesn’t work in computer security, the main thing I took away from this was less a specific policy prescription and more a sense of awe and appreciation. Our world runs on unsung contributions by engineers like Collin and Freund, people who spend their free time building stuff, testing stuff, and sharing what they build for the benefit of everyone. This is inconvenient for security, but it’s also really cool. I wasn’t able to reach Collin for comment. (His website said : “To media and reporters: I won’t reply for now because first I need to understand the situation thoroughly enough. It’s enough to reload this page once per 48 hours to check if this message has changed.”) But I hope he ultimately comes to think that being personally targeted by this fairly extraordinary effort to make his work on XZ utils feel inadequate is, in fact, a remarkable vindication of its importance.

"2","Recently, psychologist Maytal Eyal has observed what she calls an “epidemic of self-hatred.” Both within her work as a therapist and in her wider community, Eyal noticed how the weight of self-criticism and self-loathing wears on people’s souls. “It’s become sort of normalized,” she says. “And when people feel that way, they want to buy products to self-improve.” A consequence of the cultural obsession with self-improvement is the hyperfixation on the self. From elaborate skin care regimens to the culling of “toxic” friends from your social circle , some will go through extreme lengths in the name of self- preservation and betterment. However, we’ve collectively overcorrected when it comes to the impulse to self-correct. When there’s always a new ideal to strive toward, a new workout to try, a new home renovation project, a new way to hack bodily functions, it can be hard to feel adequate, sufficient, enough. Very real socioeconomic, racial, and health factors impact a person’s ability to feel fulfilled, too. When a society marginalizes people based on their income, background, or abilities, it’s extremely easy to feel like we don’t measure up. Do you have a question or idea for Even Better? Submit it by filling out this form . Regardless of your financial circumstances, living situation, or mental and physical health, inescapable psychological functions motivate us to strive for more. Taken too far, these compelling responses can also lead to overconsumption. The barrage of modern marketing and social media-driven comparison only furthers the desire to, well, desire. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to better your life, but there are ways to counter the innumerable pressures — both internal and external — urging you to spend or labor or improve to reach your full potential. Why good things never feel satisfying for long While all animals are compelled to survive, we as humans may be unique in the lengths to which we’ll go to better that existence. The motivating drive that tells us to seek out food when we’re hungry or to find shelter when it’s raining is primed to find other creative life upgrades. A non-peer reviewed study found that when people were asked how certain objects and experiences, like their phone, their pets, and love, could be different, they consistently thought of ways these devices, creatures, and emotions could be better. “The reason why we went from hunting and gathering to living in skyscrapers is because someone had to imagine all of the improvements,” says the study’s co-author Adam Mastroianni , an experimental psychologist and author of the science newsletter Experimental History . “It really does seem to be something very intrinsic in the way that humans work and that they’re always imagining how things can be better than they are right now.” There is likely no limit to what people could dream of improving, Mastroianni says, considering how they imagined ways of bettering the experience of love: “They’re like, ‘Oh, there could be more of it,’” Mastroianni says. What allows us to strive for more is our ability to constantly adapt. Known as the hedonic treadmill or hedonic adaptation, we have an incredible capacity to acclimate to both positive and negative life events, settling at a base level of satisfaction after objectively good and not-so-good things happen. Hedonic adaptation is why buying a new car feels spectacular for a few weeks and then gradually less so until we realize we need something else to spark ecstasy again. Perhaps accidentally, a niche population of dopamine fasters recognized the phenomena of hedonic adaptation and denied themselves stimulating or enjoyable experiences as a means of staving off habituation for more mundane experiences. Another factor that fuels our wants and desires is comparison. Not only do we compare ourselves to others, weighing our success and happiness against theirs, but we can juxtapose our current circumstances with what we could want in the future, says Rachit Dubey , a postdoctoral research fellow at MIT Sloan School of Management. Paired together, hedonic adaptation and comparison mean the goalposts are constantly shifting. Achieving the goal or purchasing the item is just the start of the cycle. When the novelty wears off, we look for the next thing that might bring us self-actualization. Maybe our coworker or best friend or neighbor has that next thing. “Then you go on to get that new, next shiny thing,” Dubey says. “Then you get habituated to it, then you do some more comparisons, and then you want something else. So this is the cycle of habituation and comparisons that can lead to this drive of always wanting more.” This cycle of longing almost never feels good. In a study , Dubey and his colleagues programmed virtual robots he calls agents to act like humans, meaning they got used to positive rewards they received and compared themselves to other agents. Habituation and comparison allowed the agents to achieve more in their virtual world, up to a certain point, “but at the cost of their internal happiness,” Dubey says. If the agent’s aspiration levels were left unchecked, their performance actually diminished. There isn’t much that differentiates having a goal and seeing each accomplishment as a step toward a larger pursuit, Dubey says. Because social comparison can motivate people to get a promotion or buy a mansion, there is little preventing us from constantly striving for more if we’ve already had success on a smaller scale. Even the most well-meaning goals can be taken too far, like turning a joyful hobby into a soul-sucking side hustle . Wanting more in a modern world The instinct to improve our circumstances is a functional one in a society where resources are scarce. The problem arises when those who objectively already have enough — and ample time and money — are constantly marketed endless goods and opportunities. Then, habituation and comparison fuels unhappiness, Dubey says. Having enough money to cover necessities and conveniences is shown to make people happy, research shows , but earning much beyond that may be detrimental to life satisfaction. “People can go from miserable to fine fairly easily,” Mastroianni says. “It’s going from fine to great that gets really hard.” In the pursuit of “fine” to “great,” we chase products. Through no fault of our own, we fall prey to messaging from social media users , algorithms , and expert marketers , urging us that this shampoo or this rug will shift the scales toward enoughness . “This is how the marketplace continues to work,” says Brooke Erin Duffy , an associate professor of communication at Cornell University, “which is by amplifying our inadequacies and insecurities.” Baked into these social platforms is a natural ecosystem for comparison. In the past, people weighed themselves against celebrities in the media and those within their immediate social circles, Duffy says. Now, we can compare ourselves to the idealized version of millions of strangers online — who may be perpetuating an aesthetic trend inspiring us to buy in order to participate. Where we falter is believing that more money, more things, better things, better selves will ultimately make us happy. “We’re obsessed with buying the serum so our skin looks really good, we’re obsessed with getting the new piece of equipment so that our body looks really good,” Eyal, the psychologist, says. “But we sort of lost the plot.” In one sense, the quest for self-optimization may be a means of asserting control over our lives when war , climate change , and political polarization wreak havoc around us, she says. All the wanting, though, leads to overconsumption, Dubey says. The hedonic treadmill has implications beyond individual happiness: Attempting to fill an imagined (often by a savvy advertiser) void with more products or swapping out perfectly adequate tech for the newest version taxes our already fragile planet . Dubey argues that we can strive for a better life, for something more, without consuming. How to get off the hedonic treadmill Feeling enough and having goals are not mutually exclusive. Goal-setting is shown to increase performance and motivation, research shows . However, “not all goals are created equal,” says Tal Ben-Shahar , the founder of the Happiness Studies Academy and a professor at Centenary University. Instead of setting goals based on accumulating things, we should work toward personal growth and development, Ben-Shahar says. This requires deep introspection to determine what we value. If we don’t stop to consider what we want out of life and wind up following the status quo as a result, we may become focused on fulfilling someone else’s idea of success. Determine whether a goal adds to happiness or detracts from it, Ben-Shahar says, whether it is truly attainable or out of reach, and whether it is something we actually want or something we observed someone else achieve. These may not be easy questions to answer, but they’re worth considering. Another mindset shift involves moving away from feeling like we are at a deficit, Mastroianni says. If we perceive our starting point to be below baseline, we’ll never climb out of that hole. This line of thinking assumes those who have different jobs than we do, or who live in different locations than us, or don’t have the social connections we do cannot live full lives, he says. “I ask myself this question a lot,” Mastroianni says, “if I don’t get to live a life that I think is valuable, who does? Who has more than me?” To gain more perspective, many experts and researchers suggest expressing gratitude and appreciation for what we already have. Gratitude prevents us from habituating to the new car or the new job or the new relationship, Ben-Shahar says. Taking a few minutes over dinner or before bed to share or to journal about what we’re grateful for reminds us of all the ways we’re enough, instead of how we don’t measure up. “To avert the impact of hedonic adaptation, we continue to appreciate,” Ben- Shahar says, “so that we can experience both mindful and heartfelt connection to whatever it is that we’re appreciating.” Considering how habituation and comparison function — and how the culture of consumption ratchets up those experiences — it’s hardly surprising how difficult it is to feel satisfied. But, according to Ben-Shahar, it would serve us well to find the balance between appreciation and aspiration . “Good enough,” he says, “really is good enough.” Will you support Vox today?

"1","O .J. Simpson acted as a transracial figure prior to June of 1994. Post–June 1994, he acted as a racially polarizing figure who did more to stoke resentments against African Americans than any other person. Some African Americans, angered over the not guilty verdicts for the white policeman who clubbed Rodney King in the same city a few years earlier, regarded it as cosmic justice that Simpson got away with murdering two white people. Many whites wondered why some of their black countrymen hated them so much as to allow an obviously guilty murderer to walk, and others viscerally cheered such an unjust verdict. Some whites started to fantasize about something like this happening to the Juice. The case pulled a mask off to reveal another inconvenient truth. We loved Bill Cosby and Jared from Subway once, too. Simpson possibly struck us as the first cautionary tale that the pixelated image sold to America differed profoundly from reality. One cannot say O.J. Simpson started cable news’s 24-hour feeding frenzy. Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, that girl who fell into the well in Texas, and Joey Buttafuoco dragged us there first. But in doing that to the culture, after doing that to Ron and Nicole and before bequeathing us Keeping Up with the Kardashians , O.J. left a tabloid-and-trash-tv legacy that more than undid the stellar legacy he built on the gridiron and silver-screen prior to June of 1994. He helped make the 1990s the trashiest decade. Rest in peace. Subscribe to The American Spectator to receive the entirety of Dan Flynn’s Spectator A.M. newsletter. READ MORE from Daniel J.

"1","I n June 2022, the Supreme Court decided three blockbuster constitutional cases. The ones you have surely heard about are Dobbs and Bruen , which, respectively, reversed Roe v. Wade and dramatically expanded Second Amendment gun rights. The third was an establishment of religion clause decision, Kennedy v. Bremerton School District . It made far fewer headlines than did Dobbs and Bruen . It deserves much attention nonetheless, for in it the court announced a revolutionary turn in how it would view questions of religion and public life. Kennedy concerned a public high school football coach’s practice of praying briefly on the field after each game. He did not invite anyone to join him. But join him they did, especially the players he coached. The spectacle drew the unfavorable attention of school authorities, who thought it amounted to a public adoption of the Christian religion, in violation — they further thought — of the First Amendment’s ban on religious “establishments.” (Coach Kennedy was and is a convinced Christian.) Kennedy lost his job when he refused to abandon his post-game ritual. The Supreme Court first considered school prayer as possibly unconstitutional in 1962, when it threw out (in the case of Engle v. Vitale ) a teacher-led nondenominational invocation that students were not required to join. The court has taken up school prayer in other contexts several times since, the results of which have varied. The opinions in these cases, however, have been invariably unsatisfying, and often incoherent. In Kennedy , Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority that the court’s longstanding doctrinal approach to school prayer cases — as well as to all establishment clause questions — was too “abstract, and ahistorical.” Gorsuch announced that the court was “abandon[ing]” the “ Lemon ” test. (This test was called “ Lemon ” not because it doesn’t work well, although that is true, but rather after the 1971 case that minted it, Lemon v. Kurtzman .) All too briefly, that set of standards required each government action to have a “secular” purpose, avoid effectively advancing religion, and steer clear of “excessive entanglements” between public authorities and religion. No doubt the Lemon test had to go, if only because (as we shall soon see) it was deeply at odds with the founding and the whole constitutional tradition up until around World War II. Judges and lawyers and professors had moved from criticizing Lemon to lamenting it and then, finally, to lampooning it. Justice Antonin Scalia, more than thirty years ago, wrote that “like some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed and buried, Lemon stalks our establishment clause jurisprudence once again, frightening the little children and school attorneys.” The commentary had grown more caustic in the decades since. Henceforth, it was to be all history all the time. The Kennedy Court wrote that the establishment clause must instead be interpreted by “‘reference to historical practices and understandings.’… ‘[T]he line’ that courts and governments ‘must draw between the permissible and the impermissible’ has to ‘accor[d] with history and faithfully reflec[t] the understanding of the Founding Fathers.’” The justices propose to ride bareback across the early national era, checking to see what the founders thought and did about specific “church–state” issues — like legislative prayer, public support of religious schools, oaths, and public religious monuments. This article is taken from The American Spectator’s latest print magazine. Subscribe to receive the entire magazine. Some good outcomes would be obtained in establishment clause cases if the court seriously engaged with the founders’ “practices and understandings.” To do so, however, the court will have to confront, disentangle, and correct an unforced error it made decades ago. It is a mistake that impenetrably blocks the justices from understanding the founders’ “understanding,” for central to that “understanding” is the inestimable place of natural religion — truths about divine realities that reason can grasp without resort to revelation — in it. Wrapping one’s mind around the salience of natural religion is essential to “understanding” the “practices” of the founders for four reasons. First, and as historian Owen Anderson aptly wrote, “The United States was founded on natural religion.” From the beginning of our existence as one country (and even before, for that matter) public authorities across the land forthrightly affirmed the truths of natural religion. The “Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” emboldened the revolutionaries in Philadelphia. Before and after the founding, civil governments in America affirmed truths such as God’s eternal existence and creation of all that there is; God’s providential care for humankind, including promulgation of the moral law for guidance of human affairs; and some form of the afterlife in which the guilty suffered and the virtuous prospered, or what the founders almost always rendered as a “future state of rewards and punishments.” In the Declaration of Independence, our founders declared, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Nearly two centuries later, in the 1963 Bible-reading- in-public-schools case School District of Abington Township v. Schempp , the Supreme Court said that the “fact that the Founding Fathers believed devotedly that there was a God and the inalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their writings, from the Mayflower Compact to the Constitution itself.” When public authority affirmed that there is a God in the national motto (“In God We Trust”) or in the Pledge of Allegiance (“one nation under God), or as did Lincoln throughout his Second Inaugural, lawmakers did not abandon a proper concern for the common good of the polity. Yes, some would say today that affirming the truths of natural religion would be an unalloyed religious act, without any proper “secular” purpose at all. Not so. For one thing, the tenets of natural religion — true propositions about divine realities and the connections between those realities and humankind that can be known through the use of unaided reason — are really truths of philosophy , not religion. They are no more mysterious or dreamy or impractical and no less metaphysical (if you will) than our nation’s founding beliefs in human equality or inalienable rights. Art by Bill Wilson Besides, the founders did not forsake “secular” law-making purposes when they affirmed natural truths about divine things. In fact, they did not use the term “secular” when they discussed religion and the polity. They knew that there was this world (of time and space and suffering) and that there was a subsequent very different world of final universal justice. Death marked a passage between the two. But that did not establish a hard boundary, in either thought or action, between the “secular” and the “religious.” For the founders, the border between the two realms was porous, with lots of traffic to and fro. God reigned in both worlds. God revealed Himself in the heavens and to the minds of the prophets and in the public ministry of Jesus. God gave to humankind a natural moral law “written on the heart,” according to the apostle Paul. The standard meaning of “secular,” however, is the absence of God, or at least living as if there were no God. This “secularism” was just not part of the founders’ world. The Founding Fathers firmly believed that governmental care for religion, including public witness to the existence of a Creator God who providentially guides human affairs, was part of the temporal common good. If the founders were pressed further to articulate this arrangement, they likely would have said that religion is a distinct and incommensurate part of human experience, and that public authority has a limited but still important duty to foster religion. There was nothing meaningfully “secular” about it. The second reason to understand natural religion in the founders’ worldview is that it enables us to appreciate the distinction they drew between it and the particularities of the various “sects.” Before and after 1776, anyone could see that the many churches and religious groups were distinguished one from the other mainly by what each added to natural religion. Some of these additions were matters thought to have been revealed by God to humankind, chiefly by and through divine communication with the prophets and, then, in the public ministry of Jesus of Nazareth. Others were humanly established conventions and rules, accouterments of religious living, both solo and in community. Therefore, one could — and the founders did — contrast “natural religion” with “revealed” and “positive” religion. The founders wisely judged that their polity could flourish without enforced unanimity about, or a top-down settlement of, these questions. The common good did not require, for example, that the government show favor to a particular form of liturgy. Nor did it necessitate authoritative adoption of any one church’s creed. Theologians might contend over the details of faith and worship, but the lawmaker adhered to an authoritatively stipulated incompetence when it came to matters of religious doctrine, church discipline, modes of worship, and manner of a religious community’s internal governance. The truth or falsity of these matters — even recognizing that they were the kinds of things that could be true or false — was strictly beyond the ken of public authority. This was the original understanding of the establishment clause. As the Supreme Court expressed it in one nineteenth-century case: “The law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establishment of no sect.” Just so — and none of it touches the central, public place of natural religion in the founders’ “understandings” and “practices.” The court smudged that distinction right after World War II and obliterated it in the 1960s. The justices treated matters as different as pronouncing ours a nation “under God” and giving, say, the Episcopal Church exclusive government patronage as indistinguishably, univocally “religious.” Thus did the court render invisible (to the justices, at least) the distinction essential to grasping the original understanding of the establishment clause. The third reason it is important to understand natural religion according to the founders is that it restores to the religious question open-minded reasoning based upon evidence and argument. The court has for many decades regularly described religion as a noncognitive, subjective, and even fantastical enterprise. The most emblematic statement of this unfortunate descent into religion-as-superstition is from the 1981 case Thomas v. Review Board , in which the court declared that “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others” to merit constitutional protection. There is a sense in which that improbable observation fits into a sound legal train of thought. But my reference to it here illustrates what the court has steadily maintained for many decades: when you enter the realm of religion, you have left behind the realm of reason. Fourth, there was no more widespread conviction among the founding generation than that they lived in a morally ordered universe; thus, the founders recognized the “Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God.” Even the most skeptical among them (such as the quasi-deist Thomas Jefferson) never doubted that there was a transcendent source of meaning and value for human actions. The balance of natural religion — monotheism, human equality, and so on — supplied the additional premises to conclude, with confidence and based upon reason, that there was an objective, universal moral law, and that there was an end to it. Our Supreme Court declared in a 1992 abortion case ( Planned Parenthood v. Casey ) that the “heart of [constitutional] liberty” was the right of everyone to make up his or her (or, today, their or its) own mental and moral universe. This acidic subjectivism cum solipsism is not only a cancerous growth on our body politic. It is an utter repudiation of all that the founders thought and practiced. Gerard V.

"2","On April 11, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report containing new information about this year’s spate of measles cases. As of April 11, 121 measles cases have been identified so far in the US this year across 18 jurisdictions. That number should shock you: In a typical year, the US has only around 5 cases in the first quarter. The total for 2024 so far is more than twice the number of cases the country saw in the entirety of 2023, when 58 cases were reported over the full calendar year. The authors of the latest report credited the United States’ effective measles monitoring system as a critical factor in enabling public health officials to catch and contain measles cases when they’ve popped up — at least, so far. According to the report, the increase has been so explosive that it threatens to flip the US from being a country where measles is considered eliminated (no longer spread locally) to being one where measles is considered endemic (something that infects people on a regular basis). It’s been nearly 25 years since measles was officially eliminated in the US. But the declaration didn’t mean measles could never come back: Under certain conditions — lots of cases imported from abroad, not enough people vaccinated against the infection, and not enough tools to fight back — measles could re-entrench itself stateside. That’s why public health authorities monitor measles cases and vaccination rates against the infection so closely. And why, when cases rise while vaccination rates drop, they fret. Measles is a viral infection that causes fever, rash, and cough, which can be complicated by severe, life-threatening infections of the ears, lungs, and brain. It’s particularly likely to cause severe disease in children under 5 years old and in immunocompromised people. To make matters worse, it’s one of the most contagious diseases out there: Infectious particles can hang out in the air or on surfaces for hours , and, on average, each infected person infects another 12 to 18 people . When measles turns up in the US, it’s because it was brought to the country from the outside — more often than not, by US residents returning from travel abroad. There’s a lot of measles in the world; in 2022, the infection caused more than 9 million cases and killed more than 136,000 people globally, most of them children. Although countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia currently top the list of measles cases globally , there have also been multiple outbreaks in Western Europe over the past year. There’s a highly effective vaccine to prevent measles — but to protect the youngest babies and immunocompromised people in any population, everyone around them needs to have been vaccinated. In the US, pockets of low measles vaccination are a serious concern: 91 percent of patients infected in the US between 2020 and late March 2024 were unvaccinated or of unknown vaccination status. Key strategies for preventing a measles conflagration here include giving unvaccinated people MMR shots (so called because they protect against measles, mumps, and rubella) before they travel and rapidly investigating suspected measles cases, said the report. For now, people can do something about the current US measles situation if they know how and understand the stakes. Here’s what you need to know. 1) Who’s at highest risk from a measles infection, and what does an infection look like? Unvaccinated children and immunocompromised people — especially those receiving certain cancer treatments — face the highest risk when measles is in circulation. “Even an uncomplicated case of measles is really awful,” said Sarah Lim, an infectious disease doctor and medical specialist at the Minnesota Department of Health, during a press conference on March 12. Measles infections are so often severe that about one in five unvaccinated people who get infected are hospitalized, and between one and three of every 1,000 measles infections end in death. In its early stages, measles infection can cause a range of symptoms, including high fevers, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and full-body rash. About one-third of infected kids experience complications, which can include severe diarrhea, ear infections, and pneumonia. Brain infection that can lead to brain damage and epilepsy, called encephalitis, occurs in about one of every 1,000 kids who get infected with measles. Measles can also do something else that few other infections are known to do: It can wipe out kids’ immune memory , leaving them unprotected from other bacterial and viral pathogens. That effect, and the increased susceptibility to other infections that comes with it, can last for years after infection. Travel to parts of the world where measles circulates widely increases the risk of infection. That makes it important to ensure you and your family are protected from measles — in addition to all the other things — prior to travel. 2) How is this year’s measles outbreak in the US different from past outbreaks? The biggest number of measles cases the US has seen over the past 25 years was in 2019 , when nearly 1,300 infections were reported over the course of the year. Nine out of every 10 of these cases occurred among unvaccinated people living in close-knit communities. A single outbreak in an Orthodox Jewish community in New York involved 649 cases ; another outbreak involving 71 cases occurred in a Washington state community of recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union. What’s different so far about this year’s US measles cases is that they’re occurring in “lots of little sparks across the nation,” as epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina put it in a March edition of her newsletter . “The more embers, the more likely it is that they find unvaccinated pockets and spread like wildfire,” she wrote. The CDC’s April 11 report noted that over the past four years, the typical US measles case has been younger than in previous years — 3 years old compared to 5 years old in the first four months of 2019, the year of that last big outbreak. The report also noted 63 percent of index cases — that is, cases imported from measles-endemic countries — had occurred in US residents returning from travel abroad. That’s fewer than in early 2019, when 77 percent of imported cases were in residents. This year’s uptick is happening at a time when a relatively large proportion of kids are going unvaccinated against measles. In a November 2023 publication, CDC scientists reported that roughly 7 percent of kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles during the 2022–2023 school year. At the same time, vaccine exemptions reached an all-time high, exceeding 5 percent of kids in 10 states. To make matters worse, according to recent reporting in the LA Times, a lot of parents are choosing to delay measles vaccination in their infants, which increases vulnerability to the most severe effects of measles in a group that’s already at the highest risk of complications. The World Health Organization (WHO) cautions that the risk of a measles outbreak increases dramatically if more than 5 percent of people in a community aren’t vaccinated, which makes these numbers pretty concerning. What’s even more alarming is that they are averages: In some states, as many as 22 percent of people are unvaccinated, and that number is likely much higher in some smaller geographic pockets. “That’s where you’re really talking about throwing a match [into a pile of kindling] and having a large fire,” said Jane Zucker, an infectious disease doctor and epidemiologist who retired in 2023 after 30 years in public health, including more than 20 with the New York City health department’s Bureau of Immunization, when I spoke with her in March. “That’s what you’re really most anxious about.” 3) Who should get vaccinated, revaccinated, or tested for immunity? There’s no medicine to treat measles infection once it’s taken hold, which makes prevention the main strategy for avoiding the virus’ worst effects. The best news about measles — and the reason most of us have no idea what it looks like — is that the MMR vaccine that prevents it is extremely effective and safe. That vaccine is what experts call a “ live-attenuated ” vaccine. That means it’s made using a weakened version of the measles virus that can’t actually cause the disease. Because they so closely replicate the actual virus, these kinds of vaccines induce the strongest and longest-lasting response of any type of vaccine — including Covid-19 vaccines. MMR vaccines are 97 percent effective at preventing symptomatic measles infections. These vaccines can even protect people after they’re exposed to measles if they’re given within 72 hours of exposure, and they’re extraordinarily safe . Who should get vaccinated against measles? Babies (lifelong immunity comes after two shots, the first at 12 months old and the second at 4 to 6 years of age) and almost everyone else who doesn’t have proof that they’ve been vaccinated before should get vaccinated, according to the CDC . That’s especially true if those people without vaccination proof work in health care or are about to travel to places where there’s lots of measles in circulation — which these days includes Europe, Zucker said. Babies 6 to 12 months should also get an MMR shot if they’re going to be traveling; because their immune systems aren’t mature enough at that age for the vaccine to “take,” they’ll still need another two-shot series after their first birthday. Many adults who’ve already been vaccinated won’t ever need another measles vaccine. That’s because all the versions of measles vaccines in use since 1968 have been strong enough to give lifelong protection against infection. So long as you’re certain you’ve had two vaccines in the years since then — that is, it’s documented somewhere in your medical record that you got them — you don’t need a repeat. The exception is for adults who only got vaccinated between 1963 and 1967: Because the version used during those years was too weak to give lifelong immunity, they’re not considered protected unless they’ve gotten at least one dose of a newer version of the vaccine. Another group that doesn’t need to worry about vaccination is most adults over 65. Measles was so common before the vaccine was available that experts assume people born in those years were exposed and are immune. So if you were born before 1957, you don’t need a vaccine unless you’re in a high- risk situation — for example, you work in health care or you’re about to travel to a place where there’s a lot of measles in circulation. There are some people who should wait to get an MMR vaccine if they’re unvaccinated or if their vaccine history isn’t clear. Live vaccines like this one are typically not recommended for people with weakened immune systems, which include pregnant folks and some immunocompromised people. Some other conditions make it sensible to hold off on vaccination — have a look at the answers to “Who Should Not Get MMR Vaccine?” on the CDC website and talk to a health care provider if you’re not sure what to do. A blood test called a measles serology can measure the level of measles antibodies in a person’s blood. If the level is high, it’s safe to assume that person is immune to measles, as a result of either vaccination or past infection. But low scores on these tests may not be very meaningful, said Zucker: Many people with low levels of measles antibodies actually have measles protection due to prior vaccination, making it a bad test for determining whether immunizations documented a long time ago are still providing protection. For that reason, the CDC says a history of vaccination supersedes a serology result when it comes to determining whether a person is protected from measles. Health experts sometimes administer these tests in outbreak settings and during pregnancy, but the results are typically used in ways specific to those scenarios. So you don’t need a serology to prove you’re vaccinated if the shots are documented in your medical record — and in any case, it’s harmless to get a repeat vaccination even if you’ve been vaccinated before. “If you don’t know if you’re immune,” said Zucker, “it’s easier to just get yourself vaccinated.” 4) How bad is this outbreak likely to get? Where US measles cases go is really up to us. There’s hope for controlling measles’ damage in the US if more parents opt to vaccinate their babies as soon as they’re eligible, if they keep unvaccinated kids home from school, and if they vaccinate their unvaccinated children as soon as they hear about a potential exposure. It’ll also help if public health authorities have adequate support and staffing to educate the public about measles, provide and document vaccination — as with immunization registries — and intervene when outbreaks happen. However, last year’s national debt ceiling deal resulted in cuts to states’ child vaccination programs . Furthermore, the wild nonsense on vaccines that pervades social media — and, occasionally, official messaging, as in the case of Florida’s surgeon general — makes it challenging for many parents to disentangle the common-sense guidance from the crap. Joshua Barocas, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Colorado, said during the March 12 press conference that pushing back against measles is a team effort and that removing shame from the equation is key. “Parents are flooded with tons of information, some of that [being] misinformation — and so if you are a parent who’s been on the fence, now is the time to catch up on your kids’ delayed vaccines,” he said. “I would also encourage health care workers to welcome people with open, nonjudgmental arms,” Barocas said.

"2","Iran launched a retaliatory strike Saturday night on Israel for its deadly attack on Iranian officers in the Islamic Republic’s embassy in Damascus after days of signaling it would do so. The response came in waves throughout Saturday, beginning with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) seizing a vessel in the Red Sea connected to Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer’s company, Zodiac Maritime. By around 11 pm local time, that had graduated to multiple waves of attack drones and missiles headed toward Israeli targets. The drones — thought to be slow-moving Shahed-136 models — could have been intended to confuse Israeli radar systems and allow missiles to penetrate, but also could have been chosen as a carefully choreographed response intended to telegraph the regime’s anger at Israel’s embassy strike on April 1. The Israeli military said the missile barrage included both ballistic and cruise missiles. The last two weeks and particularly Iran’s attack Saturday have raised fears that finally it — as in, the outright regional war that has been feared ever since Hamas ’s October 7 attacks and Israel’s ensuing invasion of Gaza — is here. And while it’s too early to tell what exactly comes next — including how Israel responds — Iran seems to be signaling it doesn’t want this to escalate further. For one, the country is in no position to ignite a regional war because of its internal economic and security instability and regime vulnerability. But, after years of US and Israeli assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists and military commanders , the regime likely calculated that it had no choice but to respond to the Damascus strike. But an hour after the drone strike, Iran’s permanent mission to the UN wrote on X, formerly Twitter , that, “ The matter can be deemed concluded .” Here’s what we know so far The attack Saturday was an alarming escalation in the long-running tensions between Iran and Israel. Iran has said that it has launched dozens of drones; Israeli military sources said more than 100, according to the Associated Press . Because it took the drones hours to reach Israeli airspace, US, Israeli, and Jordanian forces were prepared to intercept the aircraft (Jordan and several other neighboring countries shut down their airspace Saturday night). At the time of this writing, according to Reuters , the US has shot down an undisclosed number of the drones, and Ha’aretz reported that the ballistic missile phase of Iran’s attack had finished. The US has vowed steadfast support in case of an Iranian attack on Israeli territory, increasing the number of US forces and assets in the region to prepare for such a situation, and the UK has supported the US’s efforts in the region as well . The drones were reportedly headed to the Golan Heights , a region that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War, and the Negev desert, where there are several Israeli military installations and a US base . Israel’s primary nuclear research center and one of its largest air bases are both located in the Golan Heights. Both Israeli and Iranian governments confirmed that Iran had also launched cruise missiles toward Israeli targets, synchronized to hit at the same time the drone swarms reached Israeli airspace. Israel’s air raid alert system sounded warnings across areas of southern Israel including the Negev , as well as the occupied West Bank , Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights , indicating that the Iranian weapons were headed toward their targets. Israeli missile defense systems reportedly intercepted many of them . One person has been reported to be injured so far, according to Israel’s emergency services, and minor damage was caused to an Israeli military base, according to spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. Does this mean a regional war is imminent? A major concern over the past six months of Israel’s war in Gaza following the October 7 Hamas attacks has been whether it will spill into a regional war. Iran’s rhetoric in response to Israel’s invasion of Gaza has been fiery, but until now, the Islamic Republic — which considers Israel an interloper in Muslim lands — has been content to let affiliated groups, like Hezbollah in Lebanon and militias in Iraq and Syria, fight those battles. Hezbollah and Israel frequently trade fire over the southern Lebanese border, which has killed at least 66 Lebanese civilians and approximately nine Israeli civilians, and Iraqi and Syrian militia groups have attacked US installations in both those countries over 150 times in the past six months in response to the US’s continued military support for Israel . Early on in the war, the US sent warships to the region to discourage further escalation. Yemen’s Houthi rebel group has also targeted ships in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait of the Red Sea, claiming to target vessels in retaliation for the Israeli military’s destruction of Gaza and killing of more than 33,000 Palestinians . (Though, as my colleague Joshua Keating has reported , the attacks also serve a number of the Houthis’ other interests.) Then, on April 1, Israel launched an attack on Iran’s embassy in Damascus, Syria, killing multiple IRGC Quds Force commanders, who manage operations for Iran-aligned forces around the region. Embassies are considered to be inviolable , and serious attacks on such premises are rare. Though the Islamic Republic can ill afford an all-out regional war, “they were compelled to do this,” Ali Vaez, director of the International Crisis Group’s Iran program, told Vox. Internal dynamics, including an economy crippled by inflation , sanctions , and corruption ; widespread dissatisfaction with the regime exemplified by the large-scale protest movement after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini; and internal security crises due to the rise of ISIS-Khorasan Province and Baluch separatist groups make war with Israel and the US deeply unappealing for the regime. But for days after the attack on its Damascus embassy, Iran was promising to respond. “The Iranians concluded that the risk of not responding outweighed the risk of responding,” Vaez said. Hardliners within the government — the leadership’s last remaining sector of support — had publicly criticized the lack of response to multiple assassinations and escalatory actions attributed to Israel. Thus far there have been no reports of Israeli deaths. But whether and how Israel will respond remains to be seen. Will you support Vox today?

"2","What’s the point of philosophy? It’s an old question, maybe one of the oldest in the history of philosophy, and there has never been a consensus answer. Some people think the point of philosophy is to make the world make sense, to show how everything hangs together. For others, philosophy is a practical tool that ought to tell us how to live. If you’re in the latter camp, then it’s fair to say that you think of philosophy as a form of self-help. It’s a tradition of thought that — in theory, at least — can guide you to a better life, or something like that. And I don’t think that’s too much to ask of philosophy. What good is all that ruminating if it can’t offer you something useful when you’re anxious or depressed or mired in one of those dreaded midlife crises? Kieran Setiya is a philosopher at MIT and the author of several books, most recently Life Is Hard: How Philosophy Can Help Us Find Our Way and Midlife: A Philosophical Guid e . Setiya’s work is uncommonly accessible and a great example of philosophy that really tries to wrestle with the concrete problems of everyday life. I recently invited Setiya on The Gray Area to talk about the perils of middle age and how philosophy has helped pull us out of the dark. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. As always, there’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Stitcher , or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday. Sean Illing You wrote a book called Life Is Hard . Not that your philosophy of life can be summed up in three words, but if you had to sum it up in three words, is that it? Kieran Setiya I think it is. Ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle thought about the ideal life and they tried to provide a blueprint for — and a map toward — it. And that can be both unrealistic and in a certain way self- punitive. Often the right way to approach the ideal life is to think, “That’s not available. I shouldn’t beat myself up about the fact that that’s not available.” Really living well, or living as well as you can, is about dealing with the ways in which life is hard. Sean Illing How do you define a midlife crisis? Kieran Setiya The midlife crisis is one of those funny cultural phenomena that has a particular date of origin. In 1965, this Canadian psychoanalyst Elliott Jaques writes a paper, “ Death and the Midlife Crisis , ” and that’s the origin of the phrase. Jacques was looking at patients and the lives of artists who experienced midlife creative crises. These were mostly people in their 30s and it doesn’t really fit the stereotype of the midlife crisis today. There’s been a shift in the way people think about the midlife crisis. The idea now is that people’s life satisfaction takes the form of a gentle U-shape , that basically, even if it’s not a crisis, people tend to be at their lowest ebb in their 40s. This is true for men and women, and it’s true around the world to differing degrees, but it’s pretty pervasive. So when people like me talk about the midlife crisis, what they really have in mind is more like a midlife malaise. It may not reach the crisis level, but there seems to be something distinctively challenging about finding meaning and orientation in this midlife period. Sean Illing What is it about this period that generates all this anxiety? Kieran Setiya There are many midlife crises; it’s not just one thing. I think some of them are looking to the past. There’s regret. There’s the sense that your options have narrowed. Whatever possibilities might’ve seemed open to you earlier, whatever choices you’ve made, you’re at a point where there are many kinds of lives that might have been really attractive to you, and now it’s clear in a vivid, material way that you can’t live them. There’s also regret that things have gone wrong in your life, you’ve made mistakes, bad things have happened, and now the project is, “How do I live the rest of my life in this imperfect circumstance?” The dream life is off the table for most of us. People also have a sense that most of life is occupied by this daily grind. Rather than things that make life seem positively valuable, it’s just one thing after another. And then death starts to look like it’s at a distance that you can measure in terms you really palpably understand. You have a sense of what a decade is like, and there’s only three or four left at best. Sean Illing I’m 42 and I can feel all of that. When you’re young, the future is pure potential. Ahead is nothing but freedom and choices. But as you get older, life shrinks, responsibilities pile up, and you get trapped in the consequences of the decisions you’ve made. That’s a hard thing to wrestle with. Kieran Setiya I think that’s exactly right. Part of what’s philosophically puzzling about this is that it’s not news. Whatever your sense of options was when you were 20, you knew you weren’t going to get to do all of those things. What this suggests is that there’s a profound difference between knowing that things might go a certain way, well or badly, and knowing in concrete detail how they went well or badly. Part of the sense of missing out has to do with what philosophers call “incommensurable values.” The idea that if you’re choosing between $50 and $100, you take the $100 and you don’t have a moment’s regret. But if you’re choosing between going to a concert or staying home and spending time with your kid, either way you’re going to miss out on something that is irreplaceable. One of the things we experience in midlife is all the kinds of lives we don’t get to live that are different from our life, and there’s no real compensation for that, and that can be very painful. On the other hand, I think it’s useful to see the flip side. The only way you could avoid that kind of missing out is if the world was suddenly totally impoverished of variety. Or you were so monomaniacal, you just didn’t care about anything but money, for instance. And you don’t really want that. There’s a way in which the sense that there’s so much in the world we’ll never be able to experience is a manifestation of something we really shouldn’t regret, and in fact should cherish, namely the evaluative richness of the world, the diversity of good things. And there’s a consolation in that. Sean Illing One of the arguments you make is how easily we can delude ourselves when we start pining for the roads not traveled. “What if I really went for it? What if I tried to become a novelist, or a musician, or what if I joined that commune?” Or whatever life fantasy you had when you were younger. But if you take that seriously and consider what it really means, you might not like it, because the things you might value the most in your life now, like your children, they don’t exist if you had zigged instead of zagging 15 or 20 years ago. That’s what it means to have lived that alternative life. Kieran Setiya Philosophy can lead us toward this kind of unhelpful abstraction, but it can also tell us what’s going wrong with it. The thought, “I could have had a better life, things could have gone better for me”: It’s almost always tempting and true, but when you think through what it would mean in concrete terms — what would have happened if your failed marriage had not happened? Often the answer is that you would never have had your kid, or wouldn’t have met these people. And you might think, “Yeah, but I would have had some other unspecifiable friends who would have been great, and some other unspecifiable kid who would have been great.” But I think we rightly don’t evaluate our lives just in terms of those kinds of abstract possibilities, but in terms of attachments to particulars. So if you just ask yourself, “Could my life have been better?” you’re throwing away one of the basic sources of consolation, a rational consolation, which is attachment to the particularity of the good things in your own life, even if you acknowledge that they’re not perfect and that there are other things that could have been better. Sean Illing I will say, though, that when real pain strikes, it’s not always easy to find relief in abstract arguments. Two of the hardest moments of my adult life were the sudden loss of my mother a few years ago and the unexpected loss of a baby last year. Like a lot of people, I did that thing where I felt victimized, like the world’s conspiring against me. But then you go through the anger of all that and realize that you’re not uniquely unlucky, that this happens to people every day. Pain and loss are part of life, as central to life as anything else, and good philosophy, whether it’s in academic books or novels or films, can help remind us of that, and I guess it helped me in that way. Kieran Setiya I’m sorry to hear about both of those losses. I think what philosophy has to do is what human beings have to do when faced with those kinds of difficulties, which is not switch too rapidly into what I call assurance advice mode, which is saying, “It’s all going to be fine. Or here’s what you do.” Those are things we do in personal interaction, but they’re also versions of philosophical approaches to the difficulties of life. There’s the kind of theodicy where philosophers argue that all is for the best. They’ve got some proof that although this seems bad, it’s going to work out well. Or they have some theory where they say, “My philosophical principle is this, I’ll just apply it to your situation.” And those are rarely good philosophical tactics for dealing with the kind of difficulties you’re describing, for reasons that are not unrelated to the fact that they’re rarely good interpersonal ways of approaching difficulty. The starting point is sitting with difficulty, acknowledging it, trying to take in what’s really happening, really describing the particularity of it. It’s connected with a kind of philosophical methodology that I have come to embrace. And it’s a shift from thinking, “Well, philosophy is going to be about coming up with really cool arguments to prove you should think this or that,” to thinking, “There’s a real continuity between the literary and human description of phenomena like grief and philosophical reflection.” Because often what philosophical reflection provides is less a proof that you should live this way and more concepts with which to articulate your experience and then structure and guide how you relate to reality. And seen that way, we can understand how philosophy can operate as self-help.

"2","White rural Americans are a “racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay” authoritarian fifth column that poses an existential threat to our republic. Unless they are actually a downtrodden people who rightly resent the condescension of liberal elites and wish for little more than “to preserve a sense of agency over their future and a continuity of their community’s values and social structures.” These are the twin poles of blue America’s current debate over why rural white folks vote the way they do. This argument is as old as the urban-rural divide itself. But the latest round was triggered by White Rural Rage: The Threat to American Democracy , a bestselling book from the political scientist Tom Schaller and journalist Paul Waldman. Schaller and Waldman argue that rural white voters are exceptionally reactionary, racist, and anti-democratic. In their telling, these retrograde impulses turn this group into easy prey for a Republican Party that shutters rural hospitals, denies workers’ health insurance, erodes labor rights — and then says, in so many words, let them eat hate . Many commentators and political scientists have taken exception to this argument. The Atlantic’s Tyler Austin Harper argues that White Rural Rage “illustrates how willing many members of the U.S. media and the public are to believe, and ultimately launder, abusive accusations against an economically disadvantaged group of people that would provoke sympathy if its members had different skin color and voting habits.” In his account, the real threat to American democracy “is not white rural rage, but white urban and suburban rage” — a fact that would be plain to Waldman and Schaller, Harper says, if they’d only paid more careful attention to the studies their book cites. Colby College political scientist Nicholas Jacobs, meanwhile, insists that White Rural Rage’s “simplistic” and inaccurate thesis amounts to little more than “an outpouring of frustration with rural America that might feel cathartic for liberals, but will only serve to further marginalize and demonize a segment of the American population that already feels forgotten and dismissed by the experts and elites.” In my view, this debate has gotten a bit muddled, with each side dancing around inconvenient facts. The argument between White Rural Rage’s champions and its critics would generate more light (and perhaps less heat) if all involved grappled with five important truths: 1) Rural white people are more supportive of right-wing authoritarianism than are urban or suburban ones Harper’s central claim — that rural white people actually pose less of a threat to American democracy than urban and suburban ones — rests on faulty reasoning. His case can be boiled down into three points: A 2021 paper in Journal of Democracy found that “political violence” in the US “has been greatest in suburbs where Asian American and Hispanic American immigration has been growing fastest.” Several high-profile right-wing extremists, including the “pizzagate” gunman, came from areas that aren’t rural, at least by certain definitions of that term. The vast majority of Americans who believe that the 2020 election was stolen — and that Trump would therefore be justified in reclaiming the presidency by force — live in urban areas . These facts establish that white rural Americans are not uniquely right-wing or authoritarian; supporters of Trump and the January 6 Capitol riot can be found in nearly every category of municipality. Harper is right to object to the singling out of white rural voters writ large, when the problem is illiberal reactionaries in every part of the country. Nonetheless, his evidence doesn’t contradict the premise that rural white people are unusually supportive of Donald Trump and January 6. This is a fatal problem for his argument, since Trump is the fundamental threat to American democracy today. All political violence is lamentable, but individual militants cannot undermine the independence of federal law enforcement, the integrity of the electoral process, or the peaceful transfer of power; an insurrectionary president plausibly can. And there is no question that white voters from low-density areas support Trump by much larger margins than their counterparts in high- density places. In the 2020 election, rural white voters backed Trump over Biden by 42 points, while suburban white voters favored him by just 7, according to the Democratic data firm Catalist. Urban white voters, meanwhile, supported Biden over Trump by a 32-point margin. If rural white Americans voted the same way that suburban white Americans do, then Trump would never have been elected president and his brand of authoritarianism would not be competitive in national elections. If all white Americans voted like those who live in cities, meanwhile, then Trump’s party would have negligible influence over the federal government. What’s more, Harper acknowledges that rural white Americans are “overrepresented” among those who support restoring Trump to power by force. Given these facts, it’s silly to argue that urban and suburban white people are doing more to imperil American democracy than their rural counterparts. Harper’s only real counter is that more supporters of January 6 live in cities than in rural areas. But this is a trivial point: Roughly 80 percent of Americans live in non-rural areas. Name any ideological group under the sun and you’re almost certain to find that a majority of that group lives in high-population municipalities, rather than in places that, by definition, have few people. 2) Millions of rural white Americans support the Democratic Party All this said, rural white voters are not a monolith. In fact, such voters were an indispensable part of Biden’s 2020 coalition. Yes, the president won only 28 percent of that voting bloc, but that adds up to more than 9 million votes. In 2020, Biden won nationally by roughly 7 million ballots and took many swing states by tiny margins. Subtract all rural white Democrats from Biden’s column and Trump almost certainly would have won reelection. Waldman and Schaller’s rhetoric does a disservice to this small but significant segment of the public, which has held the line against Trumpism in places where doing so entails significant social penalties and risks. More importantly — as Harper and Jacobs emphasize — demonizing white rural voters is a luxury that urban liberals can scarcely afford. Yes, the median white voter in rural America is never going to support Biden. But rural white swing voters exist. And in a close election, even a small reduction or increase in Biden’s share of that bloc could prove decisive. 3) Rural white Republicans are not New Deal Democrats who got confused Liberals and leftists have long debated the root causes of rural America’s support for the Republican Party. Some point to the fact that rural white Americans supported the New Deal and conclude that many in the demographic would back Democrats again today if only the party offered more ambitious economic reforms. Others argue that rural white people are simply too racist to support a minimally progressive political party. By my lights, it is unwise to base your theory of American political behavior in 2024 on voting patterns in 1932. A lot has happened in the last 92 years. When FDR was first elected, 43 percent of Americans lived in rural areas the entire South was controlled by a white supremacist faction that was briefly, improbably tethered to a coalition with northern liberals the unemployment rate was stuck above 20 percent personal income per capita in the US was roughly one-seventh as high as it is today the sexual revolution had not yet occurred conservative mass media barely existed, and there was, more or less, no federal welfare state. There is no reason in principle to assume that rural voters’ political priorities and inclinations have not changed along with their country. As Schaller and Waldman demonstrate, the argument that many rural white people are motivated by racial resentments is significantly more robust. But, as Nicholas Jacobs suggests, it is almost certainly true that not all white rural Republicans are motivated by racism. Yet Jacobs’s essay for Politico dances around the other primary explanation for rural white support for Trump: They simply have many conservative beliefs and policy preferences. After all, rural voters are more conservative than urban ones in virtually every developed country, including those where race plays a smaller role in politics than it does in America. You don’t need to be racist to believe a fetus is a person. And rural Americans are disproportionately supportive of abortion restrictions, which likely influences their partisan preferences. Many rural areas also depend on extractive, carbon-intensive industries for economic growth. Likely as a result, rural Americans are less supportive of climate action than urban or suburban ones, even when controlling for partisanship and demographics. Jacobs suggests that rural Americans’ opposition to liberal immigration policies is rooted less in racism than a desire to preserve their sense of “place.” This premise is debatable, at best. Yet Jacobs doesn’t merely wish to argue that rural Americans’ desire for community preservation has little to do with racism but also that it has little to do with conservatism: Taken as a whole, rural voters are not merely reacting against change — be it demographic or economic. They are actively seeking to preserve a sense of agency over their future and a continuity of their community’s values and social structures. Some might call this conservatism, but I think it is the same thing motivating fears of gentrification in urban areas, or the desire to “keep Portland weird.” It is true that rural Americans aren’t the only ones who try to protect their communities from outsiders and cultural change. Urban and suburban liberals do this through housing policies that make their municipalities less affordable for newcomers, while rural conservatives do it by supporting anti-immigration politicians. In both cases, the political impulse driving voter behavior is a conservative one: Prizing stasis over change and insiders over outsiders is, more or less, the antithesis of progressivism, properly understood. 4) The economic challenges facing many rural areas are inherently difficult to solve. Both sides in the White Rural Rage debate agree that Democrats have done more to help rural America materially than Republicans have. In addition to saving many rural hospitals with Medicaid expansion, Democrats have also directed a disproportionate share of federal job creation dollars toward low-density areas. But Jacobs emphasizes that these are inadequate to address rural areas’ problems. Such communities often suffer from limited employment opportunities, fiscal shortfalls, and teacher shortages — all of which are partly a function of falling populations. Yet the causes of rural America’s depopulation are structural. High-population areas inherently offer greater opportunities for workers to specialize and complement each other’s labor. This translates into higher productivity, which generally translates into higher wages. It would take an enormous amount of social engineering to stop ambitious young people born into declining rural areas from migrating to cities and suburbs. Making rural life sufficiently appealing to retain around 20 percent of the US population already requires massive subsidization of inefficient rural infrastructure and health care systems. Given that rural ways of life are also more carbon intensive than high-density living, attempting to engineer an increase in the rural population through social policy seems ill-advised. Meanwhile, many important policy initiatives — such as increasing housing abundance in thriving metro centers — would likely have the side effect of accelerating rural depopulation. One measure that plausibly could arrest the decline of many economically depressed rural communities would be place-based immigration policies, which offer visas to immigrants willing to work in low- density areas. But this is the exact opposite of what rural white voters are demanding from their representatives. There is a lot more that Democrats can do to help working-class people writ large. But the party lacks a great, politically viable answer for reviving shrinking rural communities because there isn’t one. 5) Most people inherit the politics of their families and communities Finally, however one interprets the politics of white rural America, I think it’s a mistake to treat ordinary Trump voters with contempt or as bad human beings by definition. (I don’t think Waldman and Schaller necessarily do this, but some on their side of the argument do.) In Salon , Amanda Marcotte applauds White Rural Rage for treating its subjects as “functioning adults who have agency” and not “the childlike ciphers of Fox News.” This is an understandable sentiment. Marcotte is herself a product of white rural America who rejected the reactionary politics of her parents. Her impatience with apologias for Trump supporters in “the Heartland” — which often attribute their lamentable voting behavior to everything but their own failures of good citizenship — is well-founded. At the same time, Marcotte is an exception from the general rule: Most voters inherit the politics of the families and communities they were born into. According to a 2023 Pew survey , more than 80 percent of American teens support the same political party as their parents. I believe that my politics are more moral than those of a Trump voter, but I don’t think that says much about my moral character. I was born to liberal parents in a left-leaning suburb of a blue state. If I’d grown up in a rural town where everyone I knew and loved believed that Democrats were the Godless servants of corrupt elites and shiftless poor people, then I’d probably have voted for Trump; the data admits no other conclusion. Awareness of how thoroughly accidents of birth and experience shape our selves and life outcomes should make us more supportive of income redistribution and more opposed to retributive criminal justice policies. But it should also make us a bit more patient with Trump voters. This does not mean that liberals shouldn’t harshly criticize reactionary beliefs or candidates. But we should hate the vote, not the voter. Rage is rarely the most politically productive emotion — whether it’s of the “white rural” or urban liberal variety. Will you support Vox today?

"1","O hne jene Kunst würden wir Nichts als Vordergrund sein und ganz und gar im Banne jener Optik leben, welche das Nächste und Gemeinste als ungeheuer gross und als die Wirklichkeit an sich erscheinen lässt. Without art we would be nothing but foreground and would live entirely under the spell of that perspective which makes what is closest at hand and most vulgar appear as if it were vast, and reality itself. — Friedrich Nietzsche, Die fröhliche Wissenschaft (1882) I Frühling in Wien . Springtime in Vienna. A simple phrase that conjures up a multitude of charming images: the thousands of chestnut trees lining the Hauptallee all bursting into bloom at once, the throngs of Sunday picnickers in the Wurstelprater, the elderflower spritzers served at sidewalk Schanigärten , the annual flower shows and garden fairs, the foragers in the Vienna Woods rooting around for early shoots of wild garlic. In the year 1917, however, these quintessentially Viennese pursuits lacked their usual savor. Elsewhere in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, along the Isonzo River, in the Carpathian Mountains, and in the Balkans, the lavish bloodletting of the Great War continued apace. Emperor Franz Josef I, having reigned for sixty-eight years, finally paid the toll due to nature, and was laid to an eternal rest in a stone sarcophagus beneath the Capuchin Church. And wartime poverty had begun to invade the spirits of the Viennese, with crowds chanting “We are hungry, give us something to eat! Expel the Jews who are eating everything up!” — a libelous vilification, and a warning of far worse to come. It was on a May day in that anxious year of 1917 that a young woman made her way to no. 11 Feldmühlgasse, a secluded spot in western Vienna’s Hietzing district, situated about halfway between the Baroque confection of the Schloss Schönbrunn and the wide woodlands of the Lainzer Tiergarten. There she found herself in a lush suburban sanctuary hidden within the sprawling imperial city, a pastoral idyll shielded from the horrors and upheavals of the age, where lay a single-story cottage home belonging to the reclusive symbolist painter Gustav Klimt. The Fräulein followed a gravel path through a garden full of budding Damask rose shrubs and fruit trees, passed beneath bowers of drooping foliage, and crossed the threshold into Klimt’s rustic home. (READ MORE from Matthew Omolesky: Most Americans Can’t Find Ukraine on a Map. That Doesn’t Dilute Our Duty to Defend It. ) She was received by the painter, who was sporting his trademark floor-length blue smock, and together they processed through rooms adorned with Japanese woodcuts and Wiener Werkstätte furniture, not to mention a considerable number of cats, and into a light- filled atelier. This was her ninth such visit, and the lady was by now quite familiar with the established ritual of portrait-sitting, which entailed arranging a cerulean flower-embroidered cloak over her shoulders, and assuming the same confident frontal pose she had taken during her eight previous sittings. This was to be her last time in the studio, as Klimt was evidently putting the finishing touches on the three-quarter length portrait. When her time was up, the Fräulein left the cottage, left the leafy Hietzing district, and returned to bustling, roiling central Vienna, having no idea that she had provided Klimt with the material for his very last portrait. Gustav Klimt died of a stroke nine months later, on February 6, 1918, leaving his likeness of the young Viennese lady unfinished and unsigned. Some charcoal marks and stenciling remain on the patchy red, orange, and mauve abstract background, suggesting that Klimt had more to add, perhaps intending to bring it in line with another one of his final works, Dame mit Fächer , or Lady with a Fan , which was also resting on an easel at the time of his demise, and featured a riot of blossoms and exotic birds behind the female figure. Or perhaps not, given that a similarly busy background would likely have clashed with the woman’s richly-decorated cloak. In most other respects the portrait seems to be complete — the product of the subject’s many trips to Klimt’s studio between April and May of 1917 — although the black outline around her hands is a bit thicker than one would expect, as opposed to the more delicate treatment found in works like the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II (1912) and the Portrait of Friederike-Maria Beer ( 1916). We cannot know what the final product would have looked like, had Klimt not put the portrait aside before contracting Spanish flu, coming down with bacterial pneumonia, and then suffering a fatal stroke. The greatest mystery of all, however, is the precise identity of the young woman herself. She is generally thought to have been one of the daughters of Justus and Henriette (Lilly) Lieser, either Hélène or Anna, or perhaps one of their cousins, Margarethe Constance Lieser, the daughter of the industrialist Adolf Lieser, so the work has been given the vague name of Bildnis Fräulein Lieser , or Portrait of Fräulein Lieser . Upon Klimt’s death, the painting was apparently delivered to Lilly Lieser’s residence at the Palais Lanna in Vienna’s Wieden district, and appeared in public one more time, in 1925, at a Klimt retrospective at the Neue Galerie. When the Lieser family’s art collection was “aryanized” — illegally appropriated — by the Nazi authorities after the Anschluß, the portrait was not among those seized, so it must have passed to another private collection in the meantime. The Portrait of Fräulein Lieser was thereafter considered “lost” for nearly a century, surviving only in the form of a black and white photograph taken at the time of the 1925 Neue Galerie exhibition. II In the early days of 2024, the Viennese auction house Im Kinsky announced the forthcoming sale of Gustav Klimt’s vanished masterpiece, scheduled for April 24, news which took the art world entirely by surprise. It turned out that the owners of the portrait, who remain anonymous, approached the auction house in 2022 about the possibility of putting the painting up for sale. Ernst Ploil, a managing director at Im Kinsky, was able to confirm that the Portrait of Fräulein Lieser had changed ownership three times since 1960 by way of bequest, and although the provenance of the portrait between 1925 and 1960 remains elusive, it has further been determined that it was not unlawfully seized during the Nazi era, and there are no outstanding Nazi-looted art claims pertaining to it. A settlement was nevertheless reached with the legal successors of the Lieser family, enabling them to receive a share of the proceeds of the auction — expected to amount to somewhere between €30 and €50 million. The anonymous owners of the Klimt portrait have timed their sale well, given the astronomical auction prices for works by the Vienna Secessionist master in recent years. Klimt paintings have always commanded a pretty penny — his 1905 portrait of Karl Wittgenstein’s daughter Margaret was commissioned for 10,000 crowns, an order of magnitude higher than the average middle-class yearly salary at the time — but their value in the twenty-first century has become almost ludicrous. Klimt’s Birch Forest went for a hammer price of $104.6 million in 2022, while his landscape Insel Im Attersee and his Lady with a Fan both went on the block the following year, netting $53 million and $108.4 million respectively. Back in 1994, by way of comparison, Lady with a Fan was sold by Sotheby’s for $11.6 million (roughly $24 million when adjusted for inflation), while the 2023 auction, again by Sotheby’s, represented the highest price ever paid for a work of art in a European public sale. The unfinished Portrait of Fräulein Lieser is unlikely to go quite so high, but will assuredly garner a substantial sum. In order to stoke interest in the sale, Im Kinsky has sent Fräulein Lieser’s likeness off on a global tour, with stops in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, and Hong Kong. Thus Klimt’s “lost” masterpiece has returned to the public eye after almost a century in obscurity. It is worth noting that, despite the word being routinely used in unthinking newspaper copy, the Portrait of Fräulein Lieser was never “lost.” Since at least 1960, the painting has been in the possession of the anonymous family which now stands, along with the Lieser heirs, to make a veritable fortune when it goes on the market. There is a regrettable tendency to consider a painting lost or somehow misplaced if it is not on display in a public or private museum, or routinely featured in exhibitions, retrospectives, or catalogues raisonnés . Yet portraits are primarily for domestic consumption, and there is always something a bit jarring about seeing, say, those endearing little portraits of cherubic Georgian children by Gainsborough, Reynolds, Romney, Raeburn, Hoppner, Zoffany, or Lawrence hanging limply on a museum wall, rather than in the manor house or townhome in which they belong, just as there is something sordid about sculptures or frescos being torn out of a church or temple and placed in a sterile museum gallery, to be glanced briefly and immediately forgotten, instead of being treated with the veneration they once received and still deserve. (READ MORE: ‘Virus of Freedom’ Spreading in Russia: Alexei Navalny and the Vladimir Highway ) The German-Bohemian writer Johannes Urzidil, in his captivating 1966 tale “The Duchess of Albanera,” tells the story of a Praguian bank clerk by the name of Wenzel Schaschek who steals a mannerist portrait of the Duchess Eleonor of Albanera from the State Gallery. Having hidden the purloined picture in his apartment, Schaschek addresses his guest: Your Highness doesn’t look too happy today. I admit that for a lady of your station staying in an armoire is a little unorthodox. But for Your Majesty, as well as for me, a whole new era has dawned. Bear in mind that you now have a private life again. Is it really so desirable to be in a gallery under the surveillance of plebeian guards, always stuck in the same spot, at the mercy of the curious and shameless gazes of every petit bourgeois who comes along, every adolescent brat, every snobbish schmuck? Isn’t that a thousand times worse than being in a prison, rightfully or wrongfully, or in a convent, where at least you can live a spiritual life even though it may be against your will? Toasting his new flatmate, Schaschek concludes: With me you’ll live, dear Duchess, because I live with you. In the big museum, which admittedly has something palatial about it, you were merely preserved, kept chemically healthy, a thermometer, barometer, and hygrometer showing the experts that you were doing well. Were you doing well? But here, albeit in a modest environment, you can lead a normal life, may fulfill your duties, might share my joys and cares and are not only given admiration as nourishment but — as it is between human beings — the occasional piquancy of a loving objection or (now, for example) blissful praise. Urzidil was not, of course, endorsing art theft, but rather emphasizing the sheer intimacy of portraiture, so out of place in impersonal museums, which are, as the Colombian philosopher Nicolás Gómez Dávila maintained, “ el invento de una humanidad que no tiene puesto para las obras de arte, ni en su casa, ni en su vida [the invention of a mankind that has no place for works of art, either in its home, or in its life].” The Portrait of Fräulein Lieser belongs in a Viennese apartment, above the hearth in a bright and airy parlor, or on the wall of a well-traveled hallway, or arresting the passerby’s attention from atop a marble staircase, and not “at the mercy of the curious” in a public gallery. Yet in all likelihood, when the gavel strikes, the portrait will go not to a museum but to the likes of Patti Wong, of Patti Wong & Associates, who purchased the Lady with a Fan last year on behalf of an unknown Hong Kong collector. After all, cash-strapped museums can no longer compete with mega-collectors at these Klimt auctions; Insel Im Attersee and Birch Forest likewise went to anonymous private buyers. The Portrait of Fräulein Lieser thus has come to represent not a memento of a beloved family member, or a part of our collective cultural patrimony, but a prize for a private collector, destined to become part of an investment portfolio, with the potential to achieve massive returns by dint of its inherently non-fungible nature. The best case scenario, given the rise of mysterious but fabulously-wealthy mega-collectors and the concomitant decline of public museums, is what the Brussels-based art collector Alain Servais has termed the “ schaulager ,” which “is a kind of storage site but one equipped with a team that makes sure your collection is known by all the museums and curators in the world. You make sure that the works are lent and shown regularly. That for me is the future.” It is not a particularly democratic future, certainly, but at least those works would be made available for occasional exhibitions and serious researchers, and protected from the vandalistic depredations of Just Stop Oil activists, and from progressive museum curators who insist on informing visitors that, for example, Constable landscape paintings evoke “dark nationalist feelings” — what the art critic Waldemar Januszczak calls the “collapse here of useful scholarship and its replacement by wokeish drivel.” III Klimt’s final, unfinished portrait disappeared from public view in 1925. Unlike most masterpieces, it then lived what Urzidil called a “normal life,” sharing the joy and pain of several generations of an anonymous Viennese family, until its value reached such a level that a public sale became inevitable. Now it is criss-crossing the globe, and art collectors and investors will soon be trying to outbid each other and lay their hands on the last Klimt. It is tempting to wonder whether the Portrait of Fräulein Lieser is “worth” €50 million, but this is an uninteresting question, since the value of an item is mutually determined by market participants, and that is more or less that. It is rather more useful to consider the portrait on its own merits. In his later years, Klimt left behind the intricate geometric patterns and grandiose pyrotechnics of his golden phase behind, as his portraits increasingly featured delicate floral motifs drawn from Chinese and Japanese art. There is an impressionistic naturalism to his depiction of Fräulein Lieser, be she Hélène, Anna, or Margarethe, that is quite distinct from, for example, the (admittedly iconic) stylized representation of Adele Bloch-Bauer that resides in New York’s Neue Galerie. Here Fräulein Lieser calmly returns the viewer’s gaze, a slightly quizzical expression on her face, her head cocked ever so slightly to the left, her milk-and-blood complexion standing out against the coral background. The Italian art historian Federico Zeri observed: L’universo klimtiano si concentra sulla donna come idolo malsano e ossessivo e raccoglie la sfida al moralismo già lanciato da Schnitzler e Hofmannsthal, dalla misoginia di Weininger o dal motore erotico di Freud. Ecco allora corpi scomposti o riassorbiti in un decorativismo fortemente allusivo, ma nell’eterno divenire dell’essere umano anche l’ambiguo potere erotico della femme fatale cede allo spettro della morte. The Klimtian universe focuses on women as an unhealthy and obsessive idol, and takes up the challenge to moralism already launched by Schnitzler and Hofmannsthal, by Weininger’s misogyny, or by Freud’s erotic engine. Here then are bodies decomposed or reabsorbed in a highly allusive decorativism, but in the eternal burgeoning of the human being, even the ambiguous erotic power of the femme fatale yields to the specter of death. Another art historian, T.J. Clark, has argued that Klimt “has a place of honour” in the ranks of early twentieth century so-called “ Kitschmeisters ,” owing to his “pretend mystery and profundity, pretend eroticism and excess.” Yet none of that decadence, none of that ostentation, none of that excess of ornamentation, none of that unhealthy eroticism, is remotely present here. What we have is an exquisite portrait of the daughter of one of his patrons, and nothing more, yet like all great portraits it expertly conveys the sitter’s unique personality, and can instantaneously whisk us back to a particular place and time, in this case springtime in Vienna in the year 1917, just as Europe was in the process of attempting civilizational suicide, and the sophisticated artistic climate of the fin de siècle was undergoing radical, irreversible changes. Klimt continues to capture the modern imagination, just as he did when he was the most sought-after portraitist and decorative painter of his day. In an era when Instagram is awash with duck- face portraits taken with selfie-sticks, and the best-selling interior paint color is Agreeable Gray (SW 7029), Klimt’s psychological insight and fondness for decorative motifs still stands out. The art movement he led, the Vienna Secession, famously declared: Der Zeit ihre Kunst. Der Kunst ihre Freiheit. To every age its art. To every art its freedom. Today we live in an eternal present, a stuck culture, small-minded and beholden to post-modern pieties and “wokeish drivel.” The Vienna Secessionists were far more broad-minded. As the contemporary symbolist painter Roberto Rosenman put it, “from the onset, the Vienna Secession brought together Naturalists, Modernists, Impressionists and cross-pollinated among all disciplines forming a total work of art; a Gesamkunstwerk . In this respect, the Secession drew inspiration from William Morris and the English Arts and Crafts movement which sought to re-unite fine and applied arts.” The soaring sprit of Klimt and his fellow Secessionists is one sadly lacking in our age of deconstruction, dismantling, and plastic disposability. (READ MORE: The Stable Path: Two Years of Ukraine’s Fight for Survival ) Viewed one way, the last Klimt is simply a charming portrait, a captivating image of a young Viennese woman, the daughter of a prominent Jewish industrialist, in the first flower of her radiant youth. Viewed another way, the Portrait of Fräulein Lieser is a haunting artifact of a lost civilization, one most likely commissioned by Lilly Lieser, who managed to send her daughters to safety in England and the United States, but was herself deported from Vienna to Riga on January 11, 1942, and died there on December 3, 1943, although some accounts suggest she may have been murdered at Auschwitz. And viewed still another way, the likeness of Fräulein Lieser represents the last gasp of the Vienna Secession and Jugendstil , the dying breath of a world smothered by war, disease, and the relentless march of hyper-modernity. And, when it goes on the auction block, it will also symbolize the outrageous monetary (but not spiritual or aesthetic) valuation of classic works of art by our own society, which is constitutionally incapable of creating anything meaningful of its own, and where there is, to borrow Friedrich Nietzsche’s phrase, “ Nichts als Vordergrund ” — “nothing but foreground.” Ödön von Horváth, an Austro-Hungarian playwright who trenchantly, and at times hilariously, chronicled the gradual dehumanization of his beloved civilization, once wrote: Lieber als Arzt wollt ich Lehrer werden. Lieber als kranke heilen, wollte ich gesunden etwas mitgeben, einen winzigen Stein für den Bau einer schönen Zukunft. I would rather be a teacher than a doctor. Rather than healing the sick, I want to give something to the healthy, a tiny stone for building a beautiful future. Gustav Klimt was not a perfect painter, and T.J. Clark has reason to detect a certain artificiality in his oeuvre, an over-reliance on surreal, ersatz eroticism and extravagant decorativism, a charge to which the painter himself would have readily pleaded guilt. But at his best — including the Portrait of Fräulein Lieser , alongside Lady with a Fan and other of his very last works — Klimt managed to provide posterity with those tiny stones from which we can recreate a beautiful past, and even build a beautiful future, if only we could see beyond the oppressively vulgar perspective imposed by our alleged civilization."
"1","Ever since June of 2022, when Arizona became the first state to legalize universal school choice, the adoption of this K–12th grade education reform has accelerated well beyond even its boosters’ wildest dreams. Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah, and West Virginia have all enacted policies which fund families to educate their kids, not just at the local public school, but at a private school, a homeschool, an online academy, or a parent-run microschool. And eight states with partial school choice programs — Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wyoming — are viewed as likely to expand them by the end of this year. As school choice legislation proliferates, attention has naturally focused on associated K–12th grade issues. How, for example, can the growing number of families who want to homeschool their children, either by themselves or in neighborhood collaboratives, evaluate the effectiveness of various online curricula? How does one measure the academic quality of a church-run school? And to what extent should homeschooled children and those in small private schools have access to public school athletic and science facilities? (READ MORE from Lewis M. Andrews: Microschool Incentives Could Stem Commercial Real Estate Crisis ) Yet many education experts believe that the changes which are currently taking place at the primary and secondary level have profound implications for higher education as well. Especially when it comes to loosening the grip of progressive thinking and its disturbing policy implications — restricted speech, anti-Semitism, race-based hiring, and segregated dormitories — on so many American colleges and universities. For example, Foundation for Economic Freedom senior education fellow Kerry McDonald believes that the more today’s K-12 th grade students are educated at schools which best match their learning styles, the more self-reliant they will be after graduation — and, as a result, less susceptible to campus indoctrination. Those who go on for a bachelor’s degree, she says, will be “far more willing to challenge the professors with whom they disagree” while others, having compared the cost of what they can expect from higher education to how else they could invest the money, “might not have much interest in going to college at all.” University of Arkansas education researcher Albert Cheng agrees with McDonald that school choice is preparing future undergraduates to more effectively resist campus progressivism. He notes that families’ growing freedom to design their children’s educations has increased the demand for K-12 th grade schools which use a so-called “classical curriculum” — one that combines a mastery of basic skills and the reading of great books with an emphasis on moral and spiritual values. Cheng says the number of private and parochial schools which have adopted this curriculum has spiked nearly 400 percent just since Covid. Once more, this tendency to use choice to school one’s child in a more traditional setting even extends to what Sacred Heart University professor Christel Manning calls “marginally religious” and “religiously unaffiliated” parents. They themselves may have fallen away from their birth family’s church or simply never had any religious interest to begin with but nevertheless want to counter the moral relativism which has crept into so much of modern culture. Of course, some colleges and universities have large enough endowments to keep promoting whatever ideology they want, regardless of how many fewer students apply to them or how effectively those who do enroll can contest what they are being taught. But the number of such institutions is much smaller than generally supposed. For example, New York University, which ranks 20 in College Raptor’s ranking of investable assets, has a portfolio worth only 10 percent of top ranked Harvard’s $41.8 billion. Over time, most post-secondary institutions which continue to cling to a progressive outlook are almost certain to lose applicants to the small but growing number of colleges and universities which emphasize character development and independent thought. Most famously Hillsdale College, but also schools like Baylor University, Benedictine College (Kansas), Claremont College, the University of Dallas, Wheaton College, Wyoming Catholic, and the various “great books” colleges. On the other hand, those left-wing institutions which do bring themselves to intellectually accommodate the coming generation of “school choice” graduates are likely to be further swayed by some pleasant surprises. For example, Western Carolina University Professor Angela Dills has shown that high school students in states where families are subsidized to choose their children’s K-12 placements are significantly less prone to suicide and other emotional problems after graduation. Her work suggests that admitting large numbers of students who have benefitted from school choice is an effective way for America’s colleges and universities to treat the growing epidemic of mental illness on their campuses. Another study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology sees school choice as an antidote to the stubbornly lopsided female-to-male enrollment balance (60 percent to 40 percent) which has developed in higher education. This has happened, experts believe, because most public schools require students to sit quietly for long periods, a practice which academically favors young girls, whose ability to concentrate develops much sooner than boys’. But when families are subsidized to pick the K-12 th grade placement which best suits the learning style of their child, young males not only learn better and faster but are more qualified for financial assistance when they apply to college. Finally, school choice will enable colleges and universities to realize their desire for a more diverse student body without having to covertly employ affirmative action policies. According to a 2021 study by Cheng and Paul Peterson at Harvard , minority students from lower-income households who have publicly funded access to alternative K–12th grade placements are 30 percent more likely to go onto college and, once admitted, 70 percent more likely to get a degree. (READ MORE: Meet the Suburban Parents ) Kennesaw State University professor Eric Wearne is just one of a growing number of education experts who believe school choice will improve far more than primary and secondary education. “It is,” he says, “the first phase of a much broader realignment,” one which even the most progressive college and university campuses “will not be able to resist.” Lewis M. Andrews is president of the Children’s Educational Opportunity Foundation. His latest book is Living Spiritually in the Material World (Fidelis Books)."
"1","A s millions of fans looked on, college basketball stars Caitlin Clark of Iowa and Zach Edey of Purdue both lost their championship games. Clark was able to cash in on her NIL revenue — name, image and likeness — but that was not true of Zach Edey, a seven-foot-four scoring and rebounding machine. This disparity calls attention to several back stories. In 2021, according to Businessinsider.com , “ student athletes gained the right to make money from their names, images and likenesses.” In reality, the athlete-students were born with that right and previous to 2021, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) took it away. People paid big money to see college athletes, but college and NCAA bosses reaped the profits from television rights and so forth. For the athletes, their tuition was payment in kind , and exploitation on a massive scale. Reform was long overdue. (READ MORE from Lloyd Billingsley: To Have and Withhold: The IRS Gets Your Money Before You Do ) According to athleticdirectoru.com , the first college athlete to profit from NIL was Chloe Mitchell, a volleyball player at Aquinas College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her father was an avid golfer, so Mitchell set up a mini- golf course in the living room, “filmed it, put it up, and got paid.” Mitchell was able to pay off student loans, buy a car, and start saving to buy a house. If Mitchell, not exactly a household name, can cash in, imagine the prospects for athlete-students such as Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Sheryl Swoopes, Chamique Holdsclaw, and other collegiate basketball and football stars down through the decades. Reparations could well be in order, but nobody is making that case. The NCAA warned that NIL would ruin college athletics, but nothing of the kind took place. Much of the money simply shifted to those who earned it by their performance. Caitlin Clark, who drains three-pointers with the ease of Stephen Curry, has cashed in, big time. The Iowa star has earned an estimated $3.1 million . For Purdue’s Zach Edey, a ballpark figure would be zero, but it’s not a matter of his performance on the court. “Big Maple,” as the towering center is known, hails from Toronto, Canada, and under a student visa such earnings are off limits. “ I obviously lost out on a lot of money this year,” Edey told reporters. “At the end of the day, it needs to change for sure. I understand the legal process. It takes a while.” While Edey has been piling up points, some eight million people have been allowed into the United States of America with no visas, no vaccination records, no background checks, and no job prospects. According to Judicial Watch, these entrants are the recipients of massive federal aid . That is profoundly unfair to taxpayers, legal immigrants, legitimate citizens, and talented visa holders such as Zack Edey. He and Caitlin Clark, both highly recruited, also illustrate another longstanding disparity. College Students Have a Choice, Parents Don’t Edey chose to attend Purdue and Caitlin Clark picked Iowa, but freedom of choice is not limited to athlete-students. Beneficiaries of the G.I. Bill and other scholarships are free to choose UCLA, Brigham Young, Notre Dame, and countless other campuses. Unfortunately, that is not the case with government K-12 education. Taxpayer dollars go directly to the education bureaucracy and parents must send children to the government schools in their designated area, many of them dysfunctional and dangerous. If they opt out, the money still feeds the government system, forcing parents to pay twice. This is profoundly unfair to parents and students alike. (READ MORE: Still Looking at You, Kids: Congress Aims to Extend Warrantless Surveillance for the Foreseeable Future ) Parents and students always had the right to choose but the government K-12 system takes it away, just as the NCAA took away athlete- students’ right to market their own name, image, and likeness. The time is long past to restore the right of school choice, with the dollars following the scholars. Free choice, as a matter of basic civil rights, will make winners of parents, students, and taxpayers all across the land.

"1","April 7 was the sixth month anniversary of the October 7 Hamas pogrom and the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas. For those who have been watching this war closely it was particularly disconcerting. It was on that day that the Netanyahu government announced that it was pulling most of its troops out of southern Gaza, a move that left a number of questions unanswered. Was this a harbinger of Bibi’s coalition succumbing to pressure from the Biden administration to end the war giving Hamas a victory? Was it a response to the recent violent demonstrations by the Israeli left in the guise of a demand to bring the hostages home but, like the prewar demonstrations against judicial reform, was actually meant to bring down the government? In any case the troop drawdown was a shock to commentators such as myself who have been advocating for the commencement of the operation in Rafah to finish off the remaining four Hamas battalions. But on April 7 a number of demonstrations were held in the Jewish diaspora organized for the sole purpose of emphasizing the plight of the 130 hostages still being held by Hamas. The particular rally I attended in Toronto was called “Six Months in Hell.” (READ MORE from Max Dublin: Biden Pulls a Bait and Switch on Israel ) One of the speakers was Goldie Ghamari, an Iranian human rights lawyer who is a Conservative Party member of the Ontario Legislature. She noted that Iran is the only country in the Middle East that has not held any pro-Hamas rallies, which is remarkable since Hamas is a proxy of the Iranian regime. She stated emphatically that the huge Iranian diaspora community stands squarely behind Israel, that Persians and Jews have a three-thousand-year history going all the way back to Cyrus the Great. And it is true that before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran and Israel enjoyed excellent, mutually beneficial relations. A number of speakers excoriated Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party for giving aid and comfort to Hamas. This impetus for this criticism is the unprecedented reversal of Canadian Foreign Policy which has seen the Trudeau regime give support for Hamas in the United Nations General Assembly, for which Hamas leaders have publicly thanked him. Trudeau has also restored funding to UNRWA and stopped selling military equipment to Israel, a bit of laughable virtue-signaling considering Canada sells only non-essential accessories, not military hardware, to Israel (though most of the Canadian electorate is probably unaware of this.) Like the Biden administration’s election-year pandering to Muslims in Michigan, Trudeau’s government has long pandered to the Canadian Muslim population, which is much larger than the country’s Jewish population. Whenever Trudeau was mentioned, the Toronto audience booed loudly. As I have previously written in these pages, Canada does have its share of Jewish leftist radicals who support Hamas, but all and all the Canadian Jewish population is more conservative than its American counterpart. This is due in part to the fact that a good number of Holocaust survivors immigrated to Canada and landed in Toronto after World War II. I recall that after the Six Day War broke out my father took me to a synagogue where an emergency fundraiser was taking place to support Israel during that war. It was a synagogue attended mainly by Holocaust survivors many of whom had by then become successful businessmen and within minutes of the call for contributions, the sum of the donations had grown enormously. In the end, Toronto Jews on a per capita basis contributed more to that war effort than did any other Jewish diaspora community in the world. The main speaker at the Toronto rally was Pierre Poilievre, leader of the federal Canadian Conservative Party which is the only Canadian political party that has strongly and unequivocally supported Israel in its just war against Hamas. In contrast to Trudeau, Poilievre was given a resounding welcome by the huge crowd gathered in the square. He was wearing the symbolic dog tags which have become the widespread Jewish emblem for the release of the hostages. The Canadian Conservative Party has for some time been far ahead of the Liberal Party due to destructive Liberal Party policies, and this war has seen large numbers of Jewish voters who have traditionally voted Liberal switch their affiliation to the Conservatives. We won’t know how this will play out until the general election about a year from now, but it appears likely that it will have a significant impact since Jews have also been important donors to the Liberal Party. As expected, there was a pro-Hamas counter-demonstration behind barricades on the other side of the plaza. They had a sound system and were blaring Arabic music and chanting pro-Hamas chants but were initially ignored. Eventually some participants from the demonstration to free the hostages, including myself, moved toward them and formed a counter-counter-protest to confront them. The pro-Hamas counter-protesters were a rather scraggly group compared to others that I have seen on occasions when they are not so massively outnumbered by Israel supporters. By the time I got there they had stopped chanting, ostensibly because given their small numbers that part of their demonstration was rather pathetic compared to the booming cries that were coming from the rally to free the hostages. Most of their group were young men in keffiyehs who, perhaps conscious of the puniness of their group had sheepish looks on their faces. One of them who appeared rather older than the average carried a little bundle that looked like something wrapped in a shroud with a sign proclaiming that this was one of the 1,200 Palestinian babies that had been murdered by the IDF in Gaza. There was also a woman who carried a Ukrainian flag and sign proclaiming that she was Ukrainian and pro- Hamas. Go figure. (READ MORE: Israel: Unifying Around the Center ) Our group was composed mainly of young people. All of the pro-Israel rallies that I have attended since the beginning of the war have had large contingents of young people who look to be in their late teens or in their twenties and thirties. There were no hot-heads among us and there was no rushing of the barricades behind which the Pro-Hamas demonstrators were standing. In fact, there were marshals from our group who positioned themselves between us and the counter- demonstrators to discourage this. There was a small police presence but they stood passively to the side. At one point some members of my group of counter- counter-demonstrators formed a line and then a partial circle and started dancing the hora, the most traditional of all Israeli circle dances. At first, I was taken aback by this wondering if it was appropriate to be dancing during such a solemn anniversary. But then I found myself joining the circle of dancers because somehow or other, in all the circumstances, it seemed the right thing to do. The dancing reminded me of the Yiddish song sung by the Jewish partisans during World War II . It begins Zog nit kein mol az du geyst dem letstn veg (Don’t ever say that you’re on the final road) and ends with, Mir zaynen do (We are still here!). That, I think, is why we danced the hora."
"1","WASHINGTON — Nineteen Republicans joined House Democrats on Wednesday to defeat a measure to extend Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the law that enables the federal government to spy on foreigners abroad. The procedural rule was blocked by a vote of 193-228. The world is changing. It’s a sad moment for the country when you consider how, after the 9/11 attacks, Americans stood behind efforts to allow the intelligence community access to said communications in the belief that spy craft would be used to protect Americans from hostile national security rivals. And now all of that is melting. (READ MORE from Debra J. Saunders: Biden’s Loan Amnesty Passes the Buck ) For years after 9/11, conservatives at least could be counted on to champion the intelligence establishment, while Democrats were more likely to question their methods. Then came the 2016 election and Donald Trump’s victory. But then, in January 2017, before Trump took the oath of office, BuzzFeed News ran what was peddled as a “dossier” of dirt that Russia was supposed to have put together on Trump. Problem: It wasn’t true. It turned out Democrats paid for the dossier. Later, America learned that the FBI had spied on Carter Page, who was an unpaid adviser to the Trump campaign. Awkward. The FBI is not supposed to get involved in politics. You would think that after its sordid misdeeds came to light, the FBI would have cleaned up its act. But then last year The Washington Post reported that in 2020 and 2021, the FBI wrongly tapped the government’s monster database more than 278,000 times. As the Post has detailed, federal law enforcement searches targeted Jan. 6 suspects, activists arrested after the killing of George Floyd and 19,000 donors to a congressional candidate who was challenging an incumbent. Even Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill., learned that he was a target. (Some of these revelations make you wonder how much free time agents have on their hands. Don’t they have something better to do?) My instincts lean toward renewing the authority. The White House has warned that requiring a warrant for these data searches can take weeks. That would put me in the same neighborhood as President Joe Biden, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and House Speaker Mike Johnson. But once Trump chimed in against the 702 extension, the partial GOP cave-in was sealed. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., was one of the 19 Republicans who took the opposite stance. “Speaker Mike Johnson is urging members to reauthorize FISA after President Trump said: KILL FISA. It’s like asking the Deep State to hold itself accountable after it has abused the American people’s trust,” she posted on social media. Actually, Johnson was standing up for what he thought was right. I don’t trust MTG, but I do understand conservatives’ distrust of what Trump calls the “deep state.” Too many times those who are supposed to serve the public act as if they own the government. In this case, the FBI was caught red-handed but did not reform. (READ MORE: Border Is Big Issue for 2024 ) That’s the kind of arrogance that leads voters to lean toward politicians who don’t want to govern, but just want to get on cable news.

"1","N early 60 years ago, the renowned prose stylist and infamous Catholic convert Evelyn Waugh passed away. On Easter Sunday (April 10) 1966, after attending a soon-to-be-banned Tridentine Mass, Waugh met his ignominious fate in the lavatory, reportedly having suffered a coronary thrombosis. He left behind a devoted wife, seven children, 14 novels, about two dozen short stories, seven volumes of travel writing (including one detailing his time as a war correspondent in Africa), three biographies (of artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti, martyred Saint Edmund Campion, and English priest ad author Ronald Knox), countless letters, and a legacy of wit, wisdom, and (sometimes begrudging) faithfulness to the Catholic Church. Although he was born nearly 121 years ago and died nearly 60 years ago, Waugh’s life is one filled with lessons for Catholics today. Indeed, one of the many reasons his works are considered enduring classics is not just the author’s biting wit, cast of colorful characters, and soaring, often elegiac writing style — though, of course, those are all reasons in themselves — but the wisdom he evinced in facing many of the same challenges, questions, and even crises that Catholics face today. (READ MORE from S.A. McCarthy: DC Cardinal Surprisingly Praises Pope Francis on LGBT Issues ) Raised in the Church of England, the bright and bullying Waugh was an ardent agnostic by the age of fifteen. He quickly added hedonism to his spiritual resumé, alongside agnosticism, and his time at Oxford University was spent drinking heavily, dabbling in homosexuality, and leading a lifestyle that would have been considered outlandish even by the more whimsical standards of 1920s English university life. As one can imagine, hosting debauched costume parties that culminated in orgies in chartered hearses was not conducive to study, and Waugh was eventually forced to leave the University after achieving one poor grade too many. The budding author took up a position as a schoolmaster at a dilapidated boarding school in Wales and, missing his friends and his hard-partying Oxford social life, attempted suicide. He left his clothes neatly folded on the beach and walked into the ocean, preparing to drown himself. Fortunately, God almighty had had the foresight to create jellyfish, a swarm of which turned Waugh back to the beach. The comic novel Decline and Fall was based on Waugh’s experiences as a schoolteacher and won him both fame and fortune. He courted and was briefly married to Evelyn Gardner (they’re friends called the duo “He-velyn and She- velyn”), but that marriage ended acrimoniously when she proved unfaithful to her husband and unwilling to attempt to salvage the marriage. Faced with this devastating blow, Waugh chose not suicide, having failed in that endeavor once already, but a new home: the Catholic Church. Waugh’s conversion to Catholicism in 1930 was controversial. His father, a devout Anglican, referred to it as his son’s “perversion to Rome.” As most in his generation were embracing nihilism and atheism spiritually and turning to socialism and progressivism politically, the up-and-coming literary star Waugh bucked the trend, looking not to the nebulous “future,” but to eternity. Having experienced himself the disastrous results of the madness of the modern age, Waugh wrote of his conversion, “The trouble about the world today is that there’s not enough religion in it. There’s nothing to stop young people doing whatever they feel like doing at the moment.” For Waugh, Catholicism represented order, in stark contrast to the political, philosophical, and social chaos of his age. He saw the Catholic Church not as some ideology that happened to align with his own sentiments, but as an institution of spiritual and moral order to which he would have to subject himself. Jesuit Fr. Martin D’Arcy, who oversaw Waugh’s conversion and became his spiritual mentor, wrote, “I have never myself met a convert who so strongly based his assents on truth.” This is the first lesson we can learn from Waugh: endurance in faith. Like St. Thomas Aquinas some 700 years prior, Waugh believed the Catholic Church to be the ultimate force of logic and reason operative in the world. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Waugh admitted that the Church was, in fact, more reasonable than he, and thus submitted to her doctrines. When asked in an interview, 30 years after his conversion, if he had any doubts about God or the truth of Catholicism, a by-then aged and bloated Waugh bluntly responded, “No.” Waugh’s faith was evident in his unquestioning submission to the Catholic Church. After the dissolution of his first marriage with Gardner, Waugh waited patiently for an annulment. The process reportedly took years longer than was the norm, and Waugh did much in that time to publicly demonstrate his devotion the Catholic Church, including writing his biography of Edmund Campion, for which he was awarded the prestigious Hawthornden Prize. When his annulment was finally granted, Waugh was asked why he didn’t badger and pester the Vatican courts — his paperwork had apparently been misplaced, accounting for the delay. The convert simply replied that he didn’t know how long an annulment should take and was willing to wait however long the Church required. (READ MORE: Dawkins and the Frankenstein’s Monster of Atheism ) This episode is reminiscent of St. Patrick’s baptism of the King of Cashel. According to legend, Patrick accidentally pierced the king’s foot with his bishop’s crozier. The Saint was unaware of having done so and the king bit his tongue. When Patrick realized that he had stabbed the king’s foot, he asked why the Irishman did not cry out in pain. The king simply replied that he thought it was part of the baptism ritual and was thus willing to suffer it. Waugh’s chief difficulty with Catholicism was in conforming his will to the moral precepts of the Church — somewhat ironically, given that the stringent moral code of the Church is one of the chief attractions that sparked his conversion in the first place. For much of his life, Waugh was something of a bully. He delighted in baffling, teasing, and even tormenting others. Much of the time, this took the form of practical jokes that he alone found amusing. One biographer tells of the time that Waugh hosted a (white) guest named Moor. The author made repeated references to jazz and “negro culture,” which his wife later explained was simply a pun on the guest’s surname. However, Waugh had a cruel streak, and he struggled to reconcile this with the charity demanded by the Church. In one infamous instance, Waugh’s bullying caused a young woman to leave a party in tears. His friend Nancy Mitford asked him how he could possibly be so callous and still call himself a Catholic. The bully par excellence responded with both wit and a strange sort of humility, “You have no idea how much nastier I would be if I was not a Catholic. Without supernatural aid I would hardly be a human being.” It takes a great deal of faith to admit that you are, in fact, a wretch in need of aid. But Waugh did exercise charity. While serving as a commando in World War II, alongside Randolph Churchill, Waugh rescued many persecuted Jews in war-torn Yugoslavia, offering financial assistance and making sure that many were able to escape the brutalities of both the Nazis and the communist revolutionaries led by Marshal Tito. Waugh also managed to write up reports for the British Foreign Office and Pope Pius XII on the persecution of Yugoslav Catholics under the communists. “The Church,” Waugh once wrote, “is the normal state of man from which men have disastrously exiled themselves.” Over the course of his life, Waugh sought to return to that “normal state of man” and end both his earthly and spiritual “exile,” amid an age of rapidly shifting political standards and rapidly decaying moral codes. The second lesson we may learn from Waugh is to never abandon the Church in her time of need. When Waugh converted in 1930, the Tridentine Mass was then the norm in the Church. He fell in love with the order, the majesty, and the symbolism of the Mass, finding there the link between the temporal order and the Kingdom of Heaven. In the 1960s, under Pope St. Paul VI and the “reforms” of the Second Vatican Council, the Tridentine Mass was reconsidered and revised, and Waugh began to fear that the solemn and sacred grandeur of the Mass which brough him to Rome might be diluted, damaged, or altogether discarded. He wrote, on behalf of the laity: We hold the creeds, we attempt to observe the moral law, we go to Mass on days of obligation and glance rather often at the vernacular translations of the Latin…. We go to some inconvenience to educate our children in the Faith…. In every age we have formed the main body of “the faithful,” and we believe that it was for us, as much as for the saints and for the notorious sinners, that the Church was founded. In a series of letters, Waugh expressed his concerns to his bishop, Cardinal John Carmel Heenan of Westminster. He was worried that the role of the priest would be diminished in an effort to make the laity feel more empowered and that, in an attempt to encourage the laity to participate more vocally in the Mass, their spiritual participation might be forgotten. He considered the introduction of the vernacular into the Mass to be an unnecessary diminution of the mystical nature of Christ’s sacrifice: This was the Mass for whose restoration the Elizabethan martyrs had gone to the scaffold. Saint Augustine, St. Thomas à Becket, St. Thomas More, Challoner and Newman would have been perfectly at their ease among us; were, in fact, present there with us…. Their presence would not have been more palpable had we been making the responses aloud in the modern fashion. He wrote that the slow disappearance of the Tridentine Mass “leaves me without comfort or edification. I shall never, pray God, apostatize but churchgoing is now a bitter trial.” Had Waugh been told that some forty years later, the late Pope Benedict XVI would once again promulgate the Mass of the ages with his motu proprio Summorum pontificum, the convert would have no doubt taken comfort. But since Pope Francis’s motu proprio Traditionis custodes has restricted celebration of the Tridentine Mass , perhaps we may take some comfort from Waugh’s example of humble grumbling and longsuffering. The final lesson we might learn from Waugh is to focus our attentions and our energies on that which really matters. Despite his commercial and critical successes and his relatively opulent lifestyle, Waugh’s chief focus was on eternity. He recognized the truth which Christ spoke in the Gospel: “[S]tore up treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor decay destroys, nor thieves break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be” (Matthew 6:20-21). He thus built his treasure not on bookshelves nor in his (rather expansive) wardrobe, but in his family, the souls entrusted to his care.

Waugh responded that he believed God had given him a particular talent or penchant for writing, but that writing was not his purpose. Instead, he explained, his literary talents were given to him as a means of supporting his true purpose: “My service is simply to bring up one family.” Waugh’s family life wasn’t always easy — he and his wife lost one of their seven children in infancy, and Waugh often struggled to express affection for his children. But he worked hard, often writing thousands of words per day, to provide for his wife and children. He went to great expense to ensure his children were not just educated well but educated Catholic. And his children learned that their father didn’t necessarily fail to show them constant affection but rather fought hard to be charitable to mankind in general, and succeeded best with his wife and children. Today, Waugh is best remembered as a talented author, a grouchy reactionary, a vicious wit, and a devout Catholic. Perhaps that is not a bad legacy to leave behind."
"1","Culture counts. It is not everything, but it is often the most important influence, whether in an organization or a corporation or a nation. I spent some time in Japan on business, and I loved the culture of precision, efficiency, care, and self-sacrifice, replete with an insistence on finding the natural beauty wherever it is. I knew I didn’t dare come to the station a minute late for my train—I’d see it departing as I would be running up the stairs. Not like my Amtrak experiences, where the only question was how late the train would be. I could rely on people paying attention, whether it was the desk clerk that left her post at the hotel to help me get my bags down to the train platform across the street, and refused to take a tip; or the driver who saw me walking down a street in Hiroshima looking for my errant hotel, who saw my lost look, offered his help, and drove me to my lodgings. (READ MORE from Shmuel Klatzkin: The Eclipse Transcends Politics and Division ) I can rely on my Toyota Corolla that I bought new in 2007 and now has over 600k miles on it. These things are in the culture. There were other things in that culture that were prominent eight decades ago—aggression, cruelty, and a disregard for life—especially that of nationalities they considered lesser than their own. They made the Japanese formidable warriors and it made them cruel masters. The Rape of Nanking is a brutal chapter in history; their making sex slaves of thousands of Korean women was horrific. Their cruelty to prisoners of war is infamous. The goal of the nations Japan attacked in World War II was not just to turn Japan back and get it to give back conquered territory. It was also to obliterate its war machine and to remake its culture. Here General Douglas MacArthur had the greatest success of his career. I could feel the result and I admire the culture today. The utopians running American foreign policy feel that people are infinitely malleable and that there are no real constraints on people that can stop them from being perfect. No need to pay attention to culture—if we can imagine a place for them in our thought, that’s good enough. The problem is that most empowered utopians really don’t want to suffer the consequences of their policies, and they don’t much care about those little people to whom those consequences are exclusively diverted. And so they ignore culture. Their utopian program will fix everything and is to be instituted without any thought of the beliefs, attitudes, goals, or behavior of the people they are fixing. But if there is one thing the deeply committed people know, it is how to outlast trends in thought and politics. They think long-term. Whether it is a religion of life or a cult of death, they make plans to survive til their opportunity arises. Thus Hamas waited out the trendiness of the utopians in Israel and the U.S., knowing it would bring them an opportunity to do what is at the core of their religious commitment—bring death to Israel and, they hope, to the United States. That is their culture, which they inculcate from the earliest childhood years. For the West, they make videos of suffering as a consequence of the war they start. On their own media, in their own language, though, they are explicit about their deadly aims, with mothers and grandmothers urging their offspring to become martyrs, so long as they can kill some Jews. (READ MORE: A Political Movement Upends the Word ‘Genocide’ ) Our Utopians at Foggy Bottom pay no attention. They want the outer trappings of peace, They do not have to live next door to the rump of Hamas whose survival they guarantee. So what if another 10,000 rockets fall on Israel. You won’t hear them squawk as they did at Israel’s prosecuting its war against Hamas’ army of rapists. And they will not be there on the receiving end when the next obscene incursion inevitably pours forth. They won’t pay much attention. They care more about their own pristine dream."

"1","Environmentalists in the U.S. and Europe are now shining the spotlight on what we eat, as they once did on what we drive. Is a new meat tax on the horizon? Will farmers be required to offset their carbon footprint? Does it benefit farmers if the IRA withdraws financial assistance to hundreds of conservation, natural resource, and wildlife habitat practices for not being “climate smart”? Will the U.S. repeat the mistakes of the European Union’s green policy that has European farmers up in arms this week ? For the time being, the U.S. farm spending bill being negotiated in Congress will have to maintain the climate funds envisioned by the IRA if it is to be able to count on the Democrats’ vote, as confirmed recently by House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member David Scott. Along with social programs such as reducing hunger or improving equity, the non-negotiable Democratic farm bill proposal includes support for renewable energy and bioenergy, as well as a sustainable agriculture plan that could leave out more than half of currently funded projects. This is one of the reasons why Republicans in the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry denounce the Democratic farm bill as having too much Green New Deal and not enough agriculture. No wonder, considering that our political era has become much more ideological than practical. On the other hand, the Food System Economics Commission, in line with the climate proposals of the Davos World Economic Forum of 2024, has just published the first global report on the environmental costs of not tackling an immediate transformation of the food system to reduce food production and meat consumption. Like all climate change reports, its prognosis and conclusions are a prelude to an apocalypse so immense that it would make an amateur of the French seer Nostradamus. However, they claim that if their recommendations are enforced, the transformation could generate up to $10 trillion in economic benefits per year worldwide, benefits that, according to the commission, would be first and foremost environmental and social. This report is also being debated by the European Commission. On Feb. 5, the EU’s main scientific advisory body recommended a radical reduction in meat consumption and food wastage and criticized those countries that have not yet got up to speed with Brussels’ climate targets. In another less institutional but still influential sphere, last Jan. 28, former White House chef and Barack Obama adviser Sam Kass hosted one of his dinners at a Minneapolis restaurant. It was a climate awareness project eloquently called “The Last Supper.” Attendees paid nearly $300 to taste plates of salmon and oysters and drink coffee and wine and to be lectured during dinner on the idea that all four products could soon become extinct because of global warming. Sam Kass has performed this same show at the COP21 and WEF meetings in Davos, giving high visibility to the idea that a global food restructuring is urgently needed. I do not know if it is necessary to be reminded that the WEF, together with the Food and Agriculture Organization, is one of the international organizations pushing the introduction of insects into our food system — a motion that was crucial for the EU to approve the sale of cricket flour for human consumption last year, in the manufacture of baked goods, thus generating great controversy in public opinion, especially with regard to its confusing labeling regulations. The problem is that, as P.J. O’Rourke wrote in On the Wealth of Nations , “Any advice given to government, no matter how reasonable, intelligent, or well principled, has only one result — more government.” Perhaps that’s why, while sustainable food is the main political issue in the West, European farmers and cattlemen are invading major European cities, riding their tractors in protest against the EU and the national climate laws and bureaucratic hurdles that are ruining their businesses. In an attempt to calm things down, and perhaps to avoid a loss of votes on the eve of the European elections in June 2024, Brussels has withdrawn the project that forced them to reduce the use of pesticides by 50 percent, but even this measure has not succeeded in stopping the demonstrations. The first victim of the environmentalist policies promoted by the globalist elites, both in transportation and food, is individual freedom. Just as it is becoming increasingly difficult and costly to drive the car you want, everything seems to be leading up to a time in the near future in which we will have to get past an increasing number of obstacles in order to eat the food we want to eat. All this on the premise that the only universal consensus on the causes of climate change is that one mustn’t disagree on the causes of climate change. The second group of victims are the farmers and cattlemen themselves, as we are seeing these days in Europe, whose green bureaucratic knot is still more tangled than the one implemented so far in the United States. Most of the tractors in the protests these days carry flags with the logo of the “Sustainable Development Goals” crossed out by a forbidden sign. They state that the 2030 agenda is ruining them, forcing them to comply with endless climate requirements that, on top of it all, the EU does not require for non- EU food, allowing it to be offered at cheaper prices. It is important to underline that the victims are asking not for local protectionism, which would be a setback in the global economy, but only to compete on equal terms with those outside the EU. In short, in terms of its agricultural policy, the United States will have to choose between the (for now) failed EU model, and a model of its own that meets certain reasonable demands of the promoters of sustainable farming, but without restricting freedoms, without flooding commerce with bureaucracy, without skyrocketing public spending, and without ruining the workers in the field. A sensible position that so far only conservatives (and farmers) seem willing to defend, and not even all conservatives."
"1","I n a surprising move, a typically left-of-center Catholic cardinal is praising the Vatican’s new declaration Dignitas infinita for its approach to LGBT issues. In a recent interview, Washington, D.C.’s Cardinal Wilton Gregory said that the new Vatican document, which addresses “gender theory” and transgender genital mutilation surgeries, among other issues, applauded the love with which the Francis pontificate treats those struggling with homosexuality or transgenderism. No, not a false love built on emotional over- sensitivities, but the love of a father (or, more accurately in the case of the Catholic Church, a mother) who seeks the child’s ultimate good, even if the child doesn’t appreciate that particular good. When asked why Pope Francis hasn’t rewritten the Catholic Church’s age-old moral doctrine to approve of homosexual acts and relationships, Gregory replied: “Well, he can’t if he’s going to be true to the Church’s history and its teaching. He can’t ignore the history of our faith, but he can call us to be respectful of others, but also to invite others to see and to appreciate and to accept the Church’s moral teaching.” Gregory added, “I said the most loving parent, at least in my own experience, but watching it in other situations, listens with the heart of the parent to a child, but it doesn’t believe that the child gets everything they ask for.” This is, quite frankly, a surprising insight from Gregory and truly drives at the heart of the “pastoral” spirit that so many priests and bishops today seem to elevate above moral clarity. Priests and bishops are, of course, pastors or shepherds of their flocks, tasked with guiding souls to Heaven. It is very much en vogue (though not quite so en vogue as it has been in recent decades) to preach a strange sort of emotional prosperity gospel: Do what makes you happy — and if sin makes you happy, then can it really be sin? Oughtn’t we, after all, appreciate and enjoy the good that God has given us, even if sin has warped and distorted that good almost beyond recognition? Pastors, shepherds, are to guide their sheep, to keep their flocks safe from ravaging wolves and steep cliffs, not to let their sheep wander where they will because it “feels right” to the sheep. Yet all too often, our shepherds today allow their sheep to graze within inches of the wolf’s jaws, often with some justification such as, “Well, the grass there looks awfully green, and why shouldn’t my sheep enjoy a nice meal?” This notion seemed to peak last year with the publication of Fiducia supplicans , a Vatican directive touted as permitting certain informal types of blessings for same-sex couples, although subsequent clarification made it clear that only individuals were being blessed, not the relationship between the individuals and certainly not the relationship itself. But the Francis pontificate (both the pope and those closest to him) have insisted on pointing out the “good” that can be found in homosexual relationships: stability, companionship, mutual respect and affection. (READ MORE from S.A. McCarthy: The Vatican OK With Normalizing the Exception ) What has been often forgotten by those who ought to be pastors in the Church is that these “goods” are but wavering shadows of the true goods God intended for heterosexual relationships, culminating in marriage and family. What the emotional prosperity preachers call a “stable” relationship between two men might better be called “stagnant.” It cannot grow into a marriage; it cannot blossom into a family. What is called “mutual respect” or “mutual affection” is really nothing of the sort. After all, how can one claim to respect or show affection toward another if one’s very lifestyle is contributing to the other’s spiritual decay? If homosexual relationships are, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church declares, “intrinsically disordered,” can engaging in such a relationship with another really be called a form of love? Whether he meant to or not, Gregory hit that proverbial nail on the head. Holy Mother Church is not, as her enemies would have us believe, a strict and soulless dictator, merely a cabal of closeted old men devising rules to deny pleasure to the populace. She is, instead, a loving mother, listening with care to her children, showering them with the riches of their Father, and always pointing out to them the right path to tread, even if it seems a difficult or arduous one.
